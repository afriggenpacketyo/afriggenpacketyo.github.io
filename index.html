          <p>This opinion article presents a personal essay arguing that choosing a small Bible college over an Ivy League institution like Yale led to a more fulfilling life and stronger faith. The author critiques what they perceive as ideological conformity at elite universities, contrasting it with the focus on character, truth, and intellectual freedom found in their chosen educational path. The decision prioritized spiritual and personal formation over prestige and networking opportunities, a trade-off the author ultimately finds rewarding and valuable for their life.</p>

          <p>Ten years after former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s optimistic declaration "we can do it" regarding the 2015 refugee crisis, Germany is grappling with the long-term consequences. The policy, which welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees, has led to both successful integration stories and significant societal challenges, including rising support for the far-right AfD party. Current political discourse reflects ongoing debates about integration, unemployment among migrants, and the overall success of the initiative, with the current chancellor expressing a more critical view of the policy's outcomes.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," investigates the complexities of chronic pain, identifying the brain as a primary source rather than just the site of injury. The article highlights the story of a musician with a severe pain syndrome who found relief through an experimental deep brain stimulation treatment that interrupts pain signals before they reach conscious awareness. This innovative research suggests that pain is a measurable and treatable brain circuitry issue, offering new hope for millions suffering from conditions previously thought to be unmanageable.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Arch Manning took responsibility for his performance after No. 1 Texas lost its season opener 14-7 to Ohio State, stating he "beat myself today." Manning completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception in his debut as the full-time starter. Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his player against the immense public pressure, criticizing the "out of control" external expectations and urging patience, framing the loss as just the first chapter of a long season ahead.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has announced a significant policy shift, pledging to remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea if her party is elected. The plan aims to "get all our oil and gas out," arguing that current climate-focused regulations are an economic burden that leaves vital resources untapped. This move directly contrasts with the Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses and has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups and other political parties for being reckless.</p>

          <p>A cold case review by Tennessee authorities has concluded that Buford Pusser, the legendary McNairy County sheriff whose story inspired the movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967.

Economists suggest that while some jobs will be lost, AI will also create new, unforeseen roles, though concern remains about how newcomers will gain expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the latest COVID-19 vaccines for specific groups, including adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with certain underlying medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness. While officials state that anyone can get a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the narrower formal approval may create access challenges, particularly in states where pharmacists are restricted from administering vaccines not broadly recommended by the CDC. Conditions that qualify include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, and obesity, covering an estimated 100 to 200 million people.</p>

          <p>The release of transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with the Justice Department has sparked criticism that prosecutors failed to press her for specific names, particularly regarding Jeffrey Epstein's powerful associates. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that some of Epstein's circle were serving in Donald Trump's cabinet, but the interviewer did not ask for clarification or names. This, along with other seemingly soft questioning, has led victims' advocates and legal experts to suggest the disclosure was more for show than a genuine effort to uncover the full extent of Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques President Donald Trump's decision-making, asserting that many of his actions are based on a profound and dangerous ignorance of basic facts rather than political ideology. The piece cites several examples from his presidency, such as his claim to solve California wildfires by releasing water from reservoirs 200 miles away and his misunderstanding of how tariffs work. The author, referencing comments from former aides who allegedly called Trump a "moron," argues that his supreme confidence in his own "gut instinct" often leads to bizarre and harmful policies.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, commemorates the 140th anniversary of surfing's introduction to the U.S. mainland by three Hawaiian princes. In 1885, teenage royals David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui were attending a nearby military school when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood and rode the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of the traditional Hawaiian "surfboard swimming" was documented in a local newspaper and planted the seeds for the sport's eventual popularity in America.</p>

Similar measures are being implemented or proposed in places like Montana and Cape Cod, as states seek new revenue streams amid tight budgets and populist sentiment over housing affordability. However, the taxes have sparked a backlash from real estate brokers and homeowners, who argue they unfairly penalize seasonal residents who contribute significantly to local economies.

The single-use plastic items, which are common in sushi takeaways, are used for mere seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries. While the containers are technically recyclable, their small size makes them difficult for processing machinery to handle correctly, meaning they often end up as waste, prompting the government to include them in its latest legislative ban.</p>
