          <p>Shares for The Trade Desk, an advertising technology company, fell by nearly 40% in a single day, marking a record decline. The dramatic drop was attributed to a combination of factors, including the unexpected departure of its Chief Financial Officer, growing concerns about competition from Amazon's expanding ad business, and the potential macroeconomic impact of U.S. tariffs on advertising spending. Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations, the confluence of leadership uncertainty and competitive threats unsettled investors, leading to a significant sell-off. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has reportedly issued subpoenas to New York Attorney General Letitia James, escalating an investigation into her office's handling of the civil fraud case against former President Trump. The probe, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, is examining whether Trump's civil rights were violated during the investigation that resulted in a massive financial penalty. A spokesperson for James's office condemned the move as a "weaponization of the justice system," asserting that they stand by their litigation.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe incorrectly identified a group of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post, prompting a response from HM Coastguard. The crew was, in fact, rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. After realizing his mistake, Lowe pledged a £1,000 donation to their cause. The rowers, which included a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" and noted the "vigilante-style" response from onlookers on the shore.</p>

This move represents a significant escalation of pressure on the Kremlin, reversing an earlier, more conciliatory stance. While a U.S. Special Envoy recently held what were described as "highly productive" talks with Putin, Trump has since expressed disappointment, leaving markets uncertain about the outcome and the potential for severe economic penalties.

Trent Rockets' captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, delivered a powerful performance, scoring 64 runs from 40 balls in an effort to chase down Phoenix's total of 148. However, her contribution was not enough to overcome the deficit, as her teammates struggled to build momentum. Birmingham Phoenix's innings was anchored by Emma Lamb, who scored 55 runs, setting a challenging target that ultimately proved to be out of reach for the Rockets.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly boosting the digital advertising revenues of major tech companies like Meta and Alphabet, which both reported strong quarterly earnings. These giants are leveraging AI to improve ad system efficiency and targeting, attracting increased spending from e-commerce firms. In contrast, smaller platforms such as Snap and Pinterest are experiencing difficulties, with Snap facing issues from a botched ad platform update and Pinterest citing tariff-related concerns. This trend highlights a growing divergence where larger players capitalize on AI investments while smaller competitors struggle to keep pace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a contentious move within the Republican party, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr is suing his primary rival for governor, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, over campaign finance practices.

Carr argues this creates an unfair and unconstitutional playing field, violating his rights to free speech and equal protection. The Jones campaign has dismissed the lawsuit as hypocritical, pointing out that Carr's office previously defended the very law he is now challenging.</p>

In response, Tan defended his 40-year career, stating he has always operated with the highest ethical standards, while Intel affirmed its commitment to U.S. national security.

This dramatic move is an attempt to block a GOP-led redistricting effort that Democrats argue constitutes unfair gerrymandering. While the quorum break attracts national attention and demonstrates opposition, its long-term success is uncertain, as lawmakers face logistical challenges and mounting pressure to return.

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) will take over the investigation into allegations that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused vulnerable children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. The decision follows reports from five women who said they were exploited by both grooming gangs and police officers. The move to an independent body comes after calls for transparency, as critics argued it was inappropriate for the force to investigate its own former officers. The NCA stated its commitment to ensuring victims remain at the heart of the investigation.</p>

          <p>After a significant surge in price, gold may be poised for a potential decline, offering a more affordable entry point for investors. Several factors could contribute to this, including cooling inflation, which historically has an inverse relationship with the price of gold. A potential easing of geopolitical tensions, another key driver of gold's value as a safe-haven asset, could also lead to a price drop. If these factors materialize, the resulting decrease in investor demand for a hedge against uncertainty could cause prices to retreat from their recent record highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided the clearest image to date of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Discovered last month, the comet is traveling at 130,000 mph and has an icy core estimated to be no more than 3.5 miles wide. The new photographs reveal a teardrop-shaped dust plume and the beginnings of a tail. The comet poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach to the sun in late October before continuing its journey out of our solar system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to end "Solar for All," a $7 billion federal program designed to provide affordable solar energy to low-income communities. The Environmental Protection Agency stated the move is a consequence of a new law that repealed the program's funding source, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The program had aimed to help over 900,000 households reduce utility bills and pollution. However, grantees argue the funds were already legally obligated and are preparing to challenge the administration's ability to reclaim the money in court.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists from East Carolina University has discovered four shipwrecks at a historic site in North Carolina, one of which is believed to be the remains of La Fortuna. This Spanish privateer ship exploded during an attack on the colonial port in 1748. Wood samples suggest the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was found in 1985. The discovery, along with three other wrecks, offers new insights into the colonial maritime history of the region.</p>

The decision, a significant policy shift for one of Israel's staunchest European allies, came in response to Israel's expanded military action in Gaza City. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz cited growing concern for the civilian population and the humanitarian situation as the primary reasons for the halt. The move signals Germany's increasing pressure on Israel regarding its conduct in the war, creating a notable diplomatic rift.</p>

          <p>A massive blob of hot rock, known as the Northern Appalachian Anomaly, located deep beneath New Hampshire, may be responsible for keeping the Appalachian Mountains elevated. New research suggests this thermal anomaly, which is hotter than its surroundings, originated 80 million years ago during the continental rifting between North America and Greenland. Scientists theorize that the heat from this blob makes the continent above it lighter and more buoyant, causing the ancient mountain range to be uplifted. The anomaly is slowly migrating and is projected to be under New York in about 15 million years.</p>
