          <p>England, Scotland, and Ireland have all advanced to the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals following an exciting second round of fixtures. Scotland secured their spot for the first time since 2002 by defeating Fiji, while South Africa achieved a historic win over Italy to also reach the knockout stage. The tournament featured thrilling matches, including a 31-31 draw between Australia and the United States, and memorable moments for underdog teams like Samoa and Brazil, who scored their first World Cup points and try, respectively. Wales, despite a youthful side showing promise, bowed out after a defeat to Canada.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border late Sunday, causing extensive damage and a significant loss of life. Officials initially reported at least 250 fatalities and 500 injuries, with these numbers tragically anticipated to increase as search and rescue teams struggle to reach remote affected areas. Multiple villages in Kunar and Nangahar provinces were either completely destroyed or suffered substantial structural damage, underscoring the region's extreme vulnerability to seismic activity and poor construction. This natural disaster marks another devastating event for Afghanistan, following a catastrophic 6.3 magnitude temblor in October 2023 which resulted in thousands of casualties. The shallow depth of the recent quake, at just five miles, significantly amplified its destructive impact across the densely populated region, shaking buildings as far away as Kabul and Islamabad for several seconds.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to announce a significant tightening of UK asylum rules, specifically impacting migrants' ability to bring family members to the country. New criteria will include tougher English language standards and requirements for sufficient funds, aiming to align the UK with evolving European policies. The reforms also target ending the controversial use of hotels for asylum seekers and strengthening border security efforts against people smugglers, with the National Crime Agency reporting a record number of disruptions. Cooper will further provide an update on a pilot scheme with France, which will see some migrants arriving via small boats detained and returned. The government asserts these comprehensive measures will fix a "broken" asylum system, despite opposition criticism.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged nearly 19% after reporting better-than-expected net income for its June quarter. The robust performance was driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit, fueled by strong artificial intelligence demand, and a continued revival of its e-commerce business. Cloud revenue jumped 26% year-on-year, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Despite heavy investments in competitive "quick commerce" and a decrease in income from operations, investors were optimistic, leading to a 40% rally in its US-listed stock this year.

Experts suggest the drop is due to voluntary departures, deportations, and fears of enforcement actions, with some crops going to waste and construction jobs stalling. The article highlights the significant contribution of immigrants to US job growth and raises concerns about the future labor supply in critical industries.</p>

Rooney's comments followed Arsenal's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, where Dominik Szoboszlai scored the winning goal. While acknowledging Arsenal's quality, Rooney believes Liverpool remains the Premier League title favorite due to their experience in winning the league. He also criticized Arsenal's approach at Anfield, suggesting they should have been "a little bit braver" and taken the game more to Liverpool, rather than playing "to not lose them."</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's state-owned rail operator, has permanently abolished peak time fares starting September 1, offering significant savings for many passengers and aiming to simplify ticketing. This policy change, championed by the Scottish Greens, is designed to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, directly contributing to environmental goals. For instance, a ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will be nearly 50% cheaper, and trips between Perth and Dundee will be a third less than previously. The move follows a previous pilot scheme that ended due to budget pressures but was reinstated by First Minister John Swinney, who highlighted its dual benefits for public finances and carbon emission reduction.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the political discourse surrounding immigration in the UK, exemplified by Brexit and subsequent policies, is an endless cycle where "goalposts always move." It suggests that no amount of crackdown, even severe measures seen in the US under Trump, ever fully appeases anti-immigration sentiment. The piece highlights how the portrayal of migrants as "invaders" leads to increasingly militarized borders and expanded enforcement powers, potentially impacting even citizens in blended families. The author contends that the underlying question isn't "how many is too many," but "how few is few enough," a scenario impossible to achieve, thus perpetuating the crisis narrative.</p>

BBC Panorama revealed that staff were instructed to pose as customers and pretend to make jewellery to create a false impression of a thriving business for potential investors. The company's reported £157 million diamond stock was later valued at only £100,000, leaving investors with nothing. Despite the scale of the alleged fraud, neither the Metropolitan Police nor the Serious Fraud Office are currently investigating Dominguez, who has since disappeared, flying to Dubai on the day the company was wound up.</p>

The company noted that "increased price competition and frequent occurrences of excessive marketing" had an adverse impact on the industry's development. While BYD's first-half net profit and revenue still saw growth, the quarterly results underscore the intense domestic pressures faced by Chinese automakers, even as they expand globally.

This article explores India's "strategic autonomy" as it seeks alternative opportunities with the world's second-largest economy. Despite a significant trade deficit and lingering border disputes, the two Asian giants are taking steps towards normalizing relations, though this pivot could create new challenges for India's ties with other multilateral forums like the Quad.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit officially commenced with President Xi Jinping hosting leaders from its ten member nations, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Founded in 2001 as a Eurasian security bloc with six original members, the SCO has since expanded to include Belarus, India, Iran, and Pakistan, broadening its scope to encompass trade, economics, and cultural cooperation. This grouping is increasingly viewed as an Asian counterweight to Western influence. During the summit, leaders are expected to sign a declaration aimed at strengthening security, economic, and cultural cooperation, underscoring the bloc's growing role in global affairs and fostering dialogue among diverse nations on shared interests.</p>

          <h2>New Book Alleges Queen Camilla Fought Off Attempted Sexual Assault as a Teenager</h2>

          <p>A new book about the Royal Family, "Power and the Palace" by Valentine Low, recounts an alleged attempted sexual assault on Queen Camilla when she was a teenager. The article states that Camilla, then 16 or 17, reportedly fought off her attacker on a train to Paddington Station using the heel of her shoe, following advice from her mother. She later reported the incident, leading to the man's arrest. Buckingham Palace has not disputed the account. This revelation adds context to the Queen's extensive public work supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, though sources indicate her advocacy stemmed from hearing victims' stories rather than this personal experience.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been arrested in Sydney after allegedly crashing a car through the gates of the Russian consulate in Woollahra, causing property damage. Police were initially called to the scene following reports of an unauthorized vehicle and attempted to speak with the driver before the incident occurred. One officer sustained a minor hand injury during the event, but no other casualties were reported, which is fortunate given the nature of the crash. Authorities have not yet disclosed the driver's identity or motivation, stating that inquiries are actively ongoing to determine the full circumstances surrounding this incident at the diplomatic premises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children, just as planes were prepared for takeoff from Texas. U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued a broader temporary restraining order, lasting 14 days, preventing the removal of any unaccompanied Guatemalan children in US custody without a deportation order. The Justice Department claimed these were "repatriations" for family reunification, but advocacy groups argued the children were being denied legal protections and faced risks of abuse. This extraordinary ruling halted a hurried government plan executed during a holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Following a US federal judge's order to halt the deportation of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children, the Guatemalan government stated it had proposed their return to the Department of Homeland Security. The government cited a desire to prevent children from remaining in shelters and detention centers, emphasizing support for family reunification and plans to integrate the children into social programs upon their return. While asserting that all actions comply with human rights and due process, attorneys representing the children dispute this, believing the US government violated federal laws and the Constitution by attempting to remove them without allowing asylum claims.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal that Vietnam has significantly expanded all 21 of its occupied features in the contested Spratly Islands, including artificial land and infrastructure like munitions storage. This ongoing reclamation effort puts Vietnam on track to surpass China in such activities within the archipelago, which is also claimed by Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei. Analysts suggest these actions demonstrate Vietnam's resolve to solidify its claims and offset China's earlier strategic advantages. While not expected to drastically alter the overall strategic equation, observers caution that Beijing might respond by upgrading its own defense posture in the highly sensitive South China Sea.</p>
