          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May year-over-year, the most significant drop since last October, signaling that Beijing's stimulus measures are not yet fully effective. The National Bureau of Statistics cites weak domestic demand and falling industrial product prices as primary causes for the downturn. Despite a rise in retail sales, businesses have not seen increased profitability due to widespread price wars and promotions. Economists are divided on whether this data will prompt further government stimulus, with some believing robust GDP growth reduces the urgency for immediate action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed deep concern over the current state of political discourse in the United States, stating that "democracy is at risk."

China's Commerce Ministry confirmed it would accelerate the approval of export licenses for rare earth minerals, a key point of contention for the U.S. The agreement comes as both economies show signs of strain from the ongoing trade dispute, impacting factory profits in China and contributing to economic contraction in the U.S.</p>

The government's controversial decision to means-test the winter fuel payment and a subsequent major U-turn on welfare reforms following a backbench rebellion have raised questions about his authority.

This figure, released by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, indicates there were 124 available jobs for every 100 people seeking employment. The ministry suggests the decrease is due to an increase in the number of workers seeking new positions with better conditions as a response to persistent inflation. This trend points to a shifting labor market dynamic as workers actively seek to offset rising living costs. (not investment advice)</p>

This spike in U.S. sales was driven by consumer concerns that vehicle prices could increase due to high tariffs recently imposed by the Trump administration.

          <p>The Japanese government has officially approved the evacuation plans for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, a critical step toward potentially restarting the facility. The plant, operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company, has been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The approval from the national government's nuclear disaster prevention council, chaired by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, now moves the final decision to the local level. Securing consent from residents in the Niigata Prefecture remains the last major hurdle before the world's largest nuclear plant can resume operations.</p>

          <p>A 1975 agreement between Germany and Brazil for nuclear energy cooperation is reaching its 50th anniversary, reigniting debate over its legacy and future. The deal, which originally aimed to build eight nuclear plants in Brazil, has been criticized for its high costs, limited success, and environmental risks, with only one plant fully operational. While Germany's Green Party has long advocated for terminating the treaty, especially after Germany's own nuclear phase-out, some politicians see it as a milestone in technological partnership. The agreement's future is uncertain amid a global resurgence of interest in nuclear power.</p>

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted of murdering nine people in 2017. Shiraishi, dubbed the "Twitter killer," contacted his victims, aged 15 to 26, on the social media platform after they posted about suicidal thoughts, luring them to his apartment where he killed and dismembered them. He was also convicted of sexually abusing his eight female victims. The execution occurs amid ongoing debate in Japan over the use of capital punishment, a practice that retains strong public support despite criticism from international human rights groups.</p>

          <p>California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has lifted "modified program" restrictions at nine state prisons, restoring privileges like visits and phone calls. However, twelve other prisons remain on lockdown following a statewide surge in violence and suspected drug overdoses that prompted the initial measures on June 12. During the two-week lockdown, investigators conducted extensive searches, uncovering 169 weapons and 310 contraband cellphones. The CDCR initiated the lockdown after 13 inmates were killed by other prisoners this year.</p>

          <p>A tragic collision between a vehicle and a South Shore Line train in Gary, Indiana, has resulted in the deaths of five people, all members of the same family. According to officials, the vehicle went around the lowered crossing gates and into the path of the oncoming train. The five occupants, identified as three men and two women all in their early 20s, were ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene. No one on the train, which was carrying 32 passengers, was injured. Officials reiterated the critical importance of never driving around activated railroad crossing gates.</p>
