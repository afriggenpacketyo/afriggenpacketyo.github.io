          <p>German sportswear company Adidas has issued a public apology after being accused of cultural appropriation. The controversy surrounds a new shoe design inspired by traditional "huarache" sandals from the Indigenous Yalalag community in Oaxaca, Mexico, who were not involved in the product's creation. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Oaxaca's governor criticized the design as an inappropriate use of cultural heritage. This incident highlights Mexico's 2022 legislation that protects Indigenous cultural property, making unauthorized use a punishable offense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has extended the tariff truce with China by 90 days, temporarily averting an immediate escalation in the trade dispute. The decision, confirmed by a White House official, came just hours before the previous ceasefire was set to expire. This extension follows recent trade negotiations between the two countries in Stockholm. Ahead of the announcement, President Trump had publicly urged China to significantly increase its purchases of American soybeans to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to negotiate the return of occupied Ukrainian territory during his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump characterized the summit as an initial "feel-out meeting" to gauge the possibility of a deal to end the war. He stated he would consult with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before and after the talks. In response, Zelensky emphasized that any agreement made without Kyiv's involvement would be considered a "dead decision."</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unconventional deal, giving the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Analysts view the arrangement as a transactional move typical of the Trump administration, securing market access for the companies while setting a new precedent. Investors reacted positively, seeing 85% of revenue as better than zero and a way to compete with Chinese rival Huawei. However, the deal raises long-term uncertainty about future government demands and China's reaction to what some view as an "indirect tariff." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares in cannabis companies experienced a rally after President Trump announced he is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug category under federal law. A decision is expected within the next few weeks. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III could ease tax burdens and stimulate investment in the industry. While the President cannot unilaterally reclassify the drug, his public support has generated significant optimism among investors and industry leaders like Tilray's CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, signaling a potential recovery. The theater chain posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, a 35% increase year-over-year, and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, or 1 cent per share. CEO Adam Aron attributed the strong performance to a recovering industry-wide box office and a 26% increase in attendance. The company also made progress in managing its debt, pushing all 2026 maturities to 2029. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising living costs, a reverse mortgage is presented as a potential financial tool for certain seniors. The article suggests three groups who could benefit: those needing to supplement a fixed retirement income, those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash for unexpected costs, and those who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. By borrowing against home equity, these seniors can access tax-free funds without incurring monthly payments. However, the article advises a full understanding of the risks before proceeding.

          <p>The United Nations human rights office has condemned an Israeli airstrike that killed five Al Jazeera journalists and a freelancer in Gaza, calling it a grave breach of international law. Israel's military claimed it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim he had denied and for which Israel has provided little evidence. The attack has drawn widespread condemnation from media rights groups and other nations. This incident brings the number of journalists killed in the conflict to at least 186, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's decision to review a Louisiana case on racial gerrymandering does not threaten the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but rather seeks to align with its original color-blind principles. The author contends that creating race-based "safe seats" for politicians betrays the act's text, which protects an individual's right to vote, not a group's right to proportional representation. The piece suggests that ending racial gerrymandering would move the U.S. toward a democracy where voters choose representatives based on values, not race.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a $2 billion investment to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new line of more affordable electric vehicles. This is part of a larger "Universal EV Program" aimed at creating what CEO Jim Farley calls a "Model T moment" for the company. The first vehicle from this program, a midsize electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch, will have a starting price of around $30,000. The investment is expected to secure about 2,200 jobs, though the plant will employ fewer workers once retooled for EV production. (not investment advice)</p>
