          <p>Following a public dispute between President Trump and Elon Musk, staff members at the Musk-founded Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are reportedly anxious about their future within the government and potential political repercussions. Some fear that their association with DOGE could make them targets if the feud escalates, while others worry that distancing from DOGE could become a professional liability. Despite the conflict, the White House maintains that the mission of eliminating waste and fraud remains a priority, with leadership now residing with the President and his cabinet. Some DOGE staffers are seeking employment elsewhere, while tech companies are actively recruiting DOGE alumni. The optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering selling or giving away the red Model S Tesla he purchased in March following a public falling out with Elon Musk. Trump had originally bought the electric vehicle to show support for Tesla and Musk, who faced criticism for his involvement with DOGE. The move signals a further distancing between the President and the Tesla CEO after their alliance dramatically ruptured. The Tesla was bought in response to attacks on Tesla vehicles and locations linked to the company. The optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

          <p>The review of the horror film “Dangerous Animals” suggests that while director Sean Byrne is known for his ability to create suspenseful and unsettling experiences, this film falls short of his previous work.

Despite a promising setup, the movie is described as predictable and underwhelming, lacking the thematic depth and surprises of Byrne's earlier films.

          <p>An auditors' report has concluded that there was a "pervasive fraud environment" at Unite, one of the UK's largest trade unions. The report highlights "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers, along with a culture that did not challenge financial transactions. This relates to the union spending £112m on a hotel and conference center in Birmingham, which has since been valued at a fraction of that sum. General Secretary Sharon Graham ordered the probe and has vowed to take steps to prevent such occurrences in the future. The optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>
