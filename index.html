        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's central bank has cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to a new low of 3.6%, responding to substantially lower inflation and a slowing economy. The move was widely anticipated by economists, as inflation has fallen close to the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range. This decision comes amid a challenging trade environment and weaker-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter, which was impacted by reduced public spending and consumer demand. Analysts predict further rate cuts later in the year to continue supporting the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of anticompetitive behavior related to the App Store rankings of his Grok AI chatbot. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to achieve top rankings, calling it an "unequivocal antitrust violation." This follows Musk's previous criticism of Apple's integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the operating system level, which he labeled an unacceptable security risk. The threat adds to existing antitrust challenges Apple faces, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>In a trial for a lawsuit filed by California Governor Gavin Newsom against the Trump administration, a high-ranking general testified about the controversial 2024 deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The case centers on whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. Major General Scott Sherman, who commanded the task force, stated in court that he never heard the protests described as a "rebellion," undermining a key justification the administration used for the federal action.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected an unusual request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss the case against a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who was already convicted by a jury for using excessive force. The judge called the government's motion "contrary to the public interest" and ordered the deputy, Trevor Kirk, to begin his four-month prison sentence. The attempt to overturn the conviction came after a new, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney took over the Los Angeles office and had already triggered the resignations of several prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Two parents from Needles, California, have been arrested on suspicion of child abuse after their 2-year-old toddler was discovered wandering alone and barefoot on a railroad overpass. When the parents arrived at the scene, authorities from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department determined they were intoxicated from a stimulant. The child was taken into protective custody by Child and Family Services, while the parents were booked into jail. The father is being held without bail for a potential parole violation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing a period of intense heat, with amber health alerts issued for most of southern and central England as temperatures are forecast to reach as high as 34°C (93°F). The heatwave coincides with growing concerns about water scarcity. A national drought group has warned that England is now experiencing "nationally significant" water shortfalls, which are affecting crop yields, livestock, and natural ecosystems, while also increasing the risk of wildfires. Conditions are expected to ease slightly before rising again over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers from Texas have remained outside the state to prevent the Republican-led legislature from achieving the quorum needed to pass a controversial redistricting plan favored by Donald Trump. This standoff has escalated a national political battle, prompting Democratic governors in states like California and New York to threaten retaliatory redistricting if the Texas plan moves forward. Texas Republicans have responded by issuing civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats and have asked the state's supreme court to vacate their seats.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and is placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control to address what he calls a crisis of "crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor." The action, authorized under a provision of the D.C. Home Rule Act, was immediately criticized by local officials. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move unsettling and pointed to data showing that violent crime in the city has actually been declining.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District is expanding "safe passage" zones around at least 100 schools, partly in response to an incident where federal immigration agents mistakenly detained a 15-year-old student at gunpoint. The action comes amid widespread community fears about immigration raids near campuses. The safe zones will involve school police, staff, and community volunteers forming protective perimeters to ensure student safety. Local officials have affirmed that neither school nor city police assist with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>In Mexico City's Xochimilco borough, scientists are filtering canal water to find traces of environmental DNA (eDNA) from the critically endangered axolotl. With the salamander population having plummeted from 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014, physical sightings are nearly impossible. This eDNA technique allows researchers from Mexico’s National Autonomous University to monitor the species' presence and the effectiveness of protected refuge areas, offering a non-invasive way to track the elusive creature's fight for survival.</p>

          <p>The Nigerian military has announced that a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara resulted in the deaths of more than 100 armed gang members. The operation was initiated after surveillance identified over 400 gang members, locally known as "bandits," preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been responsible for terrorizing communities across the region, frequently kidnapping for ransom and clashing with security forces. Despite repeated military efforts, violence and instability persist in the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's decision to federalize the Washington, D.C. police and deploy the National Guard, framing it as an authoritarian political maneuver. The author argues the move is based on misleading and out-of-date crime statistics and is intended to create a "visually friendly PR win" rather than address public safety effectively. The piece warns that the action sets a dangerous precedent for using armed forces in American cities, drawing comparisons to the anti-democratic crackdowns of leaders like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele.</p>
