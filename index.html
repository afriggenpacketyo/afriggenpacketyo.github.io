          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the Minnesota lawmaker shootings, was described as a frustrated idealist, according to his writings and a web designer who worked with him for over a decade. Before the alleged "political assassination," Boelter appeared to be deeply religious and passionate, with a sincere desire to serve the greater good. He had grand, civic-minded ideas on how to improve the world and believed he had solutions to societal problems. The projects he envisioned were often large-scale and ambitious, but most never came to fruition, which may have contributed to his eventual violent actions.</p>

          <p>Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, a rapper from the Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap, was released on unconditional bail after being charged with a terror offense in London. The charge stems from an incident where Ã“ hAnnaidh allegedly displayed a flag in support of Hezbollah, a proscribed organization, at a London gig. Supporters of the group gathered outside the courthouse, and the next hearing is scheduled for August 20. The case has drawn attention due to its implications for free speech and the expression of political views, but the prosecution insists the case is specifically about support for a proscribed terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not contact Minnesota Governor Tim Walz following the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers, one of whom died, because he deemed the governor "whacked out" and the call a waste of time. This decision contrasts with the typical presidential practice of offering condolences to elected officials during times of tragedy. Walz's office responded that the tragedy was not about Trump or Walz, but about the families affected and the state of Minnesota. Vice President JD Vance spoke with Walz on Saturday to coordinate between federal and state law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Israeli strikes hit two centrifuge facilities in Iran, specifically the TESA Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Center. These facilities are used for manufacturing and testing advanced centrifuge rotors and components, which are essential for uranium enrichment. Both sites were previously under IAEA monitoring as part of the JCPOA, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. The strikes further escalate tensions in the region and raise concerns about the potential for nuclear proliferation.</p>

          <p>The Premier League has released its 2025-26 season fixtures, but warned of potential changes at short notice due to the increased number of teams participating in European competitions. With nine teams in Europe, scheduling conflicts are likely to arise, particularly for teams progressing to the knockout rounds. England boss Thomas Tuchel will face challenges with Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester City playing key matches before international windows. The first expanded lot of TV fixtures will require careful juggling to accommodate Champions League representatives playing on Tuesdays.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government, involving strategic alterations to products' materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into lower-tariff categories. Despite broad-based tariffs, exemptions exist, allowing companies to benefit through creative product tweaks. This practice, legal as long as goods are honestly presented to customs, enables manufacturers to reduce duty liabilities by reclassifying items. Industries such as consumer goods and apparel find it easier to implement tariff engineering compared to heavily regulated sectors like automotive and aerospace.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, charged with the murder of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, could face the death penalty, a rarity in Minnesota, due to federal charges. Federal prosecutors have taken the lead in the case, potentially overshadowing state charges and raising tensions with the Hennepin County Attorney. The decision to pursue the death penalty will be a challenge, given Minnesota's history of rejecting capital punishment. The federal intervention suggests national interest in the case, and Boelter's next federal court appearance is scheduled for June 27.</p>

Trump demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender" and claimed the U.S. and Israel have total control of Iranian airspace.

Iran's Fordow plant, built deep underground, is impenetrable by most bombs, necessitating the use of the U.S.'s GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator. A strike could trigger retaliation from Iran, potentially targeting U.S. assets in the region, leading to a broader military engagement. Beyond nuclear sites, there are considerations of targeting other Iranian assets and regime change, urged by Israel, which further complicates the situation.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable rocket, marking a significant step in its expansion into the space sector. The test flight, conducted on Hokkaido, Japan, saw the prototype rocket reach an altitude of nearly 300 meters before landing close to its designated spot. The company aims to develop the technology for a suborbital launch by 2029, anticipating increased demand for satellite launch rockets. This initiative leverages Honda's existing technologies from product development and automated driving systems.</p>

          <p>The U.K. Parliament has voted to decriminalize some late-term abortions in England and Wales, marking a significant reform to British abortion laws. The new legislation prevents women from being investigated, arrested, prosecuted, or imprisoned for terminating their own pregnancies, regardless of the term. This change addresses cases where women have ended pregnancies outside of approved settings, such as buying pills online. The law still requires approval in the House of Lords, and it does not change rules for abortions in clinical settings or prosecutions for those assisting women in late-term abortions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his rhetoric against Iran, threatening to target its supreme leader and claiming control of Iranian skies, signaling potential U.S. involvement in the conflict. Meanwhile, U.S. street drug deaths are rising again after a year of decline, according to the CDC. Additionally, employers in agriculture, construction, and hospitality are concerned about potential workforce losses due to Homeland Security's targeting of industries employing undocumented individuals.

Only the U.S. has access to the GBU-57 and the B-2 Spirit bomber required to deliver it.
