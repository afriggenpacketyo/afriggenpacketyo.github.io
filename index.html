          <h2>Satellite to Measure Carbon Stored in Earth's Forests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 05:38:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new European Space Agency satellite, nicknamed "space brolly," is set to launch to accurately measure the amount of carbon stored in the world's rainforests. The Biomass satellite uses a long wavelength radar to penetrate through clouds and forest canopies, analyzing slices of trees to determine the amount of woody material, a proxy for carbon dioxide storage. This data will help scientists improve climate change models and track deforestation rates, offering a consistent view of forests regardless of cloud cover. The satellite's mission is expected to last five years, with initial maps produced within six months of a successful launch.</p>

          <p>Despite polling indicating broad disapproval of President Trump's handling of the economy, tariffs, and stock market volatility, his 2024 voters largely remain confident in his leadership. Many believe Trump will turn the economy around, citing concerns about waste under the previous administration and expressing optimism about his policies strengthening the economy in the long term. While some Trump voters acknowledge potential short-term challenges from tariffs and stock market fluctuations, they generally support his efforts to bring back jobs to America and view his approach as necessary to make the country competitive. However, some voters also express concerns about rising prices and the potential for a recession.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has been marked by numerous executive actions aimed at overhauling the federal government and pushing his agenda, leading to economic anxiety among Americans. Despite promises of economic grandeur, polls show that a majority of Americans believe Trump's policies will likely cause a recession in the short term. This has put a strain on the Republican Party, especially in vulnerable districts, while the Democratic Party is undergoing soul-searching to determine its future messaging and leadership.

          <p>Taiwan has launched a coordinated response platform to address disruptions to undersea cables, vital for the island's communications infrastructure. This initiative follows accusations that China is behind recent cable damage incidents. The Regional Response Platform for Submarine Cable Security brings together Taiwan's coastguard, prosecutors, telecoms operators, and investigators to crack down on criminal activities targeting these cables. The Ocean Affairs Council described undersea cables as Taiwan's "digital lifeline," highlighting the urgency of protecting this critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is attempting to regain its footing in the Chinese market with the upcoming releases of major American productions, despite recent trade tensions and declining revenues. Marvel's *Thunderbolts* and Disney's live-action remake of *Lilo & Stitch* are slated for release in China, signaling a potential hold-off on a Hollywood curb by Beijing. However, the US film industry continues to face challenges as Chinese audiences increasingly favor domestically made films. The industry has seen its revenues in China plummet since its pre-pandemic heyday, as Chinese audiences turn away from American content in favor of domestically made films that have rapidly closed the gap in terms of production quality.</p>

          <p>Albania has lost a significant portion of its forest cover in the past two decades, driven by high demand for wood fuel, particularly from Italy. Despite a moratorium on commercial logging, illegal felling continues, with sawmills operating across the country, often cutting down valuable beech trees under the guise of firewood permits. Local authorities are responsible for managing forests, but corruption and lack of enforcement hinder efforts to protect them. The European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR) aims to prevent illegal timber from entering the EU market, but experts say it has limited effectiveness in Albania due to widespread corruption.</p>

Carney, a political newcomer, successfully portrayed himself as a leader who could protect Canada from Trump's policies. While the Conservatives made gains, they fell short of victory, and the election highlighted divisions within Canada, particularly between the oil-rich provinces and the central government. Carney plans to start negotiations on a new economic and security relationship with the US, acknowledging that the old relationship is "over."</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is expected to form a government in Canada, although it is unclear if they will secure a majority. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, are set to remain in opposition. Both the Liberals and Conservatives have seen a significant rise in their share of the national vote, at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the New Democratic Party (NDP). Jagmeet Singh, the NDP's leader, lost his own seat in the House of Commons.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic and existential threats against Canada played a significant role in the Canadian election, leading to a victory for the Liberal party led by Mark Carney. Carney successfully portrayed himself as a leader who could protect Canada from Trump's policies. While the Conservatives increased their seat count, they still lost the election. Carney must now address issues beyond the border, including the cost of living, housing, and the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars announced plans to cut costs by $1.87 billion and withdrew its financial guidance after experiencing a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter. The company attributed the results to a drop in wholesales, adverse currency effects, and broader automotive industry turbulence. The cost-cutting plan will include reductions in investments and potential layoffs at its operations worldwide. Volvo Cars cited tariff pressure on the automotive sector as a factor in its decision to withdraw financial guidance.</p>

The government is also proposing to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy. The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the government now believes that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar. The consultation on the proposed changes will run until July 21.</p>
