          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 00:18:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the death of Charlie Kirk, the US faces a critical juncture marked by heightened political division and violence, prompting concerns about the nation's ability to unite. Despite historical precedents of division, the current climate is exacerbated by social media's role in fueling outrage and rewarding extremism, according to Utah Governor Spencer Cox. While some see parallels with past periods of political turmoil, the incentive structures that reward division pose a unique challenge to reconciliation. Experts suggest focusing on societal factors causing ungovernability rather than adhering to left-right divisions, and that strong leadership is needed to break the cycle of division and foster unity. The current political climate is creating a sense of pessimism, with no clear path out of this. </p>

          <p>ABC has suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's controversial remarks linking Charlie Kirk's alleged killer to Donald Trump's MAGA movement, prompting praise from Trump and scrutiny from the FCC. Nexstar Media Group also preempted the show on its affiliated stations, citing Kimmel's offensive comments. The move sparked debate about free speech, with some condemning ABC's decision as censorship and others supporting it as a response to insensitive remarks. Other media figures have also faced backlash for their comments about Kirk's death, highlighting the charged atmosphere surrounding the incident. The suspension raises questions about the boundaries of political commentary and the responsibilities of media outlets. </p>

          <p>China is showcasing AI-enhanced bodycams to developing nations at a police expo in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province. The exhibition, themed “Security Sharing, Development Integration,” features criminal technology, police protective gear, vehicles, and counterterrorism equipment. A key highlight is an intelligent command center system incorporating body cameras with AI-assisted facial recognition. These bodycams can link to facial data of high-risk individuals, using AI to identify features, issue alerts, and send information to the command center. The system's terminal, resembling a smartphone, is designed for police operational environments with military-grade drop resistance. </p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student linked to pro-Palestinian protests, to be deported to Algeria or Syria. Khalil, a green card holder, claims the Trump administration targeted him for his activism against Israel's actions in Gaza. The judge denied Khalil's motion for a waiver, citing misrepresentations on his green card paperwork, and ordered his deportation. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal and amend his lawsuit against the administration, arguing the judge rushed to a decision and engaged in procedural irregularities. </p>
