            <p>President Trump is expanding his campaign against perceived political adversaries by scrutinizing the tax-exempt status of law firms, universities, and advocacy groups. This move follows earlier actions against law firms and universities, threatening their independence and financial stability. Advocacy groups, particularly those critical of Trump's policies, are bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, which could significantly impact their operations. The administration's actions are testing the limits of executive power and raising concerns about government overreach and the suppression of dissent.</p>

            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people, including two Britons and two Israelis, according to initial reports. The cabin plunged to the ground after a cable snapped near the top of Mount Faito. Rescue efforts were hampered by poor weather conditions, and an investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the accident. This tragedy evokes memories of a similar incident in 2021, when a cable car accident in northern Italy claimed 14 lives.</p>

            <p>Director James Cameron, known for films like "The Terminator," has revised his perspective on artificial intelligence, now viewing it as a tool to enhance VFX workflows and reduce production costs in Hollywood. He has joined Stability AI's board to explore AI integration, aiming to double VFX production speed rather than replace artists. While acknowledging concerns about copyright and originality, Cameron believes AI can streamline tasks like rotoscoping, allowing artists to focus on more creative aspects of filmmaking. He distinguishes between AI as a tool and the potential dangers of weaponized AI, a theme explored in his earlier work.</p>

The report also suggests that the plan has fostered unhealthy industrial competition and exacerbated global trade tensions. Despite these setbacks, China has made significant progress in certain areas, transforming itself into a major driver of global manufacturing value-add.</p>
