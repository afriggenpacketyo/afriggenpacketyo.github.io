          <h2>Polls Indicate Declining American Confidence in Trump</h2>

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decrease in Americans' faith in Donald Trump, even among Republicans, regarding key issues such as the economy and immigration policy. One survey indicated that a majority of respondents found Trump's second term so far to be "scary," while others showed disapproval of his trade policies and workforce reductions. These findings suggest a growing sense of fatigue among Americans following recent financial market instability and deportations, including those of documented individuals. The polls, conducted by various organizations including the Associated Press and Fox News, highlight a significant shift in public sentiment compared to Trump's first term. Optimism is waning amidst concerns about rising prices and potential recession.</p>

          <p>While attending Pope Francis's funeral at the Vatican, Donald Trump had a revelation regarding Russia's actions in Ukraine, posting on Truth Social that Putin may not want to stop the war, seemingly contradicting his previous stance. This realization came after a conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has struggled to convey this message to Trump for months. The encounter could potentially influence Trump's approach to the conflict, although his mercurial nature makes any lasting change uncertain. The meeting, described as symbolic by Zelenskyy, occurred against the backdrop of tensions between the US and Europe, with the late Pope's message of building bridges resonating during the service.</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, resulted in eight fatalities and over 750 injuries, causing widespread damage to nearby buildings and infrastructure. The blast, felt up to 50km away, was followed by a fire that rapidly spread through the container storage area. Early reports suggest the explosion may have been linked to the improper handling of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles, with warnings about safe chemical storage previously issued to the port. Investigations are ongoing to determine the exact cause and assess the full extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>The Gran Abuelo, a 5,400-year-old alerce tree in Chile, is threatened by a proposed highway that would cut through the protected Alerce Costero National Park. This ancient tree, also known as Patagonian cypress, is not only the world's oldest but also a crucial record-keeper of climate patterns, with each ring representing a year's weather data. Scientists warn that the road will increase the risk of wildfires and disrupt the ecosystem, potentially endangering the alerce trees, which are already an endangered species. Researchers are advocating to protect the tree and its surrounding rainforest, emphasizing their importance in understanding and combating climate change.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the feasibility of Apple's plan to move U.S. iPhone assembly to India, citing concerns about cost reduction and continued reliance on Chinese components. Moffett suggests that Apple's supply chain would remain anchored in China and face potential resistance in India. He also notes that tariffs and declining consumer demand could negatively impact Apple's sales. Moffett has a "sell" rating on Apple and a price target of $141, implying a significant drop from its current value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charles Burnett's "Killer of Sheep," now restored in 4K, offers an unvarnished portrayal of Black working-class life in 1970s Los Angeles. The film follows Stan, a slaughterhouse worker in Watts, and his family, capturing their everyday struggles and resilience. Eschewing stereotypes, the film presents a nuanced depiction of the Great Migration and the challenges faced by Black families seeking a fresh start in L.A. With its soulful soundtrack and understated beauty, "Killer of Sheep" remains a powerful and influential work of American neorealism.</p>
