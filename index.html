          <p>Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen stated his country possesses Chinese-made weapons capable of reaching Bangkok, prompting regional concern. A former Chinese military instructor, Song Zhongping, commented that China's weapon sales are defensive and that Beijing would prefer to mediate any disputes between its two "traditional friends." The situation highlights the delicate geopolitical balance in Southeast Asia, with Thailand being a traditional U.S. ally while Cambodia maintains close ties with China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly voted to advance a major piece of legislation, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by former President Donald Trump. The advancement came after prolonged negotiations to secure the votes of four conservative holdouts, who expressed concerns about deficit reduction and Medicaid. Key to flipping their votes was a promise for an amendment vote on Medicaid funding. The lengthy bill will now proceed through further legislative steps, though its final passage is not yet guaranteed.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has sharply criticized the decision to host the Club World Cup in the United States, calling a two-hour weather delay during a match a "joke." The suspension, due to thunderstorms, was the sixth such interruption in the tournament, raising concerns about player safety and game integrity. The incident highlights potential logistical challenges for the upcoming 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host, given the country's extreme summer weather patterns.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart uranium enrichment within "a matter of months," despite recent US-led strikes on its nuclear facilities. This assessment contradicts claims that the program was "totally obliterated," suggesting the damage was not total and Iran's industrial capabilities remain. The statement comes amid heightened tensions, with Iran refusing IAEA inspections of the damaged sites and vowing to respond if attacked again.</p>

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's success and goals. While the President claimed the facilities were "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the setback to Iran's program was only temporary. Aides later appeared to shift the objective, framing the strikes as a successful effort to broker a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, rather than a complete destruction of nuclear capabilities. This has led to ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage inflicted.</p>

          <p>The recent bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities is characteristic of President Donald Trump's approach to military force, described as a "One-and-Done Doctrine." This strategy favors discrete, high-impact strikes over sustained campaigns, reflecting his aversion to "endless wars." While he has authorized significant operations like the Soleimani strike and the recent Iran bombing, he prefers to see them as decisive, isolated actions. This approach has evolved with a more confident president surrounded by advisers less inclined to challenge his instincts.</p>

          <p>The surprisingly restrained reactions from China and Russia to the recent military strikes on Iran suggest that the so-called "anti-American axis" is less cohesive than often portrayed. Instead of a robust defense of their partner, both Beijing and Moscow prioritized caution and called for diplomacy, highlighting their own economic and strategic interests. This analysis suggests that while the three nations are united by antagonism toward the West, this alliance is transactional and may crumble when tested by direct military confrontation that threatens global stability.</p>

          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for California's seismic readiness. The quake exposed deadly flaws in unreinforced brick buildings, a vulnerability that took decades for many cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a cohesive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, reshaping the city's identity. Experts note that despite progress, many buildings remain vulnerable, highlighting an ongoing reluctance to enforce stricter safety mandates.</p>

          <p>BÃ¤rbel Bas, a politician from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), alongside Lars Klingbeil. Representing the party's left wing, her rise is seen as a source of new hope for the ailing party, which suffered a historic defeat in the last election. Bas, who is also Germany's new labor minister, now faces the daunting task of rebuilding the SPD while tackling major national issues like pension and unemployment benefit reform.</p>

          <p>Irish and British & Irish Lions winger James Lowe has brushed off attempts by a Perth stadium announcer to troll players born in the southern hemisphere. Before a match against Western Force, the announcer pointedly noted the "Kiwi now Irishman" and other players of Australian or South African origin on the Lions squad. Lowe, who previously played for the Maori All Blacks against the Lions, responded with humor, stating he is used to such banter and that the team's performance is what matters.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Sir Elton John and Jeanne White-Ginder, mother of the late HIV/AIDS activist Ryan White, celebrate the progress made in fighting the epidemic but warn against proposed budget cuts. They highlight the success of the Ryan White CARE Act and the End the HIV Epidemic initiative in saving lives and reducing infections. The authors argue that cutting funding for surveillance, testing, and prevention programs, as well as for Medicaid, would threaten to reverse decades of hard-won gains and undermine the goal of ending AIDS by 2030.</p>

In social media posts, Trump described the trial as a "POLITICAL WITCH HUNT" that distracts from negotiations and interferes in Israel's domestic affairs. His call to "MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA" comes as an Israeli official confirmed plans for Netanyahu to visit Washington, signaling potential movement in ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>Couples planning weddings are facing unexpected costs as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods impact the bridal industry. With an estimated 90% of wedding dresses made in China, new tariffs have led designers and boutiques to add surcharges or raise prices, sometimes by as much as 30%. This has created uncertainty for both store owners, who struggle to budget for future costs, and brides, who face higher prices and potential delays, adding a layer of financial anxiety to wedding planning.
