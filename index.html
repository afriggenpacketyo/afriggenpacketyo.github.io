          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly objected to the planned deployment of a U.S.-made Typhon missile system in Japan during upcoming joint military exercises. The system is scheduled to be deployed for the first time at the U.S. Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi prefecture as part of a large-scale training exercise with China as the notional adversary. Analysts interpret this move as a strategic signal from the U.S. and Japan regarding potential conflicts over Taiwan, while Beijing warns it undermines the security interests of other nations. The system is expected to be withdrawn after the exercises conclude.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying between Texas and California, the nation's two most populous states, with significant implications for the U.S. House of Representatives. After Texas Republicans passed a measure to create five new GOP-favoring districts mid-decade, California Democrats responded with a plan to add five Democratic-leaning seats to neutralize the move. This "political arms race," encouraged by former President Trump, is spreading to other states like Missouri, as both parties seek to gain an advantage ahead of the midterm elections. The practice, known as gerrymandering, is legal unless ruled to be racially motivated.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the entire United States. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the expansion, which would apply to migrants anywhere in the country who cannot prove they have been present for over two years, likely violates due process rights. Previously, this policy was limited to migrants apprehended within 100 miles of a border and present for less than two weeks. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's immigration enforcement strategy, though it is expected to be appealed.</p>

          <p>The FBI has recovered bones during a two-day search operation in Washington state for Travis Decker, a fugitive wanted for the murder of his three young daughters. The search, involving nearly 100 personnel, took place in dense vegetation near Rock Island Campground in Leavenworth. The bones are currently being analyzed to determine if they are human. Decker is the sole suspect in the killings of Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), whose bodies were discovered in his truck on June 2 after he failed to return them from a planned visitation.</p>

The roadway, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was severely impacted by rock slides and pavement collapses from storms in 2022 and 2023, followed by damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump earlier this year are illegal, stating they exceed the authority granted to the president under federal law. The ruling specifically targets tariffs justified by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including baseline tariffs on most countries and "reciprocal" tariffs on others. While the court upheld a lower court's finding of illegality, it paused an injunction that would have immediately blocked the tariffs to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision marks a significant legal challenge to a cornerstone of Trump's economic and trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Since 2023, live-fire military training exercises have been responsible for sparking hundreds of wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land in the UK, according to data obtained by the BBC. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, both from current drills and historical use, which can make areas too dangerous for crews to access. Of the 439 wildfires on MoD land since January 2023, 385 were directly caused by army maneuvers. While the MoD states it has policies to mitigate risks, some local residents are calling for a ban on live-fire training during the driest months.</p>

          <p>Pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens are now limiting access to the latest COVID-19 vaccines in certain states, requiring prescriptions or not offering them at all for some age groups. This change follows FDA approval of the new vaccines for all seniors but only for younger individuals with specific health conditions, ending the previous emergency use authorization. State laws in places like Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico prevent pharmacists from administering these vaccines without a prescription under the new guidelines. The move reflects the shifting regulatory landscape for COVID-19 immunizations as the U.S. transitions away from the public health emergency phase.</p>

After a slow start, his father's social media post about the stand caused it to become a local hit, with people lining up for a kind word. Ethan's simple act of kindness has been a heartwarming reminder of the power of positive reinforcement.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) is set to provide security for former Vice President Kamala Harris after President Trump revoked her federal Secret Service protection. Former vice presidents typically receive six months of protection after leaving office, but then-President Biden had signed an order extending Harris's detail until July 2026. Trump's reversal of this order has been criticized by California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, as a vindictive political act. The move comes as Harris is preparing to embark on a 15-stop international book tour.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson gave a measured response after California Governor Gavin Newsom suggested President Trump should deploy troops to Louisiana, Johnson's home state, due to its higher murder rate compared to California's. Speaking on Fox News, Johnson called Newsom an attention-seeker and stated that crime is an issue in cities across America that needs to be addressed everywhere. Newsom's comments were a direct retort to Trump's recent deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and his suggestions of doing the same in other Democratic-led cities like Chicago.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. following a week of turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that has led to calls for his resignation. The chaos began with the firing of CDC Chief Dr. Susan Monarez, which was followed by the resignation of at least three other senior leaders who reportedly objected to Kennedy's leadership and vaccine policies. Despite criticism from lawmakers and public health experts over his anti-vaccine history and recent funding cuts, a White House official described Kennedy as a "crown jewel" of the administration.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts in a bid to gain a partisan advantage for the GOP. This move makes Missouri the third state to engage in an unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, following similar actions in Texas and California. The proposed new map specifically targets the Kansas City-area district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. The special session, praised by former President Trump, is part of a national strategy by Republicans to solidify control of the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed it has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and undermine peace initiatives. The move, welcomed by Israel, is highly unusual as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. The ban comes as several countries, led by France, are planning to push for the recognition of a Palestinian state at the session.</p>

Planners suggest the event will be a major cultural moment, likely held at a private, meaningful location rather than a typical venue, with extreme measures taken to ensure confidentiality. Given Swift's history of being deeply involved in her creative projects, she is expected to take a hands-on approach to the planning. Fashion experts predict her gown will be romantic and refined, possibly from an international design house, reflecting her established red-carpet style.</p>

          <p>Major coffee chains like Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling to keep up with changing consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations who are drawn to trendier alternatives like matcha. Newer chains such as Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following through social media appeal and a diverse menu featuring colorful, non-traditional drinks. Analysts suggest that the rise of home coffee machines and a desire for unique, "treat" experiences have put pressure on mid-market brands. This market shift, combined with cost-of-living pressures, has led to reports that Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is exploring a potential sale of the chain.</p>

The incident has revived national concerns about the threat posed by anti-government conspiracy theorists.

Despite these complaints, Gardner was promoted by Qiao, whose gym has produced Olympic champions. An Olympic watchdog confirmed that Qiao and other coaches were privately sanctioned for failing to report the misconduct allegations, highlighting systemic failures to protect athletes even after the Larry Nassar scandal.</p>
