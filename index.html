        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The legal action stems from an article alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter in 2003 to the late Jeffrey Epstein, a claim the former president vehemently denies as false and malicious. The lawsuit names the company, its CEO, the publisher, and the two reporters involved, accusing them of significant journalistic failures and an attempt to link him to the disgraced financier. A spokesperson for Dow Jones expressed full confidence in their reporting and stated they will vigorously defend against the suit.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The incident, which occurred Friday morning, is believed to have happened while the deputies, members of the Arson Explosives Detail, were attempting to render safe a grenade recovered a day earlier. Sheriff Robert Luna described the event as the department's largest loss of life since 1857 and stated that a full investigation is underway to determine the exact cause. Federal agencies, including the ATF and FBI, are assisting local law enforcement in the investigation.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from severe injuries sustained after he was pulled into an MRI machine at a facility on Long Island, New York. According to police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against orders while his relative was undergoing a scan. The powerful magnetic force of the machine reportedly pulled the chain around his neck, drawing him into the device. Medical experts emphasize the strict safety protocols surrounding MRI machines due to their powerful magnets, which can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles. This incident highlights the catastrophic potential when such safety measures are not followed.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it will cancel “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in May of the following year, ending the host's decade-long run. The network cited financial reasons for the decision, stating it is not related to the show's content or performance. However, the timing, coming just days after Colbert criticized a settlement between parent company Paramount and Donald Trump, has led some U.S. senators to question the motive. Colbert, who took over the show in 2015, confirmed the news to his audience, who responded with disappointment to the end of the late-night institution, which has been a prominent platform for political commentary.</p>

The announcement follows a recent White House visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ongoing indirect talks mediated by Qatar. Trump has been vocal about his confidence in securing a ceasefire, stating that Israel had agreed to the necessary conditions for a deal earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for the U.S. stablecoin market.

The act allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move supporters believe will facilitate faster and lower-cost transactions. The administration and crypto advocates view this as a significant step toward integrating digital currency into the mainstream financial system, potentially revolutionizing financial technology.

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his physician, Dr. Sean P. Barbabella. The White House doctor described the condition as benign and common, especially in individuals over 70, and confirmed that tests found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins struggle to transport blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise.

The order requires medical professionals to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution. State attorneys had argued this was unlikely and that the inmate would be unconscious, but the judge's decision aims to prevent what Black's lawyers described as a potentially torturous outcome.

          <p>A 20-year-old man, Brycson Gaddis, has been charged with murder and assault in the death of his ex-girlfriend's 5-year-old son, Elyjiah Hearn. Prosecutors allege Gaddis beat the boy to death in a Panorama City apartment and left his body in a dumpster. The child was found with massive injuries, including a broken jaw and fractured ribs. Gaddis, who was not the boy's father, had a warrant for his arrest on an unrelated domestic violence charge at the time of the slaying. This horrific case has raised questions about why Gaddis was free despite his recent criminal history and failure to appear in court.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Stephen Colbert's Show Cancellation Signals Trouble for Late-Night TV</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' is raising questions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format in the modern media landscape. While CBS cited financial reasons, analysts point to broader industry pressures, including declining viewership, shrinking advertising revenue, and competition from online content. The topical, host-driven format struggles to compete in an on-demand streaming world where audiences prefer viral clips over full broadcasts. Colbert's show, a ratings leader, became a prominent voice of political criticism, but even its success could not overcome the economic challenges and shifting audience habits that threaten the entire genre.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists report that the UK is experiencing a significant increase in wasp populations this summer, likely due to a warm, dry spring creating ideal breeding conditions. While many people dislike the insects, experts emphasize their crucial role in the ecosystem as apex predators and natural pest controllers. The common wasp, while a nuisance at picnics, is one of thousands of species, most of which are solitary and harmless to humans. As sightings of both native and invasive hornet species also rise, the public is advised to remain calm and avoid agitating the insects to prevent stings.</p>

          <p>The popular cooking competition 'MasterChef' is in crisis after both of its long-time presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following an investigation into their conduct. An inquiry upheld over 40 claims against Wallace, including one of unwelcome physical contact. The investigation also substantiated a complaint that Torode used a severely offensive racist term on set. The BBC and production company Banijay have been navigating the fallout, which has reportedly strained the relationship between the two hosts. The future of the show, a major international brand, is now uncertain, though the BBC's director general insists the program is 'bigger than individuals' and will continue.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis delves into why the Jeffrey Epstein case has become a central issue for many in the MAGA movement, tying into long-running 'deep state' conspiracy theories. For years, some supporters have believed that powerful elites are being protected and that secret files could expose widespread corruption. The administration's recent handling of the Epstein files, initially dampening expectations of new revelations before reversing course, has fueled these beliefs. The article suggests the case is a proxy for broader anger and distrust in institutions, making it a difficult and volatile issue for President Trump to manage with his base, which expects him to uncover these supposed truths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, 'The Legend of Rooney's Ring,' reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by 'The Lord of the Rings.' Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom 'Motherland,' the spoof is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring. The show's creators insist it is an affectionate homage rather than a mean-spirited parody, celebrating the couple as heroic figures who have weathered public scrutiny. The play is characteristic of Liverpool's Royal Court theatre, which often stages original comedies with local relevance.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is extending its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunization program to include premature babies, who are highly vulnerable to the common and infectious virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to eligible infants born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine offered during pregnancy. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children, and this new injection offers approximately 80% protection with a single dose. Health officials stated the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and reduce pressure on hospitals by protecting some of the most at-risk children.</p>

          <p>A 2005 incident from Ethiopia is being recalled, where a 12-year-old girl, kidnapped and beaten by men attempting to force her into marriage, was rescued by a pride of lions. According to reports from the time, the girl had been missing for a week when the lions chased off her captors and then stood guard over her until she was found by police. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl’s whimpering may have sounded like a lion cub, which could explain why the pride protected her instead of attacking. The event was widely regarded as a miracle, highlighting the revered status of the endangered Ethiopian lion, the country's national symbol.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered an interaction between a specific gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that a molecule produced by certain bacteria overactivates an immune protein called STING, but a gene called OTUD3 normally acts as a brake. In individuals with a common variant of this gene, the brake fails, leading to chronic inflammation in the colon. This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments vary in effectiveness. It also opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that could target this specific pathway.</p>

Tom Michael, general manager of Boise State Public Radio, stated the cut represents 20% of his station's budget and will likely lead to a loss of staff and services.
