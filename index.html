          <p>A judge has found Apple in contempt, stating that the company willfully violated a 2021 injunction from the Epic Games case and that an Apple executive lied under oath. The judge accused Apple of trying to violate her ruling, which originally ordered Apple to allow developers to link to their websites within iPhone apps for purchases outside of Apple's ecosystem. Apple strongly disagrees with the decision and plans to appeal, but will comply with the court's order. The judge has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys to investigate potential criminal contempt proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may face a higher-than-expected tax bill on their profits, as the IRS considers gold and other precious metals 'collectibles.' This classification subjects long-term capital gains to a 28% top federal tax rate, higher than the 20% rate for stocks and real estate. Popular gold funds like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) are affected, as they are structured as trusts. Gold prices have soared recently, driven by concerns about a potential global trade war and economic recession, leading to significant profits for investors.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results, with U.S. same-store sales declining by 3.6%, the largest domestic drop since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, due to bad weather and cautious consumer spending. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted a decrease in traffic from low- and middle-income consumers, indicating broader economic pressures. To combat this, McDonald's plans to focus on value meals and popular menu items, including the return of snack wraps. Despite the domestic challenges, the company reiterated its full-year outlook, planning to open 2,200 locations and invest between $3 billion and $3.2 billion on capital expenditures.</p>

Experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines unethical because it would effectively deny a patient a known intervention while potentially exposing them to a dangerous disease.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is urging the Trump administration to implement a tariff exclusion process to prevent a recession and avoid irreparable harm to small businesses. In a letter to key trade officials, the chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, requested automatic tariff relief for small business importers and products not domestically available. She also asked for a quick process to obtain exclusions if tariffs pose significant risks to U.S. employment. However, a White House deputy chief of staff indicated the administration is not considering tariff exemptions.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors suggest a lesser-known 401(k) feature could significantly boost retirement savings through after-tax contributions and Roth conversions. While contribution limits exist, some plans allow after-tax 401(k) contributions beyond the standard deferral limits, enabling greater savings. Converting these after-tax funds to Roth accounts allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. However, many plans still don't offer this feature, and employee participation remains low, emphasizing the importance of understanding plan options and the conversion process.</p>
