          <p>A federal judge in Texas permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals. The judge ruled that the president's claims about a Venezuelan gang did not constitute an “invasion” as required by the act. The decision, limited to the Southern District of Texas, is the most expansive ruling against the White House's efforts to use the wartime law for immigration policy. The ruling could influence other cases involving the Alien Enemies Act, though the judge disclaimed authority to examine the truth of Mr. Trump’s underlying statements. Optimism score: 45</p>
