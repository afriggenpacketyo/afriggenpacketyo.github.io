        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year, which translates to an annual saving of Â£129 for a typical household. While this decrease is welcome news, charities emphasize that many individuals are still struggling with energy costs, owing approximately Â£4 billion to suppliers. The drop reflects a fall in international wholesale gas prices, but energy prices remain high overall, and further support is needed for vulnerable families. Standing charges continue to be a point of contention as well, as they add to the overall financial burden for consumers.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway awoke to find a 135-meter container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, narrowly missing his house. The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, NCL Salten, carrying 16 people, went off course in the Trondheim Fjord while traveling southwest to Orkanger. No injuries were reported, and Norwegian police are investigating the incident's cause. The head of NCL called it a "serious incident" and expressed gratitude that no one was injured, noting that the company is awaiting the results of the investigation by authorities. The ship had previously run aground in 2023 but was able to free itself.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating civil rights law by showing "deliberate indifference" to harassment against Jewish students. This accusation follows previous federal funding cuts to the university, totaling over $400 million. Columbia has stated it will continue to work with the government to combat antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination. The accusation is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to address antisemitism and ideological indoctrination in higher education, although university leaders fear government overreach and infringement on academic freedom. Students have protested at universities across the country since Israel's war in Gaza began in 2023.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to explore the possibility of a face-to-face meeting in June, coinciding with the Group of Seven summit in Canada. Both leaders are hopeful that upcoming ministerial-level tariff negotiations will be productive. Ishiba stressed the need for a "win-win" outcome in the bilateral relations through tariff discussions, and both parties concurred on the importance of enhanced cooperation, particularly in economic security. Japan continues to advocate for the United States to reconsider its tariff policy, including a 25 percent import duty on cars.</p>

          <p>BYD, a Chinese carmaker, outsold Tesla in Europe for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in April, marking the first time it has surpassed the market leader. Despite significant tariffs on cars imported from mainland China, BYD's BEV sales increased by 169% year-on-year, while Tesla's sales decreased by 49%. BEVs accounted for 17% of new car registrations in Europe in April, with Chinese firms contributing significantly to the growth. The shift indicates a growing presence and competitiveness of Chinese carmakers in the European electric vehicle market.</p>

This taunt feeds into age-old grievances and creates a climate where prejudice can be expressed more openly. The author warns that this rhetoric can erode confidence and exacerbate the feeling of impostor syndrome among successful women and minorities.

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was marked by Trump's focus on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide, overshadowing potential discussions on important bilateral issues. The meeting included a presentation of misleading information about land seizures and violence against white farmers, despite data indicating that violent crime affects all South Africans. The article argues that Trump's actions damaged America's standing and missed an opportunity for constructive dialogue. The encounter underscored the challenges of engaging with Trump's administration and its tendency to prioritize political theatrics over substantive diplomacy.</p>

However, a comprehensive review led to the restoration of certain courses, as FEMA recognized their effectiveness in training.
