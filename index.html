            <p>Ukraine reported a surge in Russian drone attacks across several regions immediately after the conclusion of a 30-hour Easter truce declared by Moscow, raising concerns about the fragility of ceasefire agreements. Air raid alerts were issued for key regions, including Kyiv, with reports of explosions in Mykolaiv. Both sides have accused each other of violating the truce, highlighting the ongoing tensions and challenges in achieving a lasting peace. US President Donald Trump expressed hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week, but provided no specifics.</p>

            <p>Police in Westchester County, New York, responded to a call about a llama on the loose, only to discover it was an alpaca that had escaped from a trailer near Hotel MTK. Officers successfully wrangled the alpaca, which had wandered over to Kisco Avenue, and returned it to its owner. The police humorously speculated that the alpaca might have been looking to upgrade its ride at a nearby Land Rover dealership. Alpacas are herd animals native to the Andes Mountains and are often used in petting zoos and for children's parties.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned other nations against yielding to U.S. pressure in trade negotiations, following reports that the U.S. intends to leverage tariff talks to impose trade restrictions on Beijing. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that "appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot earn one respect," urging countries to uphold international economic and trade rules. This warning comes as the Trump administration has imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures and escalating trade tensions between the two countries.

Taylor emphasizes that Europe can achieve these goals without forfeiting transatlantic partnerships and calls for decisive leadership to turn the Trump disaster into an opportunity for Europe.

            <p>Ingrid Lindblad, an LPGA rookie, secured her first tour victory at the JM Eagle LA Championship, held at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. The 25-year-old Swede held off the field with a final-round 68, ultimately winning after fellow rookie Akie Iwai missed a crucial putt on the 18th hole. Lindblad's win came in her third career tour start, marking a significant milestone in her professional career. The LA Championship moved to El Caballero in 2025 due to course renovations at Wilshire Country Club, where the LPGA tour plans to return next season.</p>

He also mentioned nearly 50 prisoners of other nationalities, including US citizens, as part of the proposed swap.</p>

The firm anticipates slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and higher inflation but sees the US narrowly avoiding a recession. JPMorgan recommends structured notes and hedge funds in diversified portfolios as strategies for investors to navigate the more volatile environment. These strategies aim to provide defensive exposure and generate income through options premiums, while also exploiting market mispricings. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports, leading China to impose a 125% tariff on US goods. With a new 737 MAX having a market value of around $55m, the tariffs could cripple a Chinese airline taking delivery.</p>
