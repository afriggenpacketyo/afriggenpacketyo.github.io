        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 pupils in England starting September 2026. This change will allow any child whose parents receive Universal Credit to qualify, regardless of their household income, saving parents £500 a year and potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated £1 billion to fund this initiative until 2029, alongside £13 million for food charities to combat food poverty by redistributing food from farms. While welcomed by the education sector and anti-poverty organizations, some critics argue that other measures, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more cost-effective in reducing child poverty. The government is expected to announce its decision on the two-child benefit cap in the autumn when it publishes its child poverty strategy. </p>

          <p>Army leaders are defending the decision to spend up to $45 million on a parade for the Army's 250th birthday celebration, arguing it will boost recruitment efforts. During a House Armed Services Committee meeting, officials stated that telling the Army's story through the parade would lead to a recruiting boom, despite having already met this year's recruitment goals. Congress members voiced concerns that the funds could be better allocated to improve troops' quality of life, particularly base housing, and also questioned the redirection of $1 billion from various accounts, including base housing, to support defense of the southern border. While some defended the parade as a display of patriotism, others worried about the impact of budget cuts on essential needs. </p>

          <p>A former National Security Agency analyst has raised concerns about Chinese-made solar panels used on American farms, suggesting they could pose a risk to the U.S. power grid. The concerns stem from the discovery of rogue communication devices inside Chinese solar power inverters, which could be used to disrupt U.S. commerce in the event of a conflict. These undocumented communication channels could potentially circumvent firewalls remotely, posing significant consequences. Chinese companies are legally obligated to assist China's intelligence agencies when needed, raising fears of potential cyberattacks against the United States.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of two American-Israeli hostages, Judy Weinstein-Hagi and Gadi Hagi, from the Khan Younis area of the southern Gaza Strip.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue efforts to return all abductees, both living and deceased, home.

          <p>Burundi is holding parliamentary elections with the ruling CNDD-FDD party widely expected to win due to the sidelining of the main opposition, the CNL. The CNL, which placed second in the 2020 election, was suspended in 2023, and its leader was ousted in a move allegedly orchestrated by the government. The country is grappling with a deep socio-economic crisis, including widespread shortages, soaring inflation, and rising public anger. Observers suggest that the election will likely reinforce the ruling party's grip on power as it faces mounting internal pressure over economic mismanagement and political repression.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached an agreement with the US Department of Justice to pay $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over the two 737 Max crashes that resulted in 346 deaths. The deal includes compensation for the victims' families and investments in safety improvements, but it has been criticized as insufficient by a lawyer representing some of the families. The lawyer argues that the agreement allows Boeing to evade true criminal accountability for the crashes, which were linked to faulty flight control systems. While Boeing has expressed deep sorrow and committed to changes, the settlement remains controversial among those seeking more severe penalties and prosecution of former company officials.</p>

The lawmakers from Te Pāti Māori, the Māori Party, performed the haka last November to oppose a bill they said would reverse Indigenous rights.

It is believed that the jabs can interfere with the absorption of the pill due to common side effects like vomiting and diarrhea, or because they slow the emptying of the stomach. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterwards before trying to become pregnant.

          <p>Water shows at the World Exposition in Osaka have been suspended through Friday after high levels of legionella bacteria were detected in seawater at the venue. The level of legionella detected in water from the Water Plaza was 20 times higher than the allowable limit under their guideline, prompting organizers to cancel shows. Resumption of the shows depends on the results of measures implemented to improve water quality, including sanitization, pipe cleaning, and increased circulation of seawater around the area. The Water Plaza, a large seawater reservoir, has also been experiencing issues with midges emerging from the area, raising concerns about possible health issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, noting differing attitudes towards women’s and transgender rights activism. Younger people are more likely to disagree with the supreme court ruling that the legal definition of “woman” in the Equality Act is based on biological sex. The progressive explanation attributes this age gap to progress, with younger people being more relaxed about sex and sexuality, and more committed to personal freedoms. However, the author argues that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist, and sees the emphasis on individual self-definition as congruent with consumer capitalism.</p>

          <p>Demand for low-cost e-commerce giants Temu and Shein has significantly slowed in the U.S. market due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the de minimis loophole. Temu's U.S. daily active users dropped 52% in May versus March, while those at rival Shein were down 25%, according to data from Sensor Tower. The user drop off comes as both Temu and Shein have pulled back on U.S. advertising spend over recent months since the Trump administration's tariff announcements. The Trump administration in April announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports, including the end of the "de minimis" tariff exemption on May 2, which allowed companies to ship low-cost goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. tariff-free.
