          <p>German authorities have banned the far-right "Kingdom of Germany" group, detaining its founder, Peter Fitzek, and three other suspected ringleaders. The group, part of the "Reich Citizens" movement, rejects the legitimacy of the modern German republic and seeks to establish a "counter-state" within Germany. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt accused the group of undermining the rule of law and using antisemitic conspiracy narratives to back up their claims to authority. The group reportedly has around 6,000 members who deny the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic and have been known to print their own passports and driver's licenses.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is blocking Department of Justice political nominations in protest of President Donald Trump's plan to accept a roughly $400 million luxury jet from Qatar. Schumer criticized the move as corrupt and a national security threat, demanding answers from the Trump administration and Justice Department. He called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress to explain why gifting Donald Trump a private jet does not violate the Emoluments Clause. While the nominations will likely move forward with Republican majority, Schumer's actions could slow down the process.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% annually in April, slightly below economists' expectations, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing costs were a significant driver of inflation, along with increased energy costs, despite lower gasoline prices. Grocery prices slightly declined, with egg prices dropping 12.7%, though remaining high due to bird flu outbreaks. Experts suggest that the tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S. may temper inflation's rise, potentially leading the Fed to cut rates twice in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter Coker Sr., an 82-year-old North Carolina businessman, was sentenced to six months in jail for his role in a scheme to artificially inflate the stock prices of Hometown International, a deli-owning corporation, and E-Waste.

The article notes that Tesla's car sales have declined partly due to consumer backlash against Musk's political activities, with profits hitting a four-year low. The stock sales occurred under a prearranged trading plan initiated after Musk endorsed Trump. Denholm continues to hold 85,000 shares and roughly 49,000 stock options, with a spokesperson defending her compensation as aligned with shareholder interests.</p>

The proposed revisions bring forward the deadline for candidates for December's presidential election, give Ben Sulayem the possibility to bar any candidate from running against him, and allow him more control over the membership of the FIA Senate. Critics suggest the changes aim at consolidating power and eliminating independent checks and balances, describing the document as "very cleverly written" to appear morally sound while potentially reducing transparency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria to give the country a chance at greatness. He cited the presence of a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace. Trump noted that his administration has already taken the first steps toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in more than a decade. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's consideration of accepting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from Qatar has sparked legal and ethical debate. Democrats claim the gift would be illegal, citing constitutional provisions against elected officials accepting gifts from foreign leaders without congressional approval. Experts suggest that the plane's intended use as a temporary Air Force One and subsequent transfer to Trump's presidential foundation may not circumvent these restrictions. The White House maintains that any donation will comply with the law.</p>

          <p>A temporary tariff reduction between the United States and China has eased trade tensions, lifting a de facto trade embargo and boosting stock prices. However, the article emphasizes that the deal does little to resolve the underlying uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy under President Trump, who has shown a pattern of unpredictable and reversible decisions. Economists warn that this uncertainty discourages companies from hiring and investing, limiting the potential benefits of the agreement. The 90-day pause is unlikely to prompt long-term commitments.</p>

          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, such as easing inflation and a steady job market, credit card debt forgiveness remains a viable option for many Americans struggling with high-interest balances. The article highlights that the cost of carrying credit card debt remains high, and debt forgiveness can offer targeted relief. It advises that debt forgiveness may be suitable for those whose debt feels unmanageable, are falling behind on payments, have access to a lump sum, or have exhausted other options like balance transfers. The article concludes that debt forgiveness can be a useful tool, but it comes with trade-offs like a hit to credit and potential tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>
