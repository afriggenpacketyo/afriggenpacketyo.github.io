          <p>The article discusses the persistent narrative surrounding President Biden's age and fitness for office, fueled by a new book detailing instances of his alleged cognitive decline. The author argues that while politicians often conceal their leaders' weaknesses, Biden's perceived infirmity is already evident to the public. The article highlights the futility of trying to cover up something so obvious, as Biden's public appearances consistently reinforce the perception of his age-related limitations. The piece concludes by acknowledging the ongoing nature of the Biden age story and its potential impact on his legacy. </p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials for broader use. This decision means that many healthy Americans may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to balance rapid access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence for those at average risk. This approach aligns with other developed countries that limit boosters to older adults and those with underlying conditions. </p>

          <p>Maryland lawmakers have introduced a bill to posthumously award Henrietta Lacks a Congressional Gold Medal for her contributions to medical research through her HeLa cells. Lacks' cells were taken without her consent and used in research that led to treatments for illnesses like polio and HIV/AIDS. The bill aims to honor Lacks and acknowledge the controversy surrounding informed consent in medical research. The Lacks family has also sued pharmaceutical companies for using HeLa cells without permission. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to admit Afrikaners from South Africa as refugees, leading to a clash with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine. Kaine questioned the prioritization of Afrikaners over other persecuted groups, while Rubio argued that the Afrikaners faced persecution due to racial land seizures. The exchange highlighted differing views on refugee prioritization and the application of persecution standards. Kaine also contrasted the refugee designation of Afrikaners with the absence of such a program for Black South Africans during apartheid. </p>
