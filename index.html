          <p>The Trump administration has faced criticism after deporting a two-year-old U.S. citizen and the mother of a one-year-old girl, with lawyers arguing that these individuals were given virtually no opportunity to speak with legal counsel or family members. A federal judge in Louisiana expressed concern that the two-year-old was deported “with no meaningful process,” deeming the action illegal and unconstitutional. The ACLU and other groups have condemned such actions as a shocking abuse of power. These incidents underscore ongoing clashes between the executive and judicial branches regarding immigration policy and due process. Optimism Score: 20</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, experienced a surprising drop in the 2025 NFL Draft, with teams passing on him in the first three rounds. ESPN's Pete Thamel attributed this decline to teams questioning Sanders' overall talent and athleticism, with concerns raised about his ability to throw in rhythm and his athleticism. While some analysts considered Sanders a top prospect, teams apparently did not see him as a first-round caliber player. This situation highlights the complexities of NFL draft evaluations, where factors beyond on-field statistics play a significant role. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Craig Moffett, a leading analyst, has cast doubt on Apple's reported plans to shift iPhone assembly to India, suggesting that the move may not effectively reduce costs associated with tariffs.
