          <p>Ford's vehicle sales increased by 14.2% in the second quarter of 2025, significantly exceeding the auto industry's projected growth of around 1.4%. This surge was driven by strong sales of its F-Series trucks, which had their best second quarter since 2019, and a notable rise in hybrid vehicle purchases. However, the report also highlighted a 31.4% drop in pure electric vehicle sales for the quarter, indicating a shift in consumer preference within its electrified vehicle category. The performance comes amid new tariffs on imported vehicles implemented by the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comparison of the House and Senate versions of the Republican's "big, beautiful bill" reveals different approaches to cutting Medicaid to offset tax reductions and new spending. The Senate version proposes deeper cuts over the next decade, totaling $930 billion compared to the House's nearly $800 billion. Both bills introduce new work requirements for recipients and stricter eligibility verification, though they differ on specifics like provider taxes and funding for Planned Parenthood. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these changes are projected to increase the number of uninsured Americans by nearly 12 million by 2034 under the Senate plan.</p>

          <p>Several Republican senators have responded with indifference to Elon Musk's public threat to support primary challenges against any GOP lawmaker who votes for President Trump's major spending bill. Senators including Roger Marshall and Tommy Tuberville stated they prioritize Trump's endorsement and legislative agenda over Musk's opposition. The article frames the conflict as part of a larger, ongoing feud between Musk and Trump, with lawmakers choosing to ignore the billionaire's warnings and focus on passing the bill. Musk's criticism centers on the bill's spending levels and cuts to green energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>President Trump, accompanied by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, visited a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The makeshift facility, located at a remote airport, is intended to house, process, and deport thousands of unauthorized immigrants. Administration officials have praised its isolation and natural security, while critics and protesters have condemned the site as a "callous political stunt." The facility's history as a failed 1960s jetport project and its funding through a FEMA program for migrant services add further context to the controversy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the Republican's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would financially harm the lowest-earning Americans while significantly benefiting the wealthiest. The report finds that cuts to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would cause the bottom 20% of households to lose income. Conversely, the top 20% would see their income rise due to the bill's tax cut extensions. These findings align with other nonpartisan analyses, including from the Congressional Budget Office, which also projected a regressive financial impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a record-breaking marathon session lasting over 26 hours, the U.S. Senate is approaching a final vote on President Trump's sweeping domestic policy package. The lengthy "vote-a-rama" involved dozens of amendments and intense, behind-the-scenes negotiations by Republican leadership to secure the support of skeptical party members. With leadership now expressing confidence that they have the necessary votes, the bill is expected to pass the Senate before returning to the House of Representatives for a final vote on the Senate's revisions. Vice President JD Vance was present at the Capitol, prepared to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed.</p>

Published in Frontiers in Psychology, the research found that foods like desserts, sweets, and dairy were most often blamed for worse sleep and disturbing dreams. In contrast, fruit and herbal tea were associated with better sleep. The authors theorize that the negative association with dairy might be due to gastrointestinal issues caused by lactose intolerance during sleep, rather than a direct neurological effect.</p>

His career was famously upended by two separate scandals involving prostitutes, which led to his defrocking by the Assemblies of God.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the largest single-month decline since February 2023. This drop is believed to reflect a weakening in buyer demand following recent changes to stamp duty thresholds, which increased the tax burden for many purchasers. While the annual price growth has slowed to 2.1%, some economists anticipate a market rebound in the coming months. They point to supportive factors such as low unemployment, earnings outpacing inflation, and the possibility of future interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. (not investment advice)</p>

Due to the current inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of about one year often offer higher rates than longer-term ones. To capitalize on these high short-term rates while planning for the future, the article suggests strategies like creating a CD ladder, where money is invested in multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates.

          <h2>Exploring Options for Medical Debt Relief, from Hospital Charity to Bankruptcy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 11:20:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With over 100 million Americans facing medical debt, this article outlines several potential avenues for relief. A primary option is hospital charity care, a requirement for nonprofit hospitals that can lead to forgiven or discounted bills for patients who meet specific income criteria. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement through a debt relief company can be a path to negotiate lower balances with creditors. As a final resort for overwhelming debt, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can provide comprehensive legal protection and a chance to eliminate or reorganize medical bills.</p>

They warn that the State Department lacks the infrastructure to manage the complex programs and that the dismantling of the agency will lead to increased global instability, famine, and a diminished American presence on the world stage.

By streamlining CEQA's requirements, the new law aims to accelerate development and address the state's severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis.
