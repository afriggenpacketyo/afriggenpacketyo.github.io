        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst military strikes in Iran, concerns are rising about the potential impact on global oil supplies and energy prices. Initial market reactions saw price fluctuations, with West Texas Intermediate crude initially jumping before declining. Experts believe a complete closure of the Strait of Hormuz is unlikely, but ongoing regional tensions pose a risk to energy markets, potentially driving prices higher if oil production facilities are targeted. Disruptions to oil flow through the Strait would severely impact countries like China, India, Japan, and South Korea, and a worst-case scenario could see prices spike to $130 per barrel, reducing global GDP by 0.8%.

          <p>The United Kingdom has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target expected to be agreed upon at a summit in the Netherlands. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas, providing EU countries with flexibility in meeting the target. The announcement has drawn criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who argues for immediate funding increases due to current geopolitical threats. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of economic security as national security, aiming to create jobs and growth for working people through this strategy.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has ordered David Walls-Kaufman to pay $500,000 to the widow and estate of Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, who died by suicide after the Capitol riot. The jury found Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting Smith during the riot, although a wrongful-death claim was dismissed by the judge. Erin Smith claimed that the assault caused psychological and physical trauma that led to her husband's suicide. Walls-Kaufman, who served a prison sentence for a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor and was later pardoned, denies assaulting Smith and calls the trial outcome "absolutely ridiculous."</p>

          <p>The Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. is considering designating Google with "strategic market status," potentially leading to changes in its online search services. This action comes under new competition rules granting the CMA expanded powers to enforce consumer protections on tech giants. Similar to the EU's Digital Markets Act, the legislation allows the CMA to take action, including imposing fines of up to 10% of global annual revenues for breaches. The CMA's consultation raises questions about Google's market power and its impact on competition within the U.K.</p>

          <p>A law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, simultaneously investigated allegations against San Jose State's transgender volleyball player, Blaire Fleming, and worked to protect her eligibility to compete.

The firm's efforts to maintain Fleming's eligibility were successful, and Heaphy later offered the school legal counsel to navigate a federal Title IX investigation, though the offer was declined.

          <p>A decline in deep reading, defined as sustained engagement with longform texts, is raising concerns about its impact on political discourse and societal values. Some analysts argue that the rise of digital media and social platforms is reverting society to an oral culture, characterized by less abstract thought and more tribalism. This shift may undermine the foundations of liberal democracy, which rely on abstract reasoning and impartial evaluation of claims. While acknowledging the potential harms, it's important to scrutinize such claims and avoid overestimating the impact of cultural marginalization.</p>

          <p>China has criticized the European Union's decision to exclude Chinese companies from public tenders for medical devices. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce expressed strong dissatisfaction and opposition to the ban, which is the latest in a series of trade disputes between Beijing and Brussels. China urges the EU to correct its wrongdoings and vows to take measures to protect the interests of Chinese enterprises. The EU's decision comes as both sides attempt to manage trade differences ahead of a planned summit.</p>

The U.S. recently conducted strikes targeting Iranian nuclear sites, leading to retaliatory strikes on U.S. bases, although Trump downplayed the severity of the Iranian response.</p>

Murphy believes that the Democratic Party can regain working-class support by calling out corporate villains and addressing economic anxieties. He has been influenced by thinkers like Patrick Deneen and commentators on the new right, leading him to question the free-market fundamentalism that has crept into the Democratic Party. This shift reflects a broader debate within the party about how to connect with working-class voters and challenge the Trump agenda.</p>

This pattern is evident in the public's negative reactions to his immigration policies, tariffs, and other decisions. This trend suggests that the public is reacting against Trump's actions and that a "thermostatic" model of public opinion is in play.</p>
