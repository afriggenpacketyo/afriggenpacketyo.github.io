          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual responsible for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities have recovered a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used in what they describe as a targeted attack from a nearby rooftop. While the suspect remains at large, investigators are analyzing forensic evidence and over 200 public tips in a round-the-clock effort to solve the case, which political leaders have condemned as a political assassination.</p>

          <p>A vessel suspected of drug trafficking, reportedly originating from Venezuela, was apparently turning back when it was destroyed by a U.S. military strike that killed eleven people. The Trump administration claims the boat was operated by the designated terrorist organization Tren de Aragua, a statement disputed by Venezuelan officials who say none of the deceased were gang members. The White House has defended the action as lawful and necessary to protect the country, while notifying Congress of the president's authority to conduct such operations in the interest of national security, suggesting further military action is possible.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted the collapse of Spirit Airlines, stating that the ultra-low-cost carrier's business model is fundamentally broken and unsustainable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby asserted that Spirit is destined to go out of business due to its financial struggles, weak customer demand, and a business model predicated on low base fares supplemented by numerous fees, which he claims customers dislike. Spirit Airlines, which recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year, has faced challenges from larger rivals like United introducing their own basic economy fares, making the discount market increasingly competitive.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old Los Angeles County man, Edwin Johnson, has been arrested and charged with the murder of his one-year-old daughter, Maeve Blakeley-Johnson. Authorities were called to a residence in the View Park area following a report of a child not breathing, where they discovered the toddler unresponsive inside a vehicle. The girl was pronounced dead at the scene, and Johnson was taken into custody.

Routh, who is representing himself, forfeited his opening statement after Judge Aileen Cannon determined his remarks about historical and global conflicts were irrelevant to the case. Prosecutors allege that Routh meticulously planned the attack with military-grade rifles, driven by a desire to prevent Trump from being reelected. The trial's first day included testimony from Secret Service agents and a civilian witness who followed Routh's vehicle after the incident.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk at an open-air event at Utah Valley University has prompted a close examination of the security protocols in place. The event was staffed by six university police officers and Kirk's private security team, but the suspect was able to fire a single, fatal shot from the roof of an adjacent building. Security experts suggest that the outdoor setting made traditional measures like bag checks and metal detectors impractical. They also noted that a comprehensive threat assessment should have considered Kirk's high profile and past threats, potentially necessitating additional measures like drone surveillance to monitor elevated positions.</p>

It highlights Trump's own history of rhetoric that has been seen as inciting or excusing violence, such as during the January 6th Capitol riot.

          <p>U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips has announced plans to lay off 20-25% of its workforce, a move that will impact thousands of employees. The decision comes as the oil industry grapples with falling crude prices, which have been affected by increased OPEC+ production and President Trump's ongoing trade wars. While experts anticipate an industry recovery by next year, the current downturn is forcing major companies to cut budgets and reduce drilling operations to maintain capital discipline. The layoffs highlight the volatility of the energy sector and the significant economic impact on workers and local communities tied to the industry.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Low Earning Potential of Traditional Savings Accounts in Current Rate Climate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the latest report showing U.S. inflation ticking up to 2.9% in August, savers are advised to reconsider keeping large sums in traditional savings accounts. Due to an average interest rate of just 0.39%, a $10,000 deposit in such an account would earn less than $40 over an entire year, failing to keep pace with inflation and effectively losing purchasing power. The article suggests that high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) offer significantly better returns in the current elevated interest rate environment. However, with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, savers should act quickly to lock in higher rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has abruptly withdrawn a state bill that would have significantly altered Measure ULA, the city's voter-approved tax on high-value property sales. The proposed legislation, pulled just before its first committee vote, aimed to reduce the tax burden on the sale of newly constructed commercial and apartment buildings to address a slowdown in housing production. The move faced strong opposition from the coalition that backed Measure ULA, who argued it would cut crucial funding for homelessness programs. Bass stated the bill was pulled for further amendments and will be reintroduced in January.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is urgently asking a federal appeals court to overturn a ruling that prevents President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The Justice Department wants the stay lifted before the Federal Open Market Committee's critical meeting next week, where a decision on lowering interest rates is expected. The administration argues the president has the authority to remove Cook "for cause" based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which a lower court found insufficient. The move is seen as part of the president's broader effort to exert more influence over the central bank's monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index report revealed that U.S. inflation rose to 2.9% in August, prompting renewed interest in gold as a protective investment. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation because it tends to hold its value, and often appreciates, when the purchasing power of fiat currency declines. With inflation remaining stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, this article suggests that dedicating a portion of one's portfolio to gold can buffer against economic uncertainty. However, it also cautions investors to remain disciplined, recommending that gold should typically constitute no more than 5-10% of a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship that he believes ultimately worked in his favor. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play, with witnesses reporting they saw two people run off with it. The suspected theft allowed Fitzpatrick to take a penalty drop instead of playing his provisional ball, a situation he estimates saved him at least one stroke. He finished the round with a six-under-par 66, two strokes behind the leaders.</p>

Uber has stated that it fundamentally disagrees with the allegations, citing its clear zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials and its community guidelines that prohibit discrimination.

After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift dramatically, with the U.S. receiving 90% and Japan receiving 10%.
