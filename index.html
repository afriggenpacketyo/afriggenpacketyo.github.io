          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 21:26:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has formally recognized a Palestinian state, with President Macron declaring at the UN that "the time for peace has come." This move is part of a growing trend among Western nations to recognize Palestinian statehood, aiming to advance a two-state solution amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The recognition comes as France and Saudi Arabia co-host a summit on the issue, though Israel and some G7 allies have condemned the step, arguing it rewards Hamas. France has indicated it will only open an embassy once all Israeli hostages are released and a ceasefire is in place.</p>

          <p>Operations at Copenhagen Airport have resumed after a nearly four-hour suspension caused by the sighting of several large, unidentified drones in the vicinity. The incident led to the diversion of at least 35 flights, and authorities have not yet determined the origin or type of the drones. Danish police have launched an investigation and will implement additional security measures, but they could not confirm or deny if the drones were of Russian origin. The airport has warned passengers to expect ongoing delays and cancellations following the disruption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following childbirth, many couples experience a significant decrease in sexual desire, a topic recently highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth. Experts explain that this decline in libido is common and stems from a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustments to parenthood for both partners. The article emphasizes that the six-week postnatal check-up is not a mandatory timeline for resuming intimacy and encourages open communication between partners to alleviate pressure. Addressing these changes honestly is crucial for navigating the relationship's evolution after welcoming a child.</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury has awarded $205 million to the family of a six-year-old girl who died after falling from the Haunted Mine Drop ride at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park in 2021. An investigation revealed that Wongel Estifanos was not properly secured because she was seated on top of already-buckled seat belts from a previous rider. Despite a warning alarm, an operator overrode the system and started the ride, leading to the fatal 110-foot plunge. The theme park has since permanently closed the attraction and stated it is exploring options to remain operational following the verdict.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Sacramento County is in custody after allegedly stealing his parents' pickup truck to drive to his former school. When deputies attempted to stop him, the boy led them on a brief chase through a residential neighborhood. The pursuit ended when the child crashed the truck into a patrol car and another parked vehicle. Fortunately, no injuries were reported from the incident, and authorities are now determining the next steps according to juvenile law, which holds children as young as 12 criminally responsible.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air after a nearly week-long suspension, stating the decision followed "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The suspension was enacted after Kimmel made jokes about the conservative reaction to the murder of influencer Charlie Kirk, which prompted threats from the FCC chairman and led major affiliate groups like Sinclair and Nexstar to drop the show. The network's initial decision sparked widespread criticism from free speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and civil liberties groups, who condemned it as censorship under government pressure.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reversed his decision to boycott an ABC town hall after the network reinstated Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had initially withdrawn from the event to protest Kimmel's suspension, which he framed as corporate cowardice in the face of authoritarian pressure from the Trump administration. He argued that the suspension sent a chilling message about free speech to all Americans, not just the host and his staff. His participation is now back on, highlighting the political fallout and the intense debate over free speech sparked by the network's actions.</p>

          <p>A USA Today opinion piece sharply criticizes President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F.

The author argues that their statements, which Trump admitted were based on his "opinion" rather than medical science, are a dangerous and irresponsible insult to science, mothers, and people with autism. The article condemns the administration for stoking fear, blaming mothers for their children's diagnoses, and creating a permission structure for people to doubt proven medical advice.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order labeling the anti-fascist movement known as antifa a "domestic terrorist organization," although the immediate legal authority and impact of this designation are unclear. The order directs federal agencies to investigate and disrupt alleged illegal activities by antifa members and their funders. The move follows the president's promise to take action after the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, though no link between his killer and antifa has been established. Legal experts note that the U.S. lacks a specific domestic terrorism statute, and antifa is a decentralized movement rather than a formal group.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, accelerating a push by federal health agencies to phase out research on live animals. This move is supported by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress, with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. leading the charge. While proponents celebrate the shift towards alternatives like AI modeling, some scientists and patient advocates express concern.

The author argues that if Kimmel softens his political humor out of fear, it will send a chilling message that self-censorship is the appropriate response to intimidation from the Trump administration. The article posits that humor is a powerful tool for building camaraderie and draining away fear, which is why autocratic figures historically target comedians. It concludes by urging Kimmel not to back down, framing his comedic critique of power as a patriotic duty.</p>

          <h2>Report: Trump Administration Ended Bribery Investigation into 'Border Czar' Tom Homan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration reportedly closed a federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, the president's "border czar," earlier this year. The investigation was initiated after Homan was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen, in exchange for promises of help in securing government contracts. At the time of the alleged incident, Homan was a private citizen but had publicly discussed his prominent role in a potential second Trump term. The White House has denied Homan accepted the money and characterized the investigation as politically motivated entrapment by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Viviane Barci de Moraes, the wife of the Brazilian Supreme Court justice who presided over the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro. The sanctions were issued under the Global Magnitsky Act, which targets human rights abusers, with the U.S. State Department accusing Justice Alexandre de Moraes of weaponizing the courts and suppressing free expression. This action is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration against Brazil, including revoking the visa of its Solicitor-General. Justice de Moraes condemned the sanctions as an attack on Brazil's sovereignty.</p>

          <h2>An Examination of the Limited Evidence Behind Claims Linking Tylenol to Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's announcement urging pregnant people to avoid Tylenol due to a supposed link with autism is based on highly contentious and limited scientific evidence. While some small, observational studies have suggested an association, they cannot prove causation and struggle to account for confounding factors like genetics or the underlying reason for the medication's use. The largest and most rigorous study on the topic, involving 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no such link. Most autism scientists attribute the rise in diagnoses to increased awareness and a broader definition of the condition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas has created significant confusion, according to immigration attorneys. While the White House clarified the fee applies only to new applications, lawyers are advising clients with existing visas to avoid international travel until further guidance is issued. They are concerned that current visa holders who need to file for extensions or employer changes could be unexpectedly subjected to the fee upon re-entry. Attorneys predict the high cost will have a "chilling effect" on the program, deterring companies in tech and healthcare from hiring skilled foreign workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Introduces 'Gold Card' Program for Wealthy Immigrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:09:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway, the "Trump Gold Card," which offers a fast track to permanent residency for wealthy foreigners. In exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce," applicants can receive an employment-based visa, a category historically reserved for individuals with "extraordinary ability." Unlike the existing EB-5 investor visa program, which requires investment in American businesses, the Gold Card funds will be used more broadly to "promote commerce" or pay down national debt. The program signals a shift in immigration policy, valuing personal wealth. (not investment advice)</p>
