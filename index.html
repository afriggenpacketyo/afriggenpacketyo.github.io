        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prince Andrew's business dealings are facing increased scrutiny after it was revealed that his firm, Pitch@Palace Global, was administered by a company controlled by Doug Barrowman, a controversial millionaire. This connection raises concerns due to Barrowman and his wife's involvement in a scandal involving large government contracts during the Covid pandemic. The arrangement, where legal ownership was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK), occurred after Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview in 2019. Critics are calling for a full investigation into the prince's financial activities, given his history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have secured a surprising victory in Canada's federal election, largely fueled by a backlash against Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Carney successfully framed the election as a referendum on Canada's sovereignty and economic survival against Trump's threats. The Conservatives made gains but fell short, while the left-wing New Democrats collapsed, paving the way for a Liberal victory. Carney, a political newcomer, capitalized on anxieties about Canada's economic future and Trump's actions, ultimately leading his party to an unexpected win.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asian countries are being cautioned to carefully consider the risks of aligning too closely with the United States in the ongoing trade war with China. A Chinese political scientist warned that such alignment could lead to isolation by China and hinder growth prospects. Supporting ASEAN's re-industrialization efforts is not the primary goal of the U.S., whereas China is better positioned to assist the region in achieving its goals. The warning highlights the complex geopolitical and economic considerations facing ASEAN member states.</p>
