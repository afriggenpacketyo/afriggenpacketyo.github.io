          <p>As the United States initiates public consultations for the 2026 review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Asian economies should actively participate to protect their interests. Trade and investment flows from Asia to North America have significantly increased in recent years, with Asian exports reaching $1.7 trillion in 2024. Foreign direct investment from Asia to Mexico has more than tripled between 2019 and 2024, driven by the desire to leverage USMCA tariff preferences.
