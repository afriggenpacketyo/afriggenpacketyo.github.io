          <p>Amazon's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, fueled by growth in cloud computing and advertising. The article reports that the company's earnings per share were $1.59 against an estimated $1.36, and revenue reached $155.67 billion, exceeding the projected $155.04 billion. However, Amazon's guidance for the second quarter anticipates sales between $159 billion and $164 billion, which is slightly below analysts' expectations of $160.9 billion, causing the stock to dip slightly in extended trading. The company's outlook also forecasts operating income between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, falling short of the consensus forecast of $17.64 billion.</p>

          <p>Amazon's advertising business experienced substantial growth in the first quarter, with revenue increasing by 19% to $13.92 billion, exceeding analyst estimates of $13.74 billion. The article notes that this growth underscores the increasing importance of Amazon's advertising platform in the digital advertising market. Despite representing a smaller portion of Amazon's overall sales, its ad business has emerged as the third-largest platform globally, trailing only Alphabet and Meta. Investors are particularly focused on online advertising due to economic uncertainties and trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which could impact Amazon's core retail operations and its ad unit.</p>

          <p>Airbnb's first-quarter results were largely in line with expectations; however, the company issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the second quarter, causing shares to decline. The article indicates that Airbnb expects revenue between $2.99 billion and $3.05 billion, which is below the $3.04 billion analysts had predicted. The company attributed the softer outlook to broader economic uncertainties, particularly in the U.S. market. Despite strong year-over-year growth in North America, Airbnb reported softness in travel from Canada to the U.S., and the company also teased upcoming updates to its app that will expand its offerings beyond just accommodations.</p>

The HHS official cited a poor safety culture as the cause of the incidents. During the pause, all research will cease, and access will be limited to essential personnel while HHS works to correct the safety culture at the facility, with the facility's director being placed on administrative leave.</p>

CVS's insurer, Aetna, showed signs of improvement, with the medical benefit ratio decreasing to 87.3% from 90.4% a year earlier, reflecting stronger performance in its Medicare business.

The article reports that Mounjaro's revenue reached $3.84 billion, up 113% year-over-year, while Zepbound generated $2.31 billion in sales. However, Eli Lilly lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to a recent cancer treatment deal with Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion, which reflects existing tariffs as of May 1 but excludes planned levies on pharmaceuticals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, under the direction of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, plans to require placebo-controlled studies for all new vaccines before they can be made available. The article explains that this move has sparked alarm among vaccine experts, who fear it will undermine confidence in and availability of vaccines. Kennedy's office maintains that this new requirement is aimed at ensuring vaccine safety, but experts argue that key vaccines were already tested against a placebo. This change in standard could significantly delay the availability of future COVID-19 shots and other updated vaccines.</p>

Armed Sunni Muslim extremist groups then attacked areas with large Druse populations, leading to clashes and the spread of violence to Sweida, a Druse-controlled region. The bloodshed has raised concerns that Syria, already vulnerable since the overthrow of the Assad dictatorship, may further fracture along sectarian lines.</p>

          <p>European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said Brussels is prepared to increase purchases of goods from the United States by 50 billion euros to address a "problem" in the trade relationship. The article explains that Sefcovic suggested the bloc would not accept Washington keeping in place 10% tariffs on its goods as a fair resolution to trade talks. The EU is also willing to collaborate with the U.S. to address the impact of China’s export surge as a sweetener for a trade deal. Sefcovic cautioned that reaching a deal that is clearly good and acceptable for EU member states and the European parliament would be very difficult.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans it deems criminals from the Southern District of Texas. The article explains that Judge Rodriguez ruled the White House's use of the statute was illegal, as the president's claims about a Venezuelan gang do not constitute an 'invasion'. The judge's decision, limited to the Southern District of Texas, challenges the White House's attempts to transpose the 1798 law into modern-day immigration policy. The ACLU praised the ruling, stating that the president cannot simply declare an invasion and invoke a wartime authority during peacetime.</p>
