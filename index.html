          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba announced that Japan will stress the importance of free trade in upcoming tariff negotiations with the United States, despite President Trump's protectionist policies. Ishiba plans to highlight Japan's investment contributions to the U.S. during discussions aimed at addressing trade imbalances. Additionally, none of Ishiba's cabinet members visited the Yasukuni Shrine during the spring festival, partially due to diplomatic considerations, though Ishiba sent a ritual offering, drawing protests from China and disappointment from South Korea who view the shrine as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The expo in Osaka has drawn 1 million visitors in 11 days since opening.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand has plunged nearly 13% as interest rates climb to a two-month high, fueled by economic uncertainty. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.90%, impacting refinance and purchase applications. Refinance applications dropped 20%, while purchase applications fell 7%, with rising home prices and stock market volatility adding to the challenges for homebuyers.

          <p>The price of gold has increased rapidly since President Trump imposed tariffs, briefly reaching a record high of over $3,500 per ounce. Uncertainty and projected losses from tariffs have caused the stock market to decline, leading investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold. The value of the U.S. dollar has also fallen, further increasing the appeal of gold as a stable investment. Goldman Sachs projects that gold prices will continue to rise, potentially reaching $3,700 by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration lacks the authority to set states' athletic gender eligibility policies.

          <p>Congressional lawmakers have condemned the detention of Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, students being held by US immigration authorities for their pro-Palestinian activism. During a visit to the detention facilities in Louisiana, lawmakers described the students' treatment as a “national disgrace.” The delegation stated that the students have not been accused of any criminal conduct and are being held in violation of their constitutional rights. They also reported that those in custody were visibly upset, afraid, and not receiving necessary healthcare.</p>

McIlroy is returning to the scene of a disappointing major result where he missed the halfway cut in 2019. Schauffele, who will return the Claret Jug, hopes to fly under the radar and take advantage of the heightened attention on McIlroy. He anticipates challenging weather conditions during the championship.</p>

          <p>A growing divide between "cradle" Catholics and Orthodox Christians versus recent converts is impacting American politics, as converts bring politicized views into previously culturally-bound communities. The trend, fueled by online communities, involves young men seeking community and answers in traditional religion, often disillusioned with modernity and embracing conservative views. This is leading to conflicts within churches and accelerating political polarization, with converts challenging established hierarchies and traditions. This trend is evident in figures like Vice President JD Vance, whose views clash with traditional Catholic teachings.</p>

          <p>The 'Star Wars' franchise's focus on chosen ones and inherited destinies may have inadvertently promoted the wrong ideas about rebellion. While the original film emphasized egalitarianism, later installments leaned heavily on the trope of special individuals destined to save the galaxy. This shift diminishes the importance of ordinary rebels and their collective efforts. The author argues that the series' most relatable moments are those that highlight the characters' failures and complexities.</p>

          <h2>There's No Neutral Language to Describe Horrific Actions</h2>

          <p>Language is not neutral, and attempts to manufacture neutrality in language result in the opposite effect. If something horrific is happening, describing it with euphemisms becomes an endorsement of the horror itself. Attempts to avoid biased terms for controversial topics result in their own bias. It is impossible to describe controversial and high-stakes circumstances without also implicitly weighing in on them.</p>

          <p>The Los Feliz Albertsons' unofficial Instagram page has thousands of followers, including celebrities. The meme-based fan account connects the neighborhood through humor and shared experiences. The creators, Joel Dauten, Amanda Markell, Michael Tapia and Kevin Horst, met as undergrads at Arizona State University in the 2000s. They operate the account as a practical joke that morphed into a meme-based fan account, which then transformed into a digital neighborhood hangout.</p>
