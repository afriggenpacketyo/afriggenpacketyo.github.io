          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that certain humanities majors, such as nutrition, art history, and philosophy, are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects for recent college graduates. The article highlights that while computer science and engineering graduates face higher unemployment rates, graduates with degrees in art history and nutritional sciences are experiencing lower rates. BlackRock's COO noted the increasing need for individuals with backgrounds in history and English, signaling a shift in hiring strategies driven by the rise of artificial intelligence and the demand for creative thinking. The healthcare sector also shows resilience, with high demand for nursing majors due to the ongoing need for healthcare professionals (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article reports that while Republicans promote their tax plan as beneficial for hard-working Americans, analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that many individuals earning less than $51,000 annually could see a decrease in after-tax income starting in 2026 due to proposed spending cuts in federal programs like Medicaid and food stamps. The analysis indicates that the top 0.1 percent, those with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain significantly, while those making between $51,000 and $17,000 could lose around $700, and those below $17,000 could lose nearly $1,000. Republicans argue the plan will spur economic growth and job creation, but critics contend that the benefits disproportionately favor higher-income individuals.</p>

          <p>A prison governor, Kerri Pegg, has been sentenced to nine years in jail for having a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, a drug-dealing gang boss. Pegg, considered a "rising star" in the Prison Service, helped Saunderson secure day release and received gifts from him, including a Mercedes car funded by drug money. Detectives found she was living beyond her means, buying designer jewellery and clothes including Jimmy Choo shoes and Chanel necklaces. The judge stated that Pegg had betrayed public trust and was "catastrophically compromised" due to undeclared County Court Judgements, making her vulnerable to corruption and blackmail.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, causing a complete shutdown of train service and impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from disagreements over pay raises, with the union asserting they haven't received a raise in five years, while NJ Transit claims the union rejected a deal offering $49.82 per hour. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including enhanced bus service on 19 routes, but acknowledges it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. The agency is cross-honoring rail tickets on bus and light rail lines, while encouraging commuters to work from home or use alternative services like Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, light rail, or ferries.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk will replace its chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, citing a significant decline in its stock price attributed to growing competition in the weight-loss drug market. The Danish drugmaker, facing challenges from lower-cost copycat versions and competition from Eli Lilly, has seen its stock price fall by 50 percent in the past year. The company's success with Ozempic and Wegovy had previously prompted Denmark's central bank to keep interest rates lower, but investors have grown wary. The market for weight-loss drugs is expected to change in the coming years as Eli Lilly develops new weight-loss drugs, while Novo Nordisk faces the potential for generic versions of its drugs in some countries.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting and deleting an Instagram photo interpreted as a threat against President Trump. The image showed seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," which some interpreted as a call to "eighty-six" or remove the 47th president. Comey has denied the post was intended as a threat, stating he was unaware of the association with violence and removed the image. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel have stated the issue is under investigation, with the Secret Service taking primary jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen to near-record lows as concerns rise over the impact of tariffs on inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey. The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8, the second-lowest on record, with year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 7.3%. The majority of the survey was completed before the U.S. and China announced a pause on most tariffs. Economists generally agree that tariffs could lead to a short-term rise in prices, but the extent of the increase and its impact on long-term inflation remains unclear.</p>

The term has various etymologies, including origins in Prohibition-era bars and U.S. Navy logistical coding systems.
