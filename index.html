          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order introducing a significant $100,000 annual fee for H-1B skilled foreign worker visa applicants, effective September 21. This measure, aimed at curbing alleged program abuse, requires companies to pay this amount per applicant for six years. While critics, including small businesses, fear it will price out many and harm American competitiveness, supporters argue it prioritizes American workers. The order also introduces a "gold card" visa for a $1 million fee, reflecting a broader shift in U.S. immigration policy towards stricter controls and higher financial barriers for foreign talent.</p>

          <p>Russia is hosting the final of its relaunched Intervision song contest, presented by President Vladimir Putin as a conservative counterpoint to the Western-oriented Eurovision. This move follows Russia's ban from Eurovision after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The competition, which emphasizes "national identity" and "traditional values," includes participants from former Soviet republics and BRICS partners like Brazil, China, and India. With a 30 million rouble cash prize, organizers hope to attract over a billion TV viewers, highlighting a geopolitical and cultural divide.</p>

          <p>A British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and are returning to the UK. Their son expressed immense gratitude for their release, which followed Qatar-brokered negotiations. The Taliban claimed the couple broke Afghan laws but never disclosed specific reasons for their detention. Despite their ordeal, the couple, who lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades running a charitable program, expressed a desire to return, highlighting their deep affection for the country and its people.</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested urgent consultations with NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes. Italian, Finnish, and Swedish jets were scrambled in response, with NATO calling it "reckless Russian behaviour." Russia denies the violation, claiming its jets flew over neutral waters. This incident, the fifth such violation by Russia this year, has escalated tensions, particularly after similar incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, prompting Estonia to seek a united and strong alliance response to ensure shared situational awareness.</p>

France, despite losing their last 16 encounters against England, remains the only team to have come within seven points during this streak, showing resilience. France's coaches acknowledge the daunting statistics but emphasize that every game is different, especially in a World Cup semi-final. Despite recent setbacks to their squad, France hopes to pull off a significant upset and secure their first Women's Rugby World Cup final appearance.</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, a principal executive of China-based Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a U.S. prison for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals. Wang and his marketing manager, Yiyi Chen, were convicted of fentanyl precursor importation and money laundering. The U.S. Justice Department stated that Amarvel Biotech acted as a "pipeline of poison," shipping hundreds of kilos of these chemicals disguised as everyday goods. This conviction marks a significant step in U.S. efforts to combat the fentanyl crisis by targeting China-based suppliers, a move that has previously drawn strong condemnation from Beijing.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation uncovered widespread issues of counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's online marketplace, impacting consumer trust and safety. Shoppers reported receiving fake health supplements and luxury beauty products from sellers impersonating legitimate businesses, including a pizza parlor. The article reveals that Walmart eased its seller vetting processes to compete with Amazon, leading to a surge in sellers but also increased risks. While Walmart states a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited items, the findings suggest a "Wild West" environment, prompting the company to recently tighten vetting for health and beauty categories. This highlights the challenges of policing vast online marketplaces.</p>
