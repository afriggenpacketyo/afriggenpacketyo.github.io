          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to companies taking short-term measures like pre-ordering inventory, absorbing costs, and using loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts warn that this stability is likely temporary and expect consumer prices to rise in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece concludes that the ruling represents a stunning and tragic limitation on the power of courts to enforce the Constitution.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace deal in Washington, D.C., aimed at ending decades of conflict and disarming armed groups in eastern DR Congo. The deal was hailed by U.S. and Congolese leaders as a major diplomatic breakthrough that could bring stability to the volatile region. However, specific details of the agreement remain scarce, and observers are cautious, given that several previous peace deals have ultimately failed.</p>

          <p>This analysis from The Economist suggests that New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, while labeled by some as Trump's "worst nightmare," could paradoxically benefit the former president. His avowed democratic socialist platform and hyper-progressive stances may serve to energize the Republican base and alienate moderate voters. The article notes his grassroots campaign style is reminiscent of former mayor Ed Koch, suggesting he could be a formidable but polarizing figure.</p>
