          <p>Bitcoin experienced a surge, rising for a third consecutive day to approach $95,000, fueled by a broad market rally. This positive movement was partly attributed to President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and less aggressive rhetoric towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency has recovered approximately half of its losses since Inauguration Day, signaling renewed investor confidence. Market strategists suggest that investors are capitalizing on a dip in Bitcoin, viewing it as a compelling option for portfolio diversification and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.

The exchanges occurred during Prime Minister's Questions, with Badenoch pressing Starmer on whether he would apologize to a former MP who left the Labour party.

          <p>The anti-abortion movement is increasingly embracing the concept of fetal personhood, with lawmakers introducing legislation that could charge women who have abortions with homicide. This shift is driven by a conviction that fetuses deserve legal rights and protections, potentially leading to conflicts between fetal rights and women's rights. The movement's alliance with the Republican party and its focus on punishing wrongdoers have contributed to this more punitive approach. While such extreme measures are unpopular, the movement's reliance on courts rather than voters allows it to pursue these goals despite public opposition.</p>

          <p>The stock market saw a substantial rise as news emerged of a possible de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war and President Trump's reassurance that Jerome Powell would remain Federal Reserve Chair. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared over 1,000 points, and other major indexes also experienced significant gains. Analysts cautioned that the market's durability depends on the consistency of Trump's rhetoric. The International Monetary Fund had previously issued a gloomy report citing the trade war as a factor in slowing global economic growth, making the potential tariff relief welcome news for investors.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that undocumented migrants should not be entitled to trials to challenge their deportation, citing the impracticality of providing trials for thousands of people. He emphasized the need to remove "bad people," including criminals and the mentally ill. The comments followed a Supreme Court decision temporarily blocking the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. Trump's administration has faced criticism for allegedly violating due process rights in deportation cases, including the case of a migrant erroneously deported to El Salvador.</p>
