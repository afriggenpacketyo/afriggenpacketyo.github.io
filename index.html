          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a significant drop following a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump, with Trump suggesting the federal government could withdraw contracts from Musk's companies.

This limitation raises concerns about the bill's effectiveness in supporting the most vulnerable families. The findings highlight the potential for unintended consequences in tax policy.</p>
