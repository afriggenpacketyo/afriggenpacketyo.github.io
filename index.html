        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Russell 2000, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, officially entered a bear market, declining over 20% from its November high.  This downturn is attributed to a softening economy impacting company profits and increased interest payments on debt for small-cap companies.  The situation is exacerbated by President Trump's tariffs, which disproportionately affect smaller businesses with less financial flexibility and increased import costs.  Experts express concern about the potential for a deeper recession.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are expected to increase prices for cannabis products in the U.S. due to reliance on Asian manufacturing for many items.  The added tariffs will impact companies' margins and potentially drive consumers towards the illicit market.  Shares of cannabis companies fell following the tariff announcement.  The increased costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, further impacting an already challenging market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's tariff calculation methodology has come under scrutiny.  Analysts suggest a formula based on dividing the trade deficit by imports from each country. This approach differs from conventional tariff calculations and raises questions about its accuracy and fairness.  The methodology disproportionately affects countries with larger trade deficits with the U.S. The lack of transparency and independent verification of the data used further fuels concerns.</p>
