          <h2>Israeli Reservists Voice Opposition to Gaza War Amid Growing Pressure on Netanyahu</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 01:07:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of Israeli reservists, including former Mossad head Danny Yatom, have signed letters urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to end the Gaza war and prioritize a hostage deal with Hamas. These reservists, some of whom were involved in pre-war anti-government protests, express concern that Netanyahu is prioritizing his own political interests over national interests and the lives of the hostages. The reservists highlight a drop in reserve attendance, signaling a looming crisis for the military. Critics argue the war's continuation undermines Israel's claim of being a moral army, with some suggesting soldiers should consider disobeying orders to avoid war crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at Glasgow University have confirmed the increasing presence of mosquitoes in Scotland, with sightings as far north as Shetland. Over 20 different species of the biting insect have been identified, thanks to a citizen science project that collected over 700 reports and photos from the public. Researchers initially suspected midges or clegs were responsible for nuisance biting, but analysis revealed swarms of mosquitoes actively biting people. The insects are commonly found in woodland areas and stagnant water, and the project has helped identify key habitats and mosquito species across Scotland.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk argue that the U.S. military lacks the personnel and equipment needed to fight a major war. They contend that the focus on high-tech weaponry has come at the expense of quantity, leaving the military brittle and unprepared for prolonged conflicts. The authors point to the war in Ukraine, Israeli battles, and operations against the Houthis as examples of modern warfare's demands, highlighting shortages in artillery shells, precision-guided missiles, and recruits. They advocate for increased investment in ammunition, ships, aircraft, and improved living conditions for service members to bolster military readiness.</p>

According to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, the woman reported that Gipson attacked her at her residence, bound and gagged her, and threatened to kill her. He then allegedly sexually assaulted her, beat her with a handgun and a blunt object, and transported her to his residence before confining her in a container.

          <p>The Trump administration announced an agreement with Ukraine to share future revenues from the country's mineral reserves, creating a joint investment fund. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the deal signals a commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine, while also addressing Trump's concerns about providing Kyiv with a "blank check." The agreement aims to give Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's fate and prevent those who financed Russia's war from benefiting from Ukraine's reconstruction. While details remain unclear, Ukrainian officials say they will retain control over their resources and profits will be reinvested in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed an agreement to share profits from the sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, which Trump has framed as an economic incentive for the US to continue investing in Ukraine's defense. The deal establishes a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that will begin to repay the aid provided to Ukraine since the start of the war. Ukrainian officials have described the agreement as equitable, allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources. Critics had previously voiced concerns that the White House was seeking to exploit Ukraine by linking aid to the nation to a giveaway of its resources, but the final terms were less onerous for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of trade policies on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The BOJ now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a significant decrease from the previous forecast of 1.1 percent. This decision comes as President Trump's tariffs weigh heavily on Japan's economy, with new taxes on imports and potentially higher levies threatening to cause a national crisis. The BOJ's decision to keep interest rates steady underscores the challenges of reverting to conventional monetary policies amid tariff-induced economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reflects on the changing dynamics in Asia, noting a shift from American influence to a growing Chinese presence. The author contrasts the past, when the U.S. was seen as a beacon of hope and democracy, with the present, where President Trump's policies have led to a perceived withdrawal from aid and democratic ideals. While American ideals still resonate, China's economic and military power is increasingly felt across the region. The article suggests that Asia is learning to live with a new great power, even as some express concern about China's intentions and a desire for continued American engagement.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns over the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the country's economic outlook. While Japan has experienced inflation above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 months, offering room to raise rates, the central bank highlighted that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The BOJ signaled it would continue to raise its policy rate if economic and price forecasts are realized.</p>
