          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted worksite enforcement operations across the Washington, D.C. area, visiting over 100 businesses to ensure compliance with U.S. immigration and employment laws. According to ABC News, no arrests were made during these operations, which involved distributing information and requesting I-9 forms from businesses to verify employee identities and employment authorizations. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern over the actions, noting that ICE appeared to be targeting neighborhoods and disrupting local businesses, while the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington voiced worries about the potential impact on the local economy due to the significant role immigrants play in the restaurant workforce.</p>

          <p>Japan strongly condemned North Korea's recent launch of multiple short-range ballistic missiles, asserting that such actions pose a significant threat to regional peace and stability. According to Kyodo News, the missiles were fired from the Wonsan area and traveled approximately 800 kilometers before landing in the Sea of Japan. Japanese officials have stated that no missiles breached Japan's exclusive economic zone, but the launches are still considered unacceptable. This event follows North Korea's previous missile launch in March, which occurred shortly after South Korea and the United States began joint military exercises.</p>

          <p>Apple is requesting a court to pause a recent contempt ruling in its case against Epic Games, arguing that complying with the order could cost the company substantial sums. According to CNBC, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple in violation of her original court order by continuing to charge commissions on in-app transactions that link out for payment. Apple claims the required changes would negatively impact its business by reducing consumer choice and impeding in-app purchases. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney celebrated the ruling as forcing Apple to compete, but Apple contends the order is punitive and plans to appeal the contempt ruling.</p>

          <p>India said it carried out strikes on Pakistan in retaliation for a terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians in Kashmir last month, with the Indian government claiming its forces struck nine sites in Pakistan and on Pakistan’s side of the disputed Kashmir region. The New York Times reports that Pakistani military officials said more than 20 people had been killed and dozens injured after six places were hit on the Pakistani side of Kashmir and in Punjab Province. The action follows a deadly attack in Kashmir on April 22, and has heightened tensions between the two nations, both of which claim the disputed region.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the South China Morning Post argues that the West is at an inflection point, and US President Donald Trump’s policies and rhetoric are accelerating the unravelling of the Western world order. The author draws parallels to historical examples of empires undone by their leaders’ hubris, short-sightedness, or divisiveness, such as Diocletian's reforms in the Roman Empire. Trump's tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, denial of facts, embrace of nationalism, and undermining of democratic norms are cited as factors contributing to a loss of faith in the Western project.</p>
