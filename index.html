        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taliban administration in Afghanistan has enacted a complete shutdown of internet and telecommunication services across the country. This move follows weeks of progressively severing fibre-optic connections, leading to what internet watchdog Netblocks describes as a "total internet blackout." The disruption has impacted international news agencies, mobile internet, and satellite TV, with flights from Kabul also being canceled. While the Taliban have not provided an official reason, the blackout is expected to severely affect banking, e-commerce, and daily life for citizens who rely on the internet for business and education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to maintain its benchmark policy rate at 3.6%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as the country grapples with its highest inflation rate in over a year, with recent data suggesting price pressures may be more persistent than previously expected. The RBA has already cut rates by 75 basis points this year to combat inflation, which reached 3% in August. Despite stronger-than-expected economic growth in the second quarter, RBA Governor Michelle Bullock has warned that the economic outlook remains clouded by global uncertainty.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that the Trump administration is encouraging Taiwan to shift chip production so that half of America's demand is met by domestic manufacturing. This "50-50" proposal aims to significantly reduce U.S. reliance on Taiwan, which currently produces over 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors. Lutnick argued the move would enhance Taiwan's security, countering the "Silicon Shield" theory that its dominance in chipmaking deters a Chinese invasion. The plan aligns with Washington's broader goal of onshoring critical manufacturing and boosting its domestic semiconductor industry.</p>

The government, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD, is deeply divided on key policy areas, including the national budget, tax levels, and social security reforms. Disagreements also persist over immigration policy and the potential reintroduction of military conscription. The retreat aims to foster unity and resolve these internal conflicts, which have strained the coalition since it took office four months ago.</p>

          <p>Shares of Zijin Gold experienced a dramatic surge of over 60% during their trading debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The Chinese mining company's initial public offering (IPO) raised approximately $3.2 billion, making it the second-largest IPO globally this year. The successful listing comes at a time of record-high gold prices, driven by strong safe-haven demand and global economic uncertainty.

          <p>A new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has received positive reactions from leaders in Europe and the Middle East. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages by Hamas within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of a new international body to oversee Gaza's governance. President Trump warned Hamas to accept the deal or face continued Israeli military action with U.S. support. The Palestinian Authority described the efforts as "sincere," while a coalition of Arab nations expressed readiness to help implement the agreement.</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled a 20-point proposal aimed at ending the Israel-Hamas war, outlining a phased approach to de-escalation and future governance in Gaza. The plan mandates an immediate cessation of fighting and requires Hamas to release all remaining hostages in exchange for a large number of Palestinian prisoners. It also proposes that Gaza be governed by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" under the oversight of an international "Board of Peace" chaired by President Trump. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has endorsed the plan, Hamas's response remains uncertain, and key questions about implementation and timelines are still unanswered.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that a strategic, right-wing backlash is reversing progress on diversity and inclusion within Germany's cultural institutions. The author contends that what is framed as fatigue or a return to neutrality is actually a politically motivated effort to sideline marginalized voices, mirroring trends in the U.S. and amplified by the far-right AfD party. This shift is reportedly causing diversity programs to be cut and artists of color to face renewed scrutiny. The piece suggests this reactionary movement threatens not just representation but also the complexity and truth reflected in art.</p>

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are shifting their strategy to combat an economic slump by emulating discount models like those of Aldi and Lidl. These chains are reducing clutter in their large hypermarkets and focusing on developing their own private-label brands to offer quality goods at lower prices. This pivot is a response to changing consumer behavior, as shoppers become more frugal amid economic uncertainty. The move aims to reverse a trend of flat sales and declining store counts by appealing to a growing demand for value-for-money products.</p>

The altered video depicts Jeffries with a sombrero and mustache while an AI-generated voice for Schumer uses vulgar language, and it also promotes a racist conspiracy theory. Both Democratic leaders condemned the video as disgusting and a sign of Trump's inability to negotiate seriously.

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings that Hurricane Humberto, currently a major Category 3 storm, is likely to generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast this week. While the storm's center is forecast to pass west of Bermuda, its powerful swells will affect a wide area. Humberto rapidly intensified over the weekend, reaching Category 5 strength before weakening slightly.

The prolonged downturn reflects persistent challenges for manufacturers, including weak domestic demand and disruptions from global trade tensions.

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have arrested a seventh person, a 30-year-old woman, in connection with the horrific torture and killing of three young women that was allegedly livestreamed on Instagram. The victims, two aged 20 and one aged 15, were lured into a van and taken to a house where they were killed, with investigators linking the crime to drug trafficking gangs. The latest suspect is the niece of another man arrested for providing logistical support for the murders. The brutal killings have sparked widespread outrage and protests in Buenos Aires, drawing attention to the rising rates of gender-based violence in the country.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of the highest-ranking U.S. military officers have been called away from their posts worldwide to attend a rare, large-scale meeting in Quantico, Virginia. The summit was convened on short notice by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has rebranded the department as the "Department of War" and aims to restore what he calls the "warrior ethos." President Trump described the gathering as a meeting to discuss positive military progress and build esprit de corps. However, the event has generated speculation due to its unusual nature and Hegseth's controversial tenure, which has included firing senior officers.</p>

          <p>In a critical speech at the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to tell the nation it stands "at a fork in the road," presenting a stark choice between his party's vision of renewal and an alternative of decline and division. The address comes as Starmer faces internal criticism and pressure from the rise of the Reform UK party. He will argue that while Labour's path is difficult, it leads to a fairer country, contrasting it with what he portrays as the politics of grievance. The speech is seen as an attempt to shore up support and define the political battleground ahead of a difficult budget and upcoming elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While President Trump's 20-point proposal for Gaza represents a significant diplomatic shift, this analysis suggests it faces fundamental obstacles that may prevent its success. The plan's viability hinges on whether both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas leaders see more to gain from peace than from continued conflict, a long-standing impasse. The framework contains ambiguities that could allow either side to sabotage negotiations while blaming the other. Although it borrows from previous proposals and has gained some traction with Arab nations, the plan lacks detailed specifics on critical issues like Israeli withdrawal and post-war governance, leaving it vulnerable to collapse.</p>

          <p>Retired Paralympic world champion Stef Reid is advocating for major athletic brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to offer single shoes for sale instead of only pairs. Reid, who is an amputee and used a carbon-fibre blade for competition, highlights the financial waste and lack of inclusivity for athletes who only need one shoe. She argues that while brands use inclusive imagery, such as mannequins with blades, their retail experience fails to match this message. The campaign also speaks for thousands of non-disabled individuals with different-sized feet who face the same issue, urging for a more adaptable and customer-focused approach.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside of the U.S., claiming that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. He argued the levy would solve a long-standing problem and specifically mentioned California as being hard-hit. The threat has raised concerns in countries like Canada, whose film industry is deeply integrated with Hollywood productions. Investment analysts have questioned the feasibility of such a tariff, noting the complexities of defining a non-American film and the potential for increased costs to be passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota, challenging its so-called sanctuary city policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that these policies jeopardize public safety by allowing undocumented immigrants to bypass federal law. This legal action is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to compel state and local governments to comply with its aggressive deportation agenda. Minnesota joins several other Democratic-led jurisdictions, including Los Angeles and New York, in facing federal lawsuits over their sanctuary policies.</p>

Both parties appear entrenched in their positions, with each believing they hold the political high ground. With the deadline looming, there is little optimism for a resolution, raising the prospect of a disruptive and unpredictable federal closure.</p>

This development comes as Boeing continues to navigate the fallout from the 737 MAX's troubled history, including two fatal crashes and intense regulatory scrutiny.
