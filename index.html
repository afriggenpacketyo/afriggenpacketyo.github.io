          <p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith responded to former First Lady Michelle Obama's recent comments comparing sports talk shows to reality television. Smith took the opportunity to voice his lingering offense at remarks Obama made during the 2024 campaign, where she suggested a vote for Donald Trump was a vote against women. He clarified that while he did not vote for Trump, he felt her statement was a form of emotional blackmail that disregarded the diverse reasons people have for their political choices. Smith respectfully disagreed with both her political and media-related assertions, stating he remains "salty" about the campaign comments.</p>

Incumbent Matt Hayball is facing challenges from rookie James Burnip and newly signed American Kai Kroeger, with only one set to make the final 53-man roster. This continues a trend for the Saints, who have favored Australian punters, valued for their versatile kicking skills from their Australian rules football background. Despite the cutthroat nature of the competition, the players maintain a friendly camaraderie, focusing on personal performance in the intense environment.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a strong return from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Despite his promising performance, the Dodgers lost 4-0, with Snell giving up three runs on two home runs by Yandy Díaz. Both home runs took advantage of the unusually short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary stadium. While the result was a loss, Snell's sharp outing and command of his pitches were positive signs for the Dodgers, who are counting on his ace potential for their late-season and postseason ambitions.</p>

          <p>South African authorities have detained almost 1,000 undocumented migrants allegedly involved in illegal mining at the Sheba Gold Mine in Mpumalanga province. The week-long police operation, titled "Vala Umgodi," targeted the historic mine, which has been plagued by gold theft. Those arrested, who came from neighboring countries like Eswatini and Mozambique, will face charges for immigration violations and potential illegal mining activities. The issue highlights the broader problem of illegal mining in South Africa, where thousands of abandoned mines attract so-called "zama-zamas" seeking to make a living in dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>Gaza's Health Ministry reports that at least 325 people have been killed by Israeli forces over the past week while attempting to access scarce food aid. The deadly incidents persist despite Israeli assurances of a humanitarian pause, as a UN-backed report confirms a famine is unfolding in the territory. Israel maintains its troops have only fired warning shots and that aid restrictions are necessary to prevent Hamas from benefiting. Meanwhile, international aid agencies describe the situation as a crisis of collective punishment, with most aid being looted by armed gangs and desperate crowds before it can be distributed.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's announcement that she will not run for governor of California has reset the race, leaving no clear front-runner among the remaining candidates. With Harris out, contenders like former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are vying for prominence, but political observers note that none currently possess statewide name recognition. The wide-open field now places a greater emphasis on fundraising, endorsements, and the ability to build a public profile. The latest financial disclosures show a varied landscape, with some candidates holding millions while others will need to ramp up fundraising significantly.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has climbed to €3,248, a figure that is increasingly unaffordable for many retirees. This sharp rise is driven by necessary wage increases for care staff and a higher number of personnel, creating a significant financial burden on residents and their families. With Germany's population aging, the number of people needing care is projected to grow by 37% by 2055, placing the statutory long-term care insurance system under immense strain. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reforms to address the dramatic gap between income and care expenditures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe was initiated following a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's criminal investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency that enforces restrictions on political activities by government employees and is separate from the Department of Justice role Smith held. Since Smith is no longer a government employee, the potential repercussions of the investigation remain unclear, though its findings could be referred to the DOJ.</p>

During the arrest at his Polk County home, deputies discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device, prompting an evacuation and the involvement of a bomb squad and the ATF. A subsequent search uncovered 14 explosive devices, and investigators determined O'Neal had attempted to detonate them as officers arrived. He now faces nine counts of attempted first-degree murder for the officers present, along with other charges, and is being held in jail without bond.</p>

The Police Federation, representing over 145,000 officers, criticized the award as barely enough to "tread water," arguing it fails to address over a decade of real-terms pay cuts and will not curb record resignations. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the raise is a "clear signal of our gratitude" and will be supported by £120 million in government funding.

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted the Trump administration's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit panel ruled that the government cannot use the presidential proclamation to ignore laws requiring officials to consider claims for other humanitarian protections, such as withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system itself, it affirmed that mandatory protections cannot be unilaterally suspended. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the ACLU challenging the legality of the border closure policy.</p>

The decision keeps in place an injunction requiring ICE and CBP agents to have specific evidence of illegal status before making an arrest.

          <p>Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton described his own driving as "useless" after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him in 12th place. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprise pole position, Hamilton struggled for pace and failed to advance to the final qualifying round. A downcast Hamilton took full responsibility, stating his poor performance had "nothing to do with the car" and congratulated Leclerc on the team's achievement. This result continues a trend of qualifying struggles for Hamilton, who has often been outpaced by his teammate on Saturdays this season.</p>

          <p>Health officials are warning the public to avoid the water near Camp Richardson resort on Lake Tahoe's southern shore after a sewage leak led to the detection of high levels of E. coli bacteria. The U.S. Forest Service issued the advisory after water quality samples confirmed the contamination, prompting the resort to locate and repair the leak. While no illnesses have been reported, swimmers and boaters are advised to stay out of the water in the affected area from Jameson Beach to the Valhalla Boathouse. This incident follows a major sewage spill on the lake's northern shore last summer.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Gothamist has reportedly uncovered over 50 fraudulent signatures on New York City Mayor Eric Adams's petition to appear on the November ballot as an independent candidate. The findings include names of deceased individuals and people who claim they were deceived into signing. While the number of invalid signatures is unlikely to prevent Adams from qualifying, as his campaign submitted nearly 50,000, the discovery adds another layer of complexity to the contentious mayoral race. The Adams campaign stated it expects its contractors to follow the law and will conduct its own review of the signatures.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced significant turbulence this week, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high before ending on a four-day losing streak. The volatility was fueled by a confluence of major events, including a much weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which prompted President Trump to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. This followed the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady and the administration's announcement of new "reciprocal" tariff rates. The confluence of poor economic data, political shake-ups, and mixed corporate earnings from tech giants left investors navigating considerable uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent article explores several behavioral signs that may indicate a person is secretly struggling with their finances, even if their lifestyle appears affluent. These indicators include a lack of a formal financial plan, a tendency to spend heavily on brand-name items to project wealth, and confusing a high income with actual net worth. The report also highlights a lack of financial discipline, such as frequent impulse buying funded by credit, and chasing get-rich-quick schemes instead of pursuing steady, long-term wealth-building strategies. These habits often lead to living paycheck-to-paycheck and accumulating significant debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Before her dismissal, England's power and skill were on full display, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick.

Despite the state government's removal of climate change from official policy, the economic benefits are fueling the boom.
