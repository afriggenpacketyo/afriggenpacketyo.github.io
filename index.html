        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein's plans for a London IPO have reportedly stalled due to regulatory hurdles, leading the company to consider a Hong Kong listing instead. The shift comes amid increasing scrutiny over Shein's labor practices and commercial operations, including allegations of forced labor and consumer protection violations. An EU investigation found the company in breach of consumer protection laws, citing fake discounts and misleading sustainability claims. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods adds to the company's challenges, contributing to reluctance from Chinese regulators to approve the IPO. Optimism surrounding Shein's future is tempered by the persistent ethical and regulatory concerns it faces.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly engaging in mega drug-licensing deals with multinational corporations, driven by cost savings and depressed valuations. These deals often utilize a "newco structure," combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential deals worth up to US$5 billion for its drug candidates, leading to a surge in its shares. This trend reflects an alternative approach for Chinese biotech firms to raise capital amid challenging market conditions, with the number and value of deals exceeding those of the previous year.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities anticipate a public notice easing the ban, in place since August 2023, and the reopening of registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue advocating for the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This agreement marks a potential easing of tensions between the two nations, though the registration process and radiation checks may delay shipments for a few months.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding a major crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, especially with the Trump administration's efforts to be seen as an ally to the industry. Binance, the world's largest digital assets exchange, has also recently established ties with World Liberty Financial, a project with connections to the Trump family.</p>

The prosecutor argued that the judge, Julieta Makintach, violated judicial ethics by allowing a camera crew to film closed-door hearings. The retrial throws into doubt the timeline of the case, which began in March and was expected to last until July, as the court will select three new judges by lottery.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now working to aggressively revoke visas of Chinese students in critical fields, echoing the historical mistake.

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, has cautioned that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the escalating China-US rivalry. While the likelihood of full-scale financial sanctions remains slim, Washington could adopt a strategy of targeting specific Chinese entities before gradually expanding the scope. Lian noted that implementing full-blown financial sanctions, such as cutting China off from the Swift system, would be difficult due to China's significant role in global trade and investment. He added that excluding China from Swift could lead countries to shift to China's alternative, the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), undermining Swift's importance.

The court gave the White House 10 days to remove almost all tariffs, which it says have been imposed illegally, but a federal appeals court has stayed the trade court's ruling. The administration argued in its appeal that a ruling against Trump "would kneecap the president on the world stage, cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals, imperil the government's ability to respond to these and future national emergencies". The power to make or break the economy has rested on his shoulders, as the tariff rates levelled against other countries keep going up and down.</p>
