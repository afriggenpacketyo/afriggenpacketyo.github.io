        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding the use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology by rolling out 10 new vans to seven police forces across England. This aims to aid in locating suspects for serious crimes, including sexual offenses and homicides, with the government citing successful arrests in London. However, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch express alarm, calling it a significant expansion of the surveillance state and raising concerns about privacy, false matches, and the current lack of a robust legal framework. A consultation is underway to establish safeguards, though critics argue the technology has been deployed without proper legislative basis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has tempered expectations for the upcoming summit between President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska, describing it as primarily a "listening exercise" for Trump. This downplaying comes as Russia intensifies its offensive in eastern Ukraine, with Moscow maintaining maximalist demands for peace, including territorial retention and Ukraine's renunciation of NATO ambitions. Concerns persist among Kyiv and European allies that Trump might push for peace at the cost of Ukrainian territorial concessions, a notion Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected. Analysts suggest the premise of land swapping has already diminished the summit's chances of success.</p>

          <p>Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic believes the company's small modular reactors (SMRs), designed to power energy-intensive AI data centers, could make it the UK's most valuable firm. The engineering giant has secured deals with the UK and Czech governments for SMR development, aiming to dominate an estimated $1 trillion global market by 2050. Despite SMRs being an unproven technology, Erginbilgic is confident in their future potential and the company's unique nuclear capabilities. This ambitious vision, alongside strong performance in its aircraft engine business, underpins a significant turnaround for Rolls-Royce, with its share price increasing tenfold since early 2023.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is mandating a comprehensive review of content at several Smithsonian Institution museums and exhibits, aiming to align them with President Trump's "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History" executive order. This initiative seeks to ensure portrayals of American heritage are "historically accurate, uplifting, and inclusive," removing any "divisive or partisan narratives." The review, impacting museums like American History and African American History and Culture, involves analyzing current and future content, interviewing staff, and scrutinizing all related materials. The administration anticipates completing this process by early 2026, emphasizing a focus on "Americanism" and restoring confidence in shared cultural institutions.</p>

The report specifically cited "serious restrictions" on free speech, including laws around abortion clinic access zones and government intervention to "chill speech" online following the 2024 Southport attack. It also highlighted instances of antisemitic violence and inconsistent prosecution of officials for human rights abuses. This criticism echoes previous remarks by US Vice-President JD Vance, although the UK government maintains its commitment to upholding freedoms while ensuring public safety.</p>

A BBC Freedom of Information request revealed that 33 local authorities permanently lowered temperatures, though none fell below recommended guidelines. The Local Government Association highlights the "fragile position" of council finances, with nearly a quarter of English councils cutting or closing leisure services. Critics, including individuals with muscular dystrophy, fear these colder temperatures deter some people from swimming, negatively impacting their health and access to vital non-weight-bearing exercise.</p>

          <p>New guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) encourages police forces in England to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive investigations. This aims to combat misinformation and address significant public interest, particularly after cases where a lack of information led to the spread of false rumors and even riots. While decisions remain with individual forces, the Home Office supports this move for greater transparency and consistency. However, some former police officials warn of potential "unintended consequences," suggesting it could create an expectation for such details in every case, leading to more speculation when information is withheld.</p>

          <p>Major Dubai developers are increasingly establishing in-house contracting firms, moving away from reliance on third-party contractors. This strategic shift, exemplified by Emaar Properties forming Rukn Mirage, aims to enhance control over construction timelines, costs, and quality, ultimately maximizing profits amid a booming real estate market. With property prices up 70% in four years and a government plan to double the population by 2040, developers face challenges attracting external bids. While internalizing construction offers greater certainty and aligns with UAE's self-reliance push, experts caution about potential risks, including split focus and idle capacity during market downturns.

The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, with at least eight fatalities and a state of emergency declared.

          <p>California is challenging the legality of President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in a federal court case. The state argues that the "unprecedented" military presence violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, and caused "anxiety and fear" among residents. Federal lawyers contend the deployment was lawful, aimed at protecting federal property and personnel, and did not violate the act. The case hinges on whether Trump's justification of the protests as a "rebellion" under Title 10 grants him broad authority, a point of contention with the judge and state attorneys.</p>

The article expresses concern that Trump might emerge from the Alaska summit echoing Kremlin talking points, proposing a ceasefire that Zelenskyy cannot accept, thus allowing Putin to blame Ukrainian intransigence for prolonged conflict.

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested as part of a special prosecutor's probe into various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation, and influence peddling. The Seoul Central District Court granted the arrest warrant, citing a risk of evidence destruction. This marks the first time a former South Korean presidential couple has been simultaneously jailed on criminal allegations, with Yoon himself arrested last month over a martial law decree. The investigation into Kim is one of three launched under the new liberal government targeting Yoon's presidency, underscoring persistent political turmoil and high-level corruption.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Foreign Firms Contributed Significantly to China's Emissions Over Two Decades</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study, published in Nature Communications, found that multinational enterprises (MNEs) were responsible for 25% of all company emissions in China over the past two decades. The research, conducted by a collaboration of Chinese and international institutions, highlights that while eastern coastal regions reaped economic benefits, central and western inland regions bore heavier environmental pressures. This finding raises new questions regarding the scientific assessment of carbon emission responsibilities for foreign-owned enterprises, underscoring MNEs as a "non-negligible yet frequently overlooked factor" in shaping global carbon inequality. The article emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of emissions accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's imposition of 39% tariffs on Swiss exports has shattered Switzerland's long-held economic and political complacency. Traditionally thriving on exports and maintaining neutrality, the country now faces severe economic repercussions, with its industry lobbying group warning of "annihilated" sales to the US. The author suggests that Switzerland's "have your cake and eat it" policy of enjoying free-world benefits without sharing burdens is no longer viable in a new era of cutthroat geoeconomics. This unexpected move has provoked an identity crisis, forcing Switzerland to reconsider its diplomatic approach and potentially its relationship with the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion takeover bid for Google's Chrome internet browser, arguing that an independent operator committed to user safety would benefit the public. Perplexity, which recently launched its own AI-powered browser, proposes to maintain Google as the default search engine while supporting the open-source Chromium platform. However, technology industry investors have dismissed the offer as a "stunt," significantly undervaluing Chrome and questioning whether Google has any intention of selling its dominant browser. This move comes as Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny, with a federal judge potentially ordering a breakup of its search business. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting location, a US military base with historical ties to Russia, adds symbolic weight. Trump has consistently pushed for a swift resolution to the conflict, even setting a ceasefire deadline. While the White House is tempering expectations, describing it as a "listening exercise," Trump has mentioned potential "land swapping" to regain Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is not expected to attend but will hold a virtual meeting with Trump and European leaders beforehand, insisting that any agreements made without Ukraine's input would be "dead decisions."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of suspended UCLA science research grants, totaling over $584 million, which were abruptly frozen last month. The judge ruled that the National Science Foundation's "suspension" of these grants violated her previous injunction against science funding terminations. The Trump administration had frozen over half a billion dollars in federal grants to UCLA, citing alleged discrimination in admissions and failure to combat antisemitism, demanding over $1 billion for their restoration. UCLA officials welcomed the ruling as critical for their research, which spans vital areas like cancer and clean energy, and provides leverage against the administration's demands.</p>
