        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, activists in Los Angeles organized protests, leading to the deployment of National Guard troops to protect federal property and personnel. The protests began after ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations, resulting in arrests of immigrants. Demonstrators gathered outside federal buildings and detention centers, leading to clashes with law enforcement, including the use of non-lethal munitions. President Trump ordered the National Guard deployment, criticizing local officials' handling of the situation, while California Governor Gavin Newsom called the move inflammatory. The Department of Homeland Security reported that the ICE operations resulted in numerous arrests, including individuals linked to criminal organizations. The situation has sparked debates over immigration policies and the role of federal intervention in local law enforcement matters.</p>

          <p>The government is contemplating introducing stricter online safety measures, potentially limiting children's time on social media, with proposals including a two-hour cap on individual social media apps and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones as a key concern. An online safety campaigner criticized the government's delay in enacting new laws to protect children, highlighting the potential harm caused by weak regulation and inaction by big tech. While parental controls and screen time limits are available on some platforms, their usage is reportedly low, and some parents find the options overwhelming.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously decided the case of Ames v. Ohio, concerning discrimination based on sexual orientation, with Justice Jackson playing a key role. The case involved a heterosexual woman who sued after being passed over for a promotion and subsequently demoted in favor of gay employees. The court's decision highlights the question of how much the law should treat a person as an individual versus as a member of a group. The ruling underscores the importance of ceasing malicious discrimination, but also raises questions about whether institutions should provide assistance to targeted groups to increase diversity and overcome systemic discrimination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles to address protests against ICE actions is viewed by some as an attempt to provoke conflict and assert authoritarian control. By militarizing the situation, Trump may be seeking to divert attention from his failures, establish himself as a strongman, and test the military's willingness to follow his orders. The move is also seen as a way to undermine California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Critics urge restraint and non-violent responses to avoid providing Trump with the pretext for further authoritarian measures.</p>

Some customers reported issues with the fruit getting stuck in the straw, while others longed for the return of discontinued items like the churro. The introduction of the new beverage follows recent changes to Costco's food court menu, including the revival of the combo pizza in calzone form and the replacement of Pepsi products with Coca-Cola.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples has identified the most frequent causes of conflict in relationships, with tone of voice or attitude topping the list due to its signal of contempt. Family relations and unmet needs, especially regarding support and parenting values, also contribute significantly to arguments. Uneven distribution of household chores and the associated "invisible load" are often sources of tension, as is ineffective communication that escalates conflicts. The article suggests strategies for moving past these issues, such as naming the effect of contemptuous behavior, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated word or phrase to signal a time-out during arguments.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles is viewed by some as a tactic to redirect dissent from policy failures to a perceived 'enemy within.' By focusing on protests against ICE, Trump aims to divert attention from issues such as his feud with Elon Musk and policy shortcomings. Critics see this as an authoritarian flex, reminiscent of his actions during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. The deployment is also seen as an attempt to whip up support from his base by targeting California, a state often portrayed as a hub of 'wokeness' and immigration lawlessness.</p>
