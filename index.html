          <p>Adam Elmasri, a 15-year-old basketball player standing at 201 centimeters, is garnering attention in Japan for his potential to emulate Rui Hachimura and reach the NBA. Elmasri, who was born to a Japanese mother and Australian father, is developing his skills at the youth academy of the Yokohama B-Corsairs and has already participated in training camps for Japan's under-16 national team. Elmasri hopes to refine his all-around game, with a focus on center and power forward positions, and dreams of competing in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics for Australia.

          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 civilians, India conducted strikes on what it claimed were terrorist sites within Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian government stated that the strikes were measured and non-escalatory, targeting nine sites allegedly used for planning attacks against India, while Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war. The strikes on Punjab, outside of the Kashmir region, marked an escalation in the conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries, prompting global leaders to warn of dire consequences if de-escalation is not achieved. Both sides reported aircraft losses, and cross-border shelling resulted in casualties and displacement of villagers. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical company, has revised its sales growth forecast for 2025 due to increased competition from copycat compounders affecting sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy. Despite this, the company reported first-quarter net profits exceeding expectations, driven by strong sales of its diabetes treatment, Ozempic. While Wegovy sales rose significantly year-over-year, they fell slightly short of analyst predictions. Overall revenues increased, but the company has lowered its full-year sales growth projection from 16-24% to 13-21% and its operating profit growth forecast from 19-27% to 16-24%. </p>

          <p>Despite U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's claims of being close to trade deals and meetings between U.S. officials and counterparts from Canada and China, President Trump contradicted this by stating that other countries need deals with the U.S., but the U.S. does not need deals with them. This protectionist stance is ironically pushing other countries to forge closer economic ties, exemplified by a U.K.-India trade agreement and ASEAN-China negotiations to improve their free-trade agreement. These developments suggest that new economic connections may bypass the U.S., potentially reshaping the global trade landscape.

          <p>Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named "Operation Sindoor" - were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead "accountable". Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as "unprovoked", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the "heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished".

          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of monetary policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and reduced reserve requirements for banks, in response to the trade war with the United States. These measures are designed to stimulate the economy by increasing lending and supporting key sectors like technology and real estate. The announcement follows news of upcoming trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, signaling a potential de-escalation in trade tensions. However, analysts suggest that the impact of these measures may be modest due to lackluster demand from borrowers, and that further fiscal policy measures may be necessary to meet China's economic growth targets.

          <p>Criminals who refuse to attend sentencing in England and Wales could face an additional two years in prison, under a new bill to be introduced to Parliament on Wednesday. Additional powers for judges to punish offenders absent from sentencing will mean they cannot "opt out" of justice, victims' families have said. It is not about punishment through force - but about ensuring that perpetrators cannot remove themselves from the consequences of their actions, said the families of murdered primary school teacher Sabina Nessa, law graduate Zara Aleena and mother-of-three Jan Mustafa.</p>

These remarks come as Nvidia navigates the impact of U.S. export controls, which now extend to the company's China-tailored H20 AI chips, impacting its ability to compete in a market that contributed a significant portion of its revenue last financial year.

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of “modern-day appeasement” in his approach to Russia and expressed fears that Europe would “lose confidence in the certainty of America.” Speaking in Delaware as the Allied nations mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, Biden said Trump’s stance was “modern-day appeasement” in reference to the attempts of British prime minister Neville Chamberlain’s to appease Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. He also said he feared Europe was going to lose confidence in the “certainty of America and the leadership of America” and that a breakdown of US-Europe relations under Trump “would change the modern history of the world”.</p>

In addition to lipid infusions, Finley receives carbohydrates and proteins through a separate tube in his stomach and is preparing to abseil down a tower block to raise money for the hospital that provides his care. </p>
