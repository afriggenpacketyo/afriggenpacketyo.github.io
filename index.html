          <p>The Kremlin has tempered expectations for a direct summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite calls from Donald Trump for such a meeting to end the war. Trump, fresh from discussions with Putin and European leaders, acknowledged the conflict's difficulty and suggested Putin might not be interested in a peace deal, while still offering US air support if European allies provide ground troops. Russia insists any talks must be gradually prepared, starting at an expert level, as the conflict continues to cause widespread casualties and destruction. European leaders and Zelenskyy remain open to direct talks, hoping to influence Trump's stance against Moscow.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are projected to open lower, reflecting a negative shift in global sentiment despite earlier positive reactions to recent diplomatic talks involving the US, Ukraine, and European leaders. Key indexes across the UK, Germany, France, and Italy are all anticipated to decline. Investors are keenly awaiting the UK's July inflation figures, expected to show a rise to 3.7%, and the Federal Reserve's July meeting minutes, which could offer clues on future interest rate decisions. The Fed funds futures market currently indicates a high probability of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next policy meeting in September, with two Fed governors dissenting from the previous rate hold.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines, mirroring Wall Street's overnight losses, as investors processed key economic data including Japan's trade figures and China's loan prime rate decision. Japan's exports notably fell by 2.6% year-over-year in July, marking their steepest contraction in over four years, exceeding economists' expectations. Major regional indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi were down, while shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart surprisingly rose after initially dropping, following a significant profit surge. China maintained its key lending rates for the third consecutive month, aligning with market forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart's shares reversed earlier declines to rise over 8% after the company reported a nearly 400% surge in net profit for the first half of 2025, driven by the booming global popularity of its "ugly-cute" Labubu dolls. Revenue also jumped over 200%, exceeding forecasts. Despite this success, some analysts express caution regarding the long-term popularity of Pop Mart's intellectual properties and the company's valuation, citing high business risk. The company's unique "blind box" marketing strategy has been criticized by Chinese state media for encouraging excessive spending by children, prompting calls for stricter oversight.

          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump, despite his divisive policies, is inadvertently becoming a significant unifier for Europe, particularly concerning the Ukraine conflict. His recent meeting with Vladimir Putin and subsequent interactions prompted an unprecedented show of unity from seven European leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington. While concerns remain about potential territorial concessions in Ukraine, European nations are converging on the necessity of robust security guarantees from the US, even if Europe bears the cost. The author suggests that Trump's actions, though cynical, are compelling Europeans to forge a stronger collective identity in response to external pressures.</p>

          <p>China's historic Long March-5 rocket launch for a moon mission was subtly altered due to the Philippines' evolving maritime claims, as revealed in a recent paper by China’s Journal of Astronautics. Engineers delayed the release of the rocket’s nose cone by several dozen seconds, effectively nudging the splashdown of debris further out to sea, away from waters considered by Manila to be under its jurisdiction. This adjustment was made in response to "new domestic regulations and evolving claims over foreign territorial sea baselines," as stated by the mission's deputy chief designer, underscoring how geopolitical sensitivities can influence even scientific and space exploration endeavors.</p>

          <p>Councils across England are considering legal action to remove asylum seekers from hotels, following a High Court ruling that granted Epping Forest District Council a temporary injunction to block lodging at The Bell Hotel. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage encouraged other councils to follow Epping's lead, while a Conservative-run council in Broxbourne is also seeking legal advice. The Home Office faces challenges, with ministers bracing for more legal actions, despite aiming to close all asylum hotels by the end of the current Parliament. The Epping case was unique, citing safety risks and planning law breaches, particularly after an asylum seeker was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed ongoing discussions for the US government to acquire a 10% equity stake in chip giant Intel, potentially by swapping government grants for shares. This unusual move aims to bolster Intel's competitiveness against rivals and support the establishment of a flagship manufacturing hub in Ohio, aligning with national security and economic priorities. The proposal comes after Japanese investment firm Softbank recently purchased a $2 billion stake in Intel, signaling confidence in the company's turnaround efforts. While offering a potential boost, analysts warn that political involvement could introduce uncertainty and slow decision-making for Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly employing tariffs as a political weapon rather than a traditional economic tool, effectively replacing diplomacy in its foreign policy. This is evident in the threat of a 50% tariff on India for its continued purchase of Russian oil, and linking Canada's tariffs to its stance on Palestinian statehood. Experts argue this approach, termed "national security tariffs" by a top advisor, serves to compel loyalty and realign global leadership rather than solely address trade imbalances. Critics warn this aggressive policy, coupled with the dismantling of diplomatic instruments like the State Department, could alienate allies and push countries like India closer to China.</p>

          <p>Three firefighters were injured, one sustaining severe burns to his hands and arms, after a hit-and-run driver crashed into a North Carolina veterinary clinic, causing a gas explosion. The incident unfolded when a vehicle ruptured a gas line at the Eastern Carolina Veterinary Medical Center, and the explosion occurred while Wilmington firefighters were conducting a search of the building to ensure it was empty. The driver, Jason Lee Beach, was later located, arrested, and charged with felony DWI, hit and run, and other offenses. Fortunately, no civilians were inside the clinic at the time of the blast, and fire crews successfully secured the gas leak and brought the subsequent fire under control.</p>

          <p>Air Canada flights are set to resume after a tentative agreement was reached between the airline and the union representing its flight attendants, ending a nearly four-day strike that grounded flights and stranded thousands of passengers. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) hailed the deal as achieving "transformational change" for workers, including immediate pay increases and ground pay for previously unpaid work hours. The breakthrough came after government-appointed mediation, despite the union initially rejecting an order to return to work. While operations are restarting, Air Canada warns it may take days to return to a full service due to aircraft and crew being out of position.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the entire US-Mexico border wall will be painted black, a measure requested by President Trump to make the metal hotter and deter illegal immigration. Noem, who participated in painting a section of the wall, highlighted the wall's height and depth as deterrents. The black paint is also intended to help prevent rust. This initiative is part of the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to fortify the southern border, supported by recent congressional funding of $46 billion for wall completion and expanded immigration enforcement. The border wall's design will vary based on topography, including "water-borne infrastructure" in river sections.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to expand his "anti-woke" crusade from the Smithsonian Institution to museums across the United States, criticizing exhibits for focusing on negative aspects of American history like slavery rather than "Success" or "Brightness." He stated that his attorneys would initiate the same process used for colleges and universities to vet content. This follows his earlier executive order targeting "improper ideology" at the Smithsonian and his failed attempt to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery. Museum alliances and institutions like the Japanese American National Museum condemn these actions as censorship and an attempt to "sanitize and reshape history," warning of a chilling effect on open inquiry.</p>

The fire, which occurred in January and resulted in 12 deaths and significant destruction, has been under scrutiny regarding whether a previous fire, believed extinguished, reignited. Fire commissioners expressed frustration over the delay, emphasizing the need to understand what worked and what didn't during fire season. The mayor previously removed the Fire Chief over concerns about communication and pre-deployment decisions during the incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning against consuming certain raw frozen shrimp sold under the Great Value brand at Walmart stores in 13 states, due to potential contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. Customs and Border Protection detected the substance in a shipment from an Indonesian company, although the contaminated sample did not enter US commerce. While the detected amount would not pose an acute hazard, long-term consumption could elevate cancer risk. Walmart has recalled the affected products, and the FDA is coordinating with Indonesian authorities to investigate the source of contamination, advising consumers to dispose of the listed shrimp.</p>

Local authorities found the heads on a route connecting Puebla and Tlaxcala, with local media reporting a message warning rival gangs, purportedly from a group called "La Barredora." While the motive remains unclear, the region is known for fuel smuggling. This gruesome discovery comes amid a major crackdown on fentanyl trafficking by President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration and follows other recent acts of extreme violence in different parts of Mexico, highlighting the pervasive issue of cartel conflict.</p>

          <p>An ongoing outbreak of leptospirosis, a kidney disease, is significantly impacting California sea lion populations, primarily in Central and Northern California, with over 200 affected animals since early July. This bacterial disease causes kidney failure in marine mammals and has a high mortality rate among sea lions. Humans can contract leptospirosis through contaminated water or soil, with symptoms including fever, headache, and jaundice, though it's treatable with antibiotics. Experts advise pet owners to keep dogs leashed near shorelines and avoid marine mammals, as the disease can be fatal to dogs. Historically, outbreaks occurred every 3-5 years, but have become more frequent since 2018.</p>

If confirmed, this would position China as a global leader in "loyal wingman" technology, a concept where drones operate in tandem with piloted aircraft.
