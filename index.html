          <h2>Lawmakers Urge Duke to End Partnership with Chinese University Amid Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>Two Republican lawmakers are pressuring Duke University to terminate its joint campus program with Wuhan University in China, citing worries about technology transfers and the potential manipulation of students. The congressmen expressed concerns that the partnership creates a 'direct pipeline' between U.S. innovation and China's military-industrial complex, allowing American students to be used for Chinese propaganda. Duke Kunshan University (DKU), established in 2013, offers students dual degrees from both Duke and DKU, with opportunities for exchanges at Duke's North Carolina campus, which raises concerns about access to federally funded research. The lawmakers argue that DKU specializes in high-technology fields with military applications, posing a risk to U.S. academic openness.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday after failing to reach an agreement on pay raises, leading to a complete shutdown of train services and impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. NJ Transit is advising commuters to work from home and is implementing a contingency plan with increased bus services, although it can only accommodate approximately 20% of daily train riders. The strike also affects Metro-North's west of Hudson service, with the MTA cross-honoring tickets on the Port Jervis and Pascack Valley lines. With a Shakira concert scheduled at MetLife Stadium, NJ Transit preemptively canceled train service for Thursday night to prevent disruptions.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are set to meet in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the start of the war, though expectations for significant progress are low. The negotiations follow days of confusion and theatrics, with President Trump supporting the talks and President Zelensky initially calling for President Putin to attend in person. The U.S. and Turkey are involved in the talks, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Keith Kellogg attending an initial round with Ukrainian and Turkish officials. Despite the low expectations, the meeting is seen as an attempt by President Putin to engage with President Trump and convince the White House that Russia is not obstructing peace in Ukraine.</p>

The Reform party held the lead in voting intentions for the entire month of February, marking the first time in over a century that neither of the major parties held the top spot. Support for Reform is increasing across all demographic groups, particularly among younger voters, while Labour's share has declined across the country. The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, falling from a neutral stance to a more negative perception than Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are debating a bill to legalize assisted dying, following significant changes and amendments. The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, has undergone six months of scrutiny and now includes provisions for expert panels to oversee the process instead of High Court judges. Key amendments being considered include ensuring no obligation for medical staff to participate and preventing doctors from discussing assisted dying with individuals under 18 unless initiated by the patient. The government has quietly corrected its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647, leading to criticism from some MPs about the chaotic process.</p>

She suggests that the party's 'original sin' is its tendency toward groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion, which led to a widespread refusal to acknowledge Biden's infirmity. Goldberg contends that while Biden's inner circle concealed the extent of his decline, the issue was evident to many voters, and Democrats should be honest about their missteps. She also notes the gerontocracy in American politics and the disconnect between Washington insiders and the public's perception of Biden's leadership.</p>

India's influence is visible in its relationship with Pakistan, as the two countries have not played a bilateral series since 2013 due to political tensions.

          <p>Chinese trade envoy Li Chenggang characterized the recent trade discussions with the U.S. as 'good' after their initial high-level engagement in Switzerland, which led to a temporary easing of trade tensions. Both sides have maintained a restrained tone, with no new details on the trade talks disclosed during a daily press briefing by China's Ministry of Commerce. While President Trump suggested the possibility of a call with President Xi Jinping, Beijing remained tight-lipped about this prospect. The initial round of negotiations in Geneva was viewed positively in Beijing, as it validated China's firm response to Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Frank Bruni, Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Nate Silver engaged in a roundtable discussion to analyze President Trump's performance during his second term, focusing on his approval ratings and the state of the economy. Trump's numbers declined in April due to the tariffs, which also produced some of the lowest consumer confidence numbers since the 2008 recession. The panelists discussed the challenges facing the Democratic Party, with Anderson noting that it is unclear what the Democratic Party is for. The experts also discussed the importance of the economy and immigration as key issues influencing voter sentiment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's denouncements of 'activist judges' for allegedly obstructing his agenda is a practice with historical precedent, although he may be the most vocal president to do so. The Constitution enshrines the principle of an independent judiciary and the separation of powers, but presidents and members of Congress have criticized the federal courts when they disagree with their decisions. The term 'judicial activism' was coined in 1947, but criticism of activist judges predates the term and has come from both ends of the political spectrum. The article examines how the term has been used throughout history, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan.</p>

          <p>Two officials fired by President Trump are challenging his authority to remove board members from agencies created by Congress to be independent of the White House. Appellate judges in Washington, D.C., are considering whether Trump overstepped when he removed National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox and Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris without cause. The Trump administration argues that the Constitution gives the president the power to control the executive branch as he sees fit, while Wilcox and Harris warn that a ruling in Trump's favor would put the independence of other government boards, including the Federal Reserve, at risk.</p>

          <p>Despite abortion remaining legal in many states, a growing trend of clinic closures is emerging, driven by financial and operational challenges. At least 17 clinics closed last year in states where abortion remains legal, and another 17 have closed in the first five months of this year. Experts say that financial and operational challenges, rather than future legal bans, may be the biggest threats to abortion access in states whose laws still protect it. Rising costs, limited reimbursement rates, and growing demand for telehealth services are contributing to the financial strain on clinics.</p>
