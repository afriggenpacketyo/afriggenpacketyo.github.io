          <p>Elon Musk, despite his falling out with Donald Trump, possesses the financial capacity to significantly influence the 2026 midterm elections. He could fund primary challenges against Republicans or even launch a new political party, potentially disrupting the existing political landscape. Musk's ability to fund spoiler third-party candidates in key swing states could exploit the narrow margins in national elections, potentially shifting the balance of power. The American political system's calcified nature makes it uniquely vulnerable to such disruptions, given the close partisan divides.</p>

Wagner's departure follows heavy losses and accusations of targeting civilians, with the UN urging investigations into alleged abuses.</p>

          <p>Despite their recent feud, Donald Trump and Elon Musk remain intertwined through campaign funding, government contracts, and personal relationships. Musk's past donations to Republicans and Trump have been substantial, and his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have significant government contracts. Canceling these contracts would be a complicated legal process, and Musk's companies also face investigations from various government agencies. The two men's political and business interests remain linked, ensuring that their fallout will have far-reaching implications.</p>

          <p>Republican congresswoman Mary Miller is facing backlash after disparaging a Sikh prayer in the US House, initially misidentifying the Sikh as Muslim. Miller published, then deleted, a post on X stating that a Sikh should not have delivered the House's morning prayer, claiming America was founded as a Christian nation. Her comments triggered widespread outrage, with many condemning her ignorance and bigotry. Critics emphasized the importance of religious freedom and inclusivity.</p>

          <p>Amazon's delivery robot initiative aims to automate approximately $200 billion in logistics costs, potentially saving billions annually by 2030. These AI-powered humanoid robots will deliver packages directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans, reducing delivery times and labor costs. Morgan Stanley analysts see Amazon as well-positioned to benefit financially from physical AI robots within the next 3-5 years. The firm projects that 10% of U.S. units going through robotics-enabled warehouses can lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030 (not investment advice).</p>
