          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has asserted that Russia is conducting "hybrid warfare" against Europe, pointing to a consistent pattern of cyberattacks, airspace violations, and election interference. This form of conflict merges conventional military actions with subversive tactics intended to destabilize adversaries while maintaining deniability. An intelligence report highlights a dramatic increase in these incidents since early 2022, primarily targeting nations that support Ukraine and prompting European leaders to enhance regional security measures.</p>

          <p>Russia's state-owned nuclear energy company, Rosatom, is reportedly making preparations to restart the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is the largest in Europe and currently under Russian military control. The plant's six reactors are all currently in shutdown, and it has been disconnected from the power grid, relying on backup generators for essential cooling systems. This development occurs amid ongoing reciprocal drone attacks by both Russia and Ukraine, which have increasingly targeted each other's energy infrastructure, including recent damage to port facilities in Odesa.</p>

          <p>Catherine, the Princess of Wales, has cautioned that the overuse of smartphones and other digital devices is fostering an "epidemic of disconnection" that harms family life. In an essay, she argues that while technology promises connectivity, it often results in people being physically present but mentally absent, undermining meaningful interactions. The princess emphasizes that strong human relationships are vital for lifelong mental and physical health, expressing concern that the current generation is growing up more isolated despite being technologically connected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of households in England are facing higher water bills after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved requests from five water companies for additional price hikes. Anglian, Northumbrian, Southern, Wessex, and South East water companies argued that the original increases set by the regulator Ofwat were insufficient to fund necessary infrastructure investments. The CMA granted a partial approval, allowing an average additional increase of about £12 per year, citing the rise in borrowing costs for the companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing rules, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars in England and Wales. The proposed reforms aim to reduce red tape and support the hospitality sector by making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host live music. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer framed the review as a way to boost the economy, critics from public health charities have warned that relaxing alcohol sales regulations could lead to an increase in antisocial behavior and crime.</p>

          <p>A report from the international football player union FIFPRO has raised concerns about the excessive workload of elite footballers, using Moroccan star Achraf Hakimi as a key example. Last season, Hakimi played 69 matches, accumulating over 6,300 minutes, far exceeding the recommended limit of 55 games and leaving him with only a 22-day offseason. The report warns that the demanding modern football calendar, which includes expanded club and international competitions, puts players at significant risk of injury and burnout, and calls for better safeguards to manage their playing time.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich's recent 7-1 loss to Barcelona in the Women's Champions League has intensified concerns that German women's football is falling behind Europe's elite. The defeat has highlighted a broader trend, as no German club has won the Champions League since 2015, and the national team's last major trophy was in 2013. Analysts suggest the German Bundesliga is struggling to compete financially with leagues in Spain and England, leading to a talent drain and questions about whether the domestic league is competitive enough to prepare its top clubs for European success.</p>

          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and facilities, prompting a legal challenge from state and city officials. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to consider a temporary restraining order to block the deployment, which was authorized by the Trump administration. Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson argue there is no crisis justifying the military presence, while the federal government maintains the president has the legal authority to deploy the troops.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the Gaza peace plan, agreed upon by Israel and Hamas, involves the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to a pre-determined line. According to a senior White House official, the Israeli withdrawal would occur within 24 hours of the deal's formal approval, after which Hamas would have 72 hours to release the living hostages. While this marks a significant step, key issues such as the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza have not yet been resolved.</p>

          <p>China has tightened its regulations on the export of rare earths, which are essential for manufacturing many high-tech products, citing the need to safeguard national security. The new rules formalize restrictions on the export of processing technology and prohibit unauthorized collaboration with foreign companies. This move could impact the U.S., which mines rare earths but lacks significant processing capabilities. The announcement clarifies that export licenses are unlikely to be granted to foreign arms manufacturers and some semiconductor firms, a key point of contention in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Italian pasta manufacturers are facing the threat of a new 92% tariff from the United States, sparking fears of a "fatal blow" to their exports. The potential duties stem from a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation into alleged dumping practices by some of Italy's oldest pasta brands, including La Molisana and Garofalo. Producers deny the accusations and worry that the tariffs, which could double the price of their products in the U.S., would make it impossible to compete in a key market. The Italian government is lobbying Washington to reverse the decision.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that children as young as four years old have been found with knives in UK primary schools, based on police data obtained through a Freedom of Information request. In 2024, there were over 1,300 offenses involving sharp objects in schools in England and Wales, with at least 10% committed by primary-aged children. The findings have prompted calls for increased safety measures, with some educational trusts installing permanent metal detectors. The mother of a teenager who was fatally stabbed at school is now advocating for knife arches in all schools.</p>
