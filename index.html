          <p>Japan's population has been declining for 15 years, leading to significant economic and social challenges, including labor shortages and strains on the healthcare system.

          <p>Global military spending reached a new peak in 2024, totaling over $2.7 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the previous year. The surge was driven by the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, with significant increases in Europe and the Middle East. Germany has become the biggest military spender in Western Europe.

          <p>The wreckage of two 18th-century Danish slave ships, Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, has been discovered off the coast of Costa Rica. Marine archaeologists identified the ships, which were wrecked in 1710, through the analysis of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes found during underwater excavations. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. The Danish government banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1792, but the country didn't abolish slavery until half a century later, in 1847.</p>

Research suggests that parents are finding school uniforms increasingly unaffordable, with many believing that branded items are not limited as much as they should be. The bill also proposes to introduce free breakfast clubs, create a register of home-schooled children, and reform academies.</p>
