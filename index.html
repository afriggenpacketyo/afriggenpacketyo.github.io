          <p>Smoke from Canadian wildfires and dust originating from the Sahara Desert are combining to create poor air quality conditions across the eastern United States, stretching from New York City down to Miami.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's proposed budget bill would increase the national deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also projects that the bill would leave 10.9 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034, primarily due to cuts in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans claim the bill will spur economic growth and reduce the deficit, but the CBO's analysis suggests otherwise, highlighting significant reductions in federal spending on Medicaid, food assistance programs, and the Affordable Care Act.

          <p>Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right PVV party in the Netherlands, has triggered a government collapse by withdrawing from the ruling coalition over migration policy. This move has plunged the country into political uncertainty and set the stage for fresh elections. Wilders aims to become the next prime minister by capitalizing on discontent over migration, but faces challenges in building alliances with other parties. His past reputation for walking away from tough situations and the fragmentation of the far-right in Europe could hinder his ambitions.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing figures for her votes on the Supreme Court, particularly in cases where she sided with liberal justices or rejected President Trump's requests. Despite this criticism, Trump has publicly defended Barrett, who has delivered conservative votes on key issues such as overturning Roe v Wade and expanding gun rights. The analysis suggests that while there are rumblings of discontent, Barrett remains a conservative force on the bench, but she is a jurist rather than an activist.</p>
