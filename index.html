            <p>Evangelical leaders are uniting to reclaim the phrase "Christ is King" from far-right and far-left groups who are attempting to distort its original meaning. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) has been tracking the misuse of the phrase by extremist influencers and bot networks, some with connections to the Chinese Communist Party, to spread hate and antisemitism. Religious leaders emphasize that the phrase is meant as a cry of worship and should not be used to promote hate or violence, underscoring the importance of standing with Jewish brothers and sisters against antisemitism. The effort aims to drown out hate with the true Christian message of love and inclusivity.</p>

The intercepts, launched from Malbork Air Base in Poland, were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing mission, marking the RAF's first such actions since arriving in the region to defend NATO's eastern flank alongside Sweden.</p>

German officials defend the deportations, referencing the country's "StaatsrÃ¤son" and responsibility toward Israel, stating that opposition movements will not be tolerated. Critics argue that the concept of StaatsrÃ¤son is a political rather than legal basis for deportation, while supporters emphasize Germany's historical obligations.</p>

            <p>As retirement approaches, it's crucial to protect savings from market volatility caused by events like tariff changes. Experts recommend rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, potentially shifting to a 60/40 stock/bond allocation. Building cash reserves to cover two years of income can help avoid selling investments during market downturns, mitigating sequence of returns risk. Another strategy involves creating a bond ladder to provide a steady income stream and further insulate retirement funds from market fluctuations (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Kansas City, Missouri, a major hub for federal agencies, is experiencing widespread pain from budget cuts ordered by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Thousands of federal jobs are at risk, impacting public health, environmental programs, and social services. The cuts have led to layoffs, reduced funding for community initiatives, and increased strain on local resources, affecting the lives of workers and vulnerable populations. The situation has also sparked protests and political action, including efforts to drive Tesla out of Missouri.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece suggests China should require bilateral trade with the US to be settled in renminbi as a countermeasure to US tariffs. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate, challenging the US dollar's dominance. The author argues that China's manufacturing capabilities support a large trade volume, and mandatory renminbi settlement would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale. A rapid appreciation in the renminbi could signal strong economic fundamentals, encouraging global investors to increase their holdings of renminbi assets.</p>

Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and assaults along the front line, as well as drone strikes. He suggested that Putin either lacks full control over his army or is merely seeking favorable PR coverage. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce for 30 days, emphasizing that their actions would depend on the actual situation on the ground.</p>

Hitler's economic agenda prioritized tariffs to protect German farmers and workers, despite warnings from economic experts about potential trade wars and negative impacts on German industry. The tariffs led to retaliatory measures from neighboring countries and strained trade relations, ultimately foreshadowing his later military aggression.

            <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering a healthcare CEO, has sparked controversy with his online activity, including a review of the Unabomber Manifesto. The manifesto, written by Ted Kaczynski, critiques modern society and technology, resonating with Mangione's apparent resentment towards the US healthcare system. While it's unclear if Mangione was inspired by Kaczynski, parallels exist between their cases, such as targeting corporate executives and creating a media spectacle. The manifesto's enduring appeal stems from its critique of technology and evolutionary mismatch, though it has been appropriated by various groups across the political spectrum.</p>
