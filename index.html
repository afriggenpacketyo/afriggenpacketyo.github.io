          <p>Researchers in China claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a drone swarm. The system can reportedly create an "eye of the storm," a protective electromagnetic null zone for friendly forces, while simultaneously jamming enemy communications. This targeted approach, detailed in a paper from the Beijing Institute of Technology, marks a significant advancement from traditional brute-force jamming methods that disrupt all signals in an area. The technology aims to provide a decisive advantage by neutralizing interference for allies while disabling adversaries.</p>

The bout, which was the first SummerSlam appearance for both competitors, featured a series of high-impact moves and dramatic reversals. After Cargill nearly secured victory with her finisher "Jaded," Stratton managed to get her foot on the ropes to break the pin. Stratton then countered a top-rope maneuver from Cargill to hit her own finisher for the win, extending her title reign.</p>

Despite considering ending his Forget Tomorrow tour upon diagnosis, he decided to continue, stating the joy of performing outweighed the physical stress. Lyme disease, transmitted by ticks, can cause flu-like symptoms, joint pain, and neurological issues but is typically treatable with antibiotics. Timberlake expressed gratitude to his family for their support while noting uncertainty about his future on stage.</p>

The event is described not just as a tragic chapter in the nation's history but as a profound moral wound that continues to shape Chinese national identity and foreign policy. For many, the memory is deeply personal and painful, reinforced by a perception that the Japanese government has never fully acknowledged or atoned for the atrocities committed during the war.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after being detained for two months. She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, leaving behind her husband and two young children, one of whom was an infant she was still breastfeeding. Her detention stemmed from an old deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother missed an immigration hearing years ago. Clouatre is now reunited with her family but must wear an ankle monitor as her case proceeds.</p>

Pirro, a staunch ally of President Trump, had been serving in the role on an acting basis since May. This powerful position oversees a large staff and prosecutes both federal and local crimes in the nation's capital. Her confirmation followed the collapse of a previous nominee's bid and encountered relatively little pushback from congressional Democrats.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has launched an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led two criminal probes into President Trump. The inquiry centers on potential violations of the Hatch Act, a law limiting the political activities of federal employees. The investigation was prompted by a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's push for a "rushed trial" of Trump before the election constituted illegal political interference. Smith, who resigned in January, had previously maintained his actions were not politically motivated.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration has taken an "Orwellian" turn, citing two recent events as key evidence. The first is the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner immediately after the release of unfavorable job numbers, a move the president explicitly linked to his disbelief in the data. The second is the removal of a display referencing Trump's two impeachments from a Smithsonian exhibit on presidential power limits. The author contends these actions are blatant attempts to rewrite history and control narratives, sending a chilling message to impartial government officials.</p>

          <p>Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the world record holder in the 400m hurdles, showcased her remarkable versatility by winning the 400m flat at the U.S. track and field trials. Dominating the race from the start, she clocked a season's best time of 48.90 seconds, securing her spot at the World Athletics Championships in this alternate event. Her victory was a highlight of the trials, which also saw Jacory Patterson, who was working for UPS at the start of the season, win the men's 400m. McLaughlin-Levrone's performance nearly broke the American record set in 2006.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old woman is in stable condition after suffering a medical emergency and receiving life-saving CPR at a Buffalo Bills practice event. According to the Erie County Sheriff's Office, two reserve deputies noticed the woman in distress leaning on a railing at Highmark Stadium.

          <p>Researchers have solved the 80-year-old mystery of what killed "Winston," a platypus gifted to UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill by Australia during World War II. The animal died just days before reaching England, and for decades, it was rumored to have died from shell-shock during an encounter with a German U-boat. However, new analysis of archival records, including the attendant's logbook, reveals the true cause was likely extreme heat. As the ship crossed the equator, temperatures in the platypus's enclosure rose well beyond safe levels, essentially cooking the creature alive.</p>

          <p>Criminal organizations are capitalizing on the massive TikTok-driven popularity of Labubu dolls by flooding the market with dangerous counterfeit versions. Trading Standards officers in the UK have seized thousands of these fakes, which are often poorly made and pose a serious choking hazard to children as small parts easily detach. Authorities warn that these counterfeits, often traced to China, can also be made with toxic materials and banned chemicals. The high demand for the genuine dolls, which sell out in seconds online, has created a lucrative market for criminals producing the unsafe knock-offs.</p>
