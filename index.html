          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher on Monday, with the DAX, CAC 40, and FTSE MIB all showing slight gains, while the UK's FTSE is expected to remain unchanged. This follows a mixed performance in Asia-Pacific markets and a quiet day for European data, though Turkish growth and EU unemployment figures are due. Traders are closely monitoring inflation data and the likelihood of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September, influenced by recent dovish remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. U.S. financial markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of victory in World War II, is expected to feature a wide array of advanced drone systems and 'robobeasts.' Analysts suggest this display will highlight the People's Liberation Army's rapid advancements in integrating autonomous technologies across air, land, and sea operations, signaling a shift towards AI-enabled, multi-domain warfare. Officials have pledged to unveil 'new-domain forces and new-quality combat capabilities,' including previously unseen unmanned systems. While these systems might be presented in mixed formations to reflect real war scenarios, experts anticipate static displays for security reasons.</p>

          <h2>UK Immigration Debate: Goalposts Shift as Opponents Remain Unappeased</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 01:00:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the debate around UK immigration is characterized by constantly shifting goalposts, suggesting that no policy, including Brexit's end to free movement, will satisfy those demanding stricter controls. It draws parallels with escalating crackdowns in the U.S., where immigration enforcement has expanded to militaristic levels, leading to fear among both documented and undocumented residents. The author contends that the focus often shifts from border control to internal deportations, creating a perpetual sense of crisis rather than solving a quantifiable problem. The piece suggests that the underlying question is not 'how many is too many,' but 'how few is few enough,' a target that remains unattainable.</p>

          <p>The founder of luxury jewellery retailer Vashi, Vashi Dominguez, is accused of orchestrating a £170 million diamond scam, allegedly instructing staff to pose as customers to deceive investors. The company collapsed in 2023, leaving investors with total losses as a promised £157 million diamond stock was later valued at only £100,000. Despite the scale of the alleged fraud, neither the Metropolitan Police nor the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into Dominguez, who has since disappeared. This article highlights the shock and frustration among investors, who question the lack of official action.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD fell nearly 8% after the company reported a significant 30% drop in net profit for the April-June quarter compared to the previous year. This decline occurred despite a 14% increase in revenue, driven by expanding overseas sales. The article attributes the profitability slump to an intense price war within China's EV industry, which has seen retail car prices fall by approximately 19% over the past two years. Chinese authorities have warned against aggressive price cuts, but competition remains fierce as automakers expand globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with a private survey showing the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 50.5, surpassing economists' estimates and indicating the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was partly driven by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting resilience in external demand despite tariffs. However, gains in overall output and new orders were muted, implying limited improvement in domestic demand. While business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector remained weak, with businesses reducing jobs for the fifth consecutive month. The article cautions that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and domestic demand recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

While the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has narrowed the technological gap with the U.S. military, Washington is increasingly leveraging its 'exorbitant privilege' in the global financial system as an economic weapon. The U.S. combines its technological lead and large consumer market to create strategic choke points against rivals. This dual-front approach signifies a shift in the nature of superpower competition, where economic leverage is as crucial as military might in shaping global security.</p>
