          <p>House Republican leadership faces significant challenges in passing President Trump's major legislative package after it narrowly cleared the Senate. Several conservative members have publicly opposed the Senate's version, citing a higher price tag and a larger debt ceiling increase than the bill the House originally passed. With a razor-thin majority, Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford a few defections, and potential attendance issues due to weather could further complicate the vote ahead of the July 4th deadline. The internal party divisions highlight the difficult path for the president's signature policy agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London's Heathrow Airport is contemplating legal action against National Grid following a report that attributed a major fire and subsequent airport shutdown to a known fault at an electrical substation. An investigation revealed that National Grid was aware of a moisture issue affecting electrical parts since 2018 but repeatedly deferred maintenance, leading to the blaze. The power failure caused thousands of flight cancellations and significant financial losses for the airport and airlines. Energy regulator Ofgem has launched its own investigation into the incident and National Grid's maintenance practices.</p>

The cuts are spread across various teams and regions and are part of an effort to reduce layers of management between executives and individual contributors. This move follows several other rounds of layoffs at the company over the past year. Despite the workforce reduction, Microsoft recently reported strong quarterly profits and revenue, driven by growth in its cloud and software services.</p>

The princess emphasized that recovery is a "rollercoaster" and not a smooth process, requiring time to find a "new normal."

This forecast highlights Beijing's significant progress in its strategic push for chip self-sufficiency, even amidst ongoing technology restrictions from the United States.

State officials argue this action creates a climate of fear that will deter vulnerable populations from seeking necessary medical care.

The job losses were concentrated in service-providing sectors like professional services and health, while goods-producing roles saw a modest increase.

          <p>As President Trump's massive budget bill returns to the House, significant disagreements between Republican factions threaten its passage before a July 4 deadline. Key sticking points include the bill's projected addition to the national deficit, which fiscal conservatives find unconscionable, and the depth of cuts to social programs like Medicaid. Moderates from swing districts are concerned about the impact of healthcare cuts on their constituents, while a debate over state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps also divides the party. These internal battles create a highly uncertain path for the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has emphasized the strategic importance of China's marine economy, calling for stronger policy support to accelerate its "high-quality development." In 2024, the sector's GDP surpassed 10 trillion yuan, contributing nearly 8% to the national total, a milestone the government considers a remarkable achievement. This focus reflects decades of investment in marine industries, which are now seen as crucial for the country's overall economic strategy. The government's push is expected to benefit various sectors related to marine resources, transportation, and technology.</p>

          <p>A new analysis argues that the major legislative bill backed by President Trump, while not explicitly about technology, could undermine the U.S. artificial intelligence sector. Provisions in the bill would cut funding for clean energy sources like wind and solar, which are crucial for powering the energy-intensive data centers required for AI development. Additionally, cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and food stamps are seen as unprepared for potential job displacement caused by automation.

          <p>The mayors of Baltimore, Chicago, and Columbus are suing the Trump administration over new rules that shorten the enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and impose stricter verification checks. The lawsuit alleges that these changes create unlawful barriers to healthcare, will result in more uninsured residents, and overburden city services. The administration argues the new rules are necessary to prevent fraud and safeguard the program's future. This legal challenge follows a period of record enrollment under previous, more lenient rules, and comes as Congress considers legislation that could further reduce ACA participation.</p>

During their set, the lead singer led the crowd in chants of "death, death to the IDF," which drew widespread condemnation, including from the UK's prime minister. The BBC, which broadcast the set, also faced criticism and expressed regret for not cutting the live stream. In response, the band stated they were being targeted for speaking up and were not calling for the death of any group of people, but for the dismantling of a "violent military machine."</p>

          <h2>U.S. Halts Shipment of Some Air Defense and Precision Weapons to Ukraine</h2>

          <p>The White House has confirmed a freeze on the shipment of some air defense and precision-guided weapons to Ukraine, a decision made after a review of U.S. military stockpiles. The move was framed as putting "America's interests first," but it has sparked concern in Kyiv, which warned that any delay in support only encourages Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials stated they had not received formal notification and were seeking clarification. The pause comes as Russia intensifies its aerial attacks on Ukraine and follows a period of wavering U.S. commitment to long-term aid for the war effort.</p>
