        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food insecurity is intensifying in rural America, exemplified by a Missouri food bank seeing double the demand. Rising inflation and over $1 billion in federal food aid cuts have strained resources for non-profits like Harvesters, which feeds nearly 375,000 people daily across Kansas and Missouri. The situation is exacerbated by the Trump administration canceling a key USDA report on food insecurity, leaving organizations without vital data. Many struggling citizens urge politicians to address the crisis rather than engage in partisan bickering, highlighting the severe impact on daily lives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea has kept its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, primarily due to persistent concerns over household debt. This decision follows new, stricter property regulations in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing and cooling the housing market, which has seen prices accelerate despite previous measures. The central bank also faces uncertainty regarding trade relations with the U.S., particularly a $350 billion investment deal that South Korea fears could trigger a financial crisis if fully transferred in cash. The article highlights the complex economic challenges facing South Korea. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated her department is "not yet fit for purpose," echoing a critical internal report that revealed dysfunction and detachment from core functions. The report, commissioned in 2022, cited a "culture of defeatism" on immigration, a backlog of 166,000 asylum cases, and chronic data and technology problems. Mahmood, who recently took office, pledged to transform the Home Office, asserting it had been "set up to fail" under the previous government. This mirrors a similar declaration made by a former Labour Home Secretary two decades prior, which led to significant reforms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has removed its Human Rights Reporting Gateway, an online portal allowing the public to report alleged human rights violations by foreign military units receiving American arms. Human rights campaigners and a senior congressional aide criticized the move, stating it undermines transparency and legal requirements for gathering such information. Critics argue the deletion, part of a broader State Department reorganization under the Trump administration, weakens the government's ability to deter abuses and hold perpetrators accountable. The article notes that without this vital channel, the U.S. risks supporting forces that commit serious abuses without proper oversight.</p>

          <h2>New Clinical Trial Shows Promise in Preventing Breast Cancer Recurrence by Targeting Dormant Cells</h2>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are conducting a clinical trial targeting "sleeper cells" to prevent breast cancer recurrence, particularly in aggressive forms like triple-negative breast cancer. These dormant cells can break away from primary tumors and cause cancer to spread later. In a trial of 51 women, only two experienced recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate. This innovative approach offers hope for patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who underwent treatment to eliminate detected dormant cells. The next steps involve larger trials and exploring applicability to other cancer types.</p>

          <p>Lebanon is experiencing the world's fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality, with new cases rising by 162% and deaths by 80% since 1990. Factors contributing to this alarming trend include severe air pollution from vehicles and generators, overuse of agricultural chemicals, and widespread smoking. Despite available screening, public health education is lacking, leading to late detection of preventable cancers. A global survey highlighted Lebanon's crisis, prompting parliamentary discussions on improving health screening, banning public smoking, and launching anti-tobacco campaigns.</p>

          <p>New port fees enacted by the Trump administration's U.S. Trade Representative have unexpectedly burdened Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a U.S.-based ocean carrier, with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill. The company was reclassified under new Section 301 program terms, leading to charges based on net tonnage capacity rather than cargo type. ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, expressed shock, stating the unique hybrid vessel classification unfairly targets his company, which primarily carries containers. He warns that these tariffs could force ACL to relocate operations, impacting U.S. importers and exporters who rely on their specialized service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) asserts that England's support system for children with special educational needs (SEND) is fundamentally flawed and requires a major overhaul. The report advocates for more comprehensive support in mainstream schools, accessible without lengthy assessment processes, as the number of pupils with Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) has doubled since 2016. It highlights cases like Evie, who struggled to find suitable education due to complex needs, and Betsey, who was late-diagnosed with autism. The Department for Education acknowledges the "vicious cycle" and promises reforms, but critics stress the urgency for increased funding and better local authority responsibility.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated these sanctions are crucial to pressure Moscow and curb its war funding, expressing hope for a swift withdrawal if Russia agrees to peace.

The automotive sector last contracted in 2020, and expiring government incentives are identified as the primary reason for this pessimistic forecast.

          <p>New Jersey's Attorney General has sued Amazon, alleging the company discriminated against thousands of pregnant employees and staffers with disabilities in its state facilities. The lawsuit claims Amazon violated anti-discrimination laws by placing workers on unpaid leave, denying reasonable accommodations, and retaliating against those seeking accommodations, sometimes leading to termination for failing to meet productivity targets. Amazon denies the accusations, stating it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and does not automatically place pregnant workers on leave. The state seeks compensatory damages, civil fines, policy adjustments, and five years of monitoring for the company.</p>
