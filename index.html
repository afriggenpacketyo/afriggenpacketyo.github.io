          <h2>US-UK Trade Deal Eases Some Tariffs, Falls Short of Comprehensive Agreement</h2>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade agreement with the UK, rolling back some import taxes on cars and steel in exchange for increased access for American beef and ethanol. While Trump hailed the deal as a "breakthrough," analysts noted its limited substantive benefits, with goods from the UK still facing higher tariffs than before recent announcements. The agreement drew criticism from American carmakers and muted responses from farmer groups, reflecting its narrow focus and potential political motivations. Overall, the article suggests the deal offers a political victory for Trump with limited economic impact, indicating a pattern of prioritizing deal-making over substantive changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump appointed Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., after withdrawing Ed Martin's nomination due to Senate Republican pressure. Pirro, a former Republican district attorney, is a staunch Trump supporter known for her aggressive defense of him on television and her propagation of false statements about the 2020 election. The move raises legal questions about Trump's appointment powers and could face legal challenges, potentially disrupting criminal cases or expanding presidential authority. Fox News announced Pirro's immediate departure from the network following the appointment, marking the end of her 14-year tenure there.</p>

          <p>China's recent stimulus package, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, has failed to boost its stock market, as investors remain concerned about economic deterioration and trade talks with the U.S. While the measures align with economic priorities outlined at last month's Politburo meeting, analysts view them as a stopgap rather than a solution. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more targeted at industrial and social needs, rather than directly supporting stock markets. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and prop up the real estate sector for a meaningful market rally.</p>

While some employees have retired or been criminally charged, a significant number are still employed by Amtrak.

          <p>Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, advocating for the start date to be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism and challenge the "Western-centric" view. The proposal comes as countries globally commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end. President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow, marking Nazi Germany's surrender to the Soviet Union in 1945.</p>

          <p>A federal class-action lawsuit accuses UCLA's medical school of using race as a factor in admissions, despite state law and Supreme Court rulings against affirmative action. The lawsuit, brought by activist groups, alleges that the associate dean for admissions requires applicants to provide information revealing their race and that admissions committee members openly discuss and use race in their decisions. The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny of UCLA and other UC campuses for potential "illegal DEI" in admissions practices by the Trump administration. The lawsuit claims that Black applicants with lower GPA and MCAT scores are routinely admitted, while white and Asian applicants require near-perfect scores.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain, increasing market access for American farm exports in exchange for arrangements like allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10% tariff. The agreement maintains a 10% baseline tariff on most goods but removes additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. While many details are still being worked out, the deal signals Trump's intent to maintain the universal tariff while negotiating country-specific tariffs.

          <p>President Trump has proposed a tax hike on wealthy Americans, specifically those earning over $2.5 million annually, as part of an upcoming fiscal package. This move would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts and has sparked debate among Republicans. The proposed tax increase aims to offset spending cuts to Medicaid and address concerns about the optics of benefiting the rich while cutting benefits for the poor.

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported a disappointing first quarter due to inclement weather, but promising signs of a stronger second quarter boosted investor confidence. Despite missing earnings expectations, revenue exceeded estimates, and comparable store sales showed positive growth. The company's average weekly sales reached all-time highs in March, and comparable sales increased 5% year-over-year in the first five weeks of the second quarter. However, an increase in the full-year commodity cost inflation outlook has led to a reduced price target, though the brand's value and customer experience position it well to navigate economic challenges.</p>

Cork camogie player Ashling Thompson stated that her team will wear shorts in the upcoming final, even if it risks the game being abandoned.

          <p>The acquittal of three former police officers in the state trial over the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols has sparked outrage and renewed debate about police accountability. The jury's decision to acquit the officers on all charges, including second-degree murder, contrasts with the video evidence of the beating. The defense successfully shifted blame, emphasized the dangers of policing, and secured a jury from outside Memphis, raising concerns about impartiality. The verdict adds to a mixed record of outcomes in cases against police officers since George Floyd's death, highlighting the challenges of proving unlawful use of force.</p>
