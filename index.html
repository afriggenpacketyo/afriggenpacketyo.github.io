          <p>Federal authorities report that two suspects involved in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing utilized a generative AI chat program to assist in planning the attack. Guy Edward Bartkus, the primary suspect, allegedly researched explosives using ammonium nitrate and fuel through the AI application. This marks the second instance this year where law enforcement has highlighted the use of AI in aiding bombing attempts, with a previous case involving a soldier using ChatGPT to plan an attack on a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Tech companies are facing scrutiny for potentially taking shortcuts in safety testing their AI models before public release, raising concerns about the responsible use of AI technology. The article emphasizes the need for robust safety evaluations and security measures to prevent misuse of AI. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and urging Americans to tell lawmakers to "kill the bill."

Frederiksen argued that high migration levels threatened social cohesion and welfare, justifying stricter rules.

Research indicates that the earnings gap between college graduates and high-school graduates has remained consistent since 2010.

          <p>Egypt's foreign minister has assured Greece that Egypt will preserve the spiritual and religious value of Saint Catherine's Monastery, a site significant to the Greek Orthodox church. This reassurance follows an Egyptian court ruling that raised concerns about the monastery's ownership claims. The court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites in the area. Greece and Egypt have agreed to collaborate to protect the monastery's rights and legal status, recognizing its enduring value as a place of Greek Orthodox worship.</p>

          <p>A proposed restructuring plan for Voice of America (VOA) could lead to the firing of nearly all of its employees. Under the plan, only 18 employees would remain at the federally funded news agency. VOA was originally founded in 1942 to combat Nazi propaganda. The potential mass layoffs raise concerns about the future of the agency and its ability to fulfill its mission.</p>

Critics argue the protections could harm steel producers outside the US, provoke retaliation from trade partners, and significantly increase costs for American users of the metals. Some firms directly affected expressed disbelief the plan was moving forward, hoping it would be temporary.
