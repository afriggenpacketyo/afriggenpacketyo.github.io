          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has repeatedly refused to disclose the source of a "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a contentious television interview, Pulte argued that revealing his sources would be reckless and compromise whistleblowers, shifting focus to the alleged crime rather than the investigation's origins. This stance comes amid accusations of political weaponization, as President Trump has moved to fire Cook based on these allegations while seeking to influence the central bank's interest rate policies. Pulte denied any political motivation for his public campaign against Cook.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic accident involving Lisbon's historic Elevador da Gloria funicular has resulted in the deaths of 16 people and left approximately 21 others injured. The streetcar derailed from its tracks on a steep hill and crashed into a building in the city's center, a popular area for tourists. Officials have reported that about half of the injured were foreign visitors, prompting a national day of mourning in Portugal. An investigation is now underway to determine the cause of the disaster, with initial speculation pointing towards a potential failure of the main cable.</p>

          <p>Leaders in the sports betting industry are forecasting unprecedented levels of wagering for the upcoming NFL season, citing strong momentum and resilient consumer spending. CEOs from DraftKings and BetMGM reported record numbers and significant growth in pre-season activity, suggesting the sector is behaving in a contrarian manner amid broader economic concerns. The American Gaming Association projects that legal betting in the U.S. will increase by 8.5% to $30 billion this season. The industry is also navigating the emergence of new competition from sports prediction markets, which operate similarly to stock trading.</p>

Senator Tina Smith criticized his unsubstantiated claims linking psychiatric drugs to a recent school shooting, while Senator Bernie Sanders challenged his assertion that major medical organizations are corrupted by the pharmaceutical industry. The hearing highlighted the deep divisions over Kennedy's leadership and his skepticism of established medical institutions, which has drawn significant controversy and calls for his resignation from critics.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has significantly expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides flood forecast visualizations for areas covering 60% of the U.S. population. This interactive online tool offers near real-time, neighborhood-level projections of floodwaters, aiming to improve communication between forecasters, emergency managers, and the public. The expansion now includes regions in the Great Plains, Southeast, and West Coast, as well as Hawaii and parts of Alaska. The system has already proven effective in facilitating timely evacuations, and it is expected to be fully operational nationwide by next year.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman convicted in 2010 of murdering her husband, is facing a second trial after her initial conviction was overturned. The case centers on a 2007 house fire from which her husband, Todd Stermer, escaped only to be run over by a van driven by his wife. While Linda Stermer claims it was a tragic accident as she tried to get help, prosecutors and her own sons believe she intentionally set the fire and killed him. After a federal judge overturned her life sentence due to prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel, she now faces a new jury.</p>

This legal action follows President Trump's deployment of hundreds of troops as part of a crackdown on crime, a move that Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized as costly and unnecessary despite some reported decreases in certain crime rates.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, the Irish comedy writer known for creating "Father Ted" and "The IT Crowd," is on trial in London, accused of harassing a transgender activist. Prosecutors allege that Linehan used social media to "relentlessly" post offensive messages about Sophia Brooks, a trans campaigner, and also damaged her phone during a confrontation. Linehan has pleaded not guilty, claiming his posts were in the public interest to expose the tactics of trans activists. The trial is separate from his recent arrest at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence, which is still under investigation.</p>

          <p>The government of Nepal has ordered its telecommunications authority to block access to major social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, X, and LinkedIn. The move comes after these companies failed to meet a deadline to register with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and appoint local representatives. This action is part of a broader government crackdown aimed at curbing what it describes as the spread of misinformation and cybercrime. Digital rights advocates have criticized the sudden shutdown, calling it a controlling measure that infringes on the public's fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles has cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. Newsom characterized the deployment, which began in June, as "costly political theater," with expenses covering payroll, food, travel, and logistics for over 4,200 soldiers. This financial disclosure follows a federal judge's ruling that barred the soldiers from participating in immigration arrests. Newsom's office is now seeking a court injunction to block an extension of the deployment for the 300 troops who remain in the city.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the idea of transforming anxiety from a debilitating condition into a source of personal growth and adventure, drawing on the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard. While acknowledging that anxiety disorders are a serious mental health issue, the author argues that managed anxiety can be beneficial, raising performance and promoting self-knowledge. Research suggests that moderate levels of anxiety can lead to peak performance states known as "flow." The article proposes a two-step approach: first, accepting anxiety as a normal alert system, and second, reframing the physiological response not as dread, but as evidence of an exciting opportunity.</p>

The court heard that Hopper, who had performed hundreds of amputations, used ice and dry ice to self-inflict severe frostbite on his own legs, leading to their necessary amputation below the knee in 2019. He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers by attributing the injuries to sepsis.
