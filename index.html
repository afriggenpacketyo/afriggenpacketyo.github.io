          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated he will not speak with Elon Musk and threatened Musk with consequences if he funds Democratic candidates. Trump claimed he gave Musk "breaks" during his first administration, suggesting he saved Musk's businesses. When asked about investigating Musk's business dealings or immigration record, Trump said there have been no discussions. The former president's remarks come amid escalating tensions between the two figures. Optimism is not particularly high given the nature of the dispute and the potential ramifications for Musk's businesses.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk appeared to delete several posts on X that were critical of former President Donald Trump, including one insinuating Trump was in the Epstein files. Musk had posted, without evidence, that the Department of Justice hasn't released its files into its investigation of Jeffrey Epstein because Trump is in them. Trump dismissed Musk's claims as "old news" and expressed disappointment in the criticism, threatening to cut federal contracts to Musk's businesses. Vice President JD Vance said Musk's accusation is "absolutely not" true, adding that he hopes Musk "comes back into the fold."</p>

          <p>A U.S. travel ban imposed by the Trump administration is expected to severely impact Haiti, a country already struggling with widespread gang violence. The ban is likely to affect sick children, families, and businesses in Haiti, cutting off a vital lifeline. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges faced by Haiti and the potential consequences of the U.S. policy. The article suggests a pessimistic outlook for the people of Haiti given the already unstable conditions and the additional burden of the travel ban.</p>

          <p>England completed a comprehensive one-day international series clean sweep over the West Indies with a nine-wicket victory in a rain-affected match at Taunton. Set a target of 106 in 21 overs, England cruised to victory, led by captain Nat Sciver-Brunt's unbeaten 57. The West Indies struggled, slipping to 4-3 early on, and despite a brief recovery, could only manage 106-8. England's summer continues with T20s and ODIs against India, which presents a relatively positive outlook for English cricket fans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed cut of $4 billion for California's high-speed rail project is likely to cause significant delays in serving the first passengers. Analysts suggest that the project, already facing numerous challenges, will be further hampered by the loss of federal funding. The decision raises concerns about the future of the ambitious infrastructure project and its potential impact on California's transportation network.

          <p>Sir David Attenborough has described the damage to the world's oceans as "unspeakably awful" in an interview with Prince William, ahead of a UN Oceans conference. Attenborough specifically criticized certain fishing methods, like bottom trawling, for their devastating impact on marine life. The UN aims to get the High Seas Treaty ratified by 60 countries to protect 30% of the ocean, but scientists worry MPAs won't be effective if practices like bottom trawling are still allowed within them. The interview underscores the urgency of addressing threats to the oceans from plastic pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to a large egg recall has sickened dozens of people in seven states, leading to hospitalizations. The August Egg Company recalled about 1.7 million brown organic and cage-free egg varieties due to potential salmonella contamination. The CDC advises people to throw away recalled eggs or return them to the store, washing and disinfecting any surfaces that came in contact with the eggs. This is the latest in a string of salmonella-related outbreaks involving food, raising concerns about food safety.</p>
