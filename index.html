        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the tragic death of their brother Michael from carbon monoxide poisoning due to a leaking exhaust in his car, Lucy and Rebecca Barnard are campaigning for carbon monoxide detectors to be legally required in all UK vehicles. They have launched a petition to raise awareness of the dangers of the gas, which claims about 60 lives in the UK annually. The sisters emphasize the importance of this issue, especially since car exhausts are only checked for carbon monoxide emissions during MOT tests, potentially missing leaks within the car itself. The sisters hope their efforts will prevent similar tragedies in the future, even if it saves just one life.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, ending escalating tensions that followed an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, as announced by Pakistan's Foreign Minister and confirmed by Indian officials. President Trump initially revealed the agreement on social media, stating the US mediated the talks. Secretary of State Rubio confirmed that Vice President Vance and he engaged with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker the ceasefire. The agreement comes after days of cross-border fire and strikes, with both sides accusing the other of provocations and misinformation, though Indian officials deny any damage to military infrastructure.</p>

Ukraine's foreign minister stated that Ukraine and its allies are ready for a ceasefire on land, air, and sea for at least 30 days, starting on Monday, contingent on Russia's agreement and effective monitoring. The visit underscores Europe's commitment to Ukraine after more than three years of war with Russia, and the leaders laid flowers at a memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers.

The failures, attributed to staffing shortages, underinvestment, and outdated equipment, have caused significant flight delays. Transportation Secretary Duffy has unveiled a plan to replace dated radar and communications systems across U.S. airspace, potentially requiring over $30 billion in funding from Congress. The FAA plans to increase staffing at the Philadelphia facility and install a temporary backup system to improve reliability, while airlines are considering flight cuts at Newark to ease the strain.</p>

The rivalry between India and Pakistan centers on the Kashmir region, which has been a point of contention since the partition of India in 1947, with both nations claiming the entire territory but controlling only parts of it.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing increasing pressure to cut interest rates, with some critics arguing that the Fed is historically slow to act and risks being "too late" in responding to economic challenges. Despite calls for rate cuts from President Trump, Powell has voiced confidence in the economy and dismissed the idea of pre-emptive cuts, citing a lack of urgency. However, concerns persist about the potential impact of tariffs on growth and inflation, leaving Powell in a difficult position with threats to both sides of the Fed's mandate. Many economists think that Powell should do nothing now, but some are concerned that the Fed's caution could lead to a recession.</p>

It contends that ensuring economic and societal support for people's decisions about having children is crucial and should not be surrendered to culture wars. The author suggests that policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare could align with progressive priorities and potentially increase birth rates.

          <p>A spear tip carved from bone, discovered in Russia in 2003, has been dated to 80,000 years old, indicating it was crafted by Neanderthals rather than modern humans. This finding suggests Neanderthals had advanced bone-working techniques beyond simple stone tools, independently developing technologies previously attributed only to Homo sapiens. The discovery adds to growing evidence that Neanderthals possessed sophisticated skills and cognitive abilities. The exceptional preservation conditions in the Mezmaiskaya Cave allowed for the long-term survival of the bone tool, providing valuable insights into Neanderthal technology.</p>

The therapy, developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals, essentially allows a patient to be their own stem cell donor, making it safer than a bone marrow donation. All nine patients in the trial, including the Langenhop children, produced healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections, and none have had severe infections since their treatment. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are thriving and living normal lives, and the therapy is now under review with the FDA.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to pass crypto legislation are being undermined by concerns that his personal cryptocurrency ventures create conflicts of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill, due to concerns about Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Democrats introduced the "End Crypto Corruption Act" to prevent elected officials from issuing or endorsing digital assets, while some senators expressed concerns about anti-money laundering and national security. The president's pursuit of personal profits is creating a major impediment to long-awaited advancements in the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>A fire at an industrial estate in Vilanova i la Geltrú, Spain, caused a toxic cloud of chlorine, leading authorities to confine approximately 160,000 people to their homes. The fire, which originated at a swimming pool cleaning products firm, prompted a large deployment of fire service units to monitor and manage the situation. The order was lifted after authorities determined the fire was stabilized and the toxic cloud began to dissipate. No casualties were reported as a result of the incident.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how employers are increasingly hiring part-time workers to avoid paying benefits and overtime, leading to a situation of underwork for many Americans. This practice, driven by just-in-time scheduling, creates unstable incomes and makes it difficult for workers to access social safety net programs or hold down a second job. The author argues that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which set limits on how many hours an employer could demand, needs to be updated to address the problem of underwork. The article suggests policies like requiring employers to set schedules in advance or allowing hourly workers to choose between part-time and full-time work.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is celebrating a "standstill commitment" from the German domestic intelligence agency (BfV), which temporarily puts the agency's official reclassification of the AfD as a right-wing extremist party on hold. The AfD claims this as a victory and a step towards exoneration, but the BfV maintains its classification is correct and has only suspended the designation to allow the court time for review. Legal experts emphasize that the "standstill commitment" is a routine administrative procedure and does not indicate a change in the BfV's assessment or the AfD's prospects in the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean after being stranded in Earth's orbit for 53 years. The event is a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved several milestones in exploring Venus. The re-entry highlights the increasing frequency of objects falling from the sky due to the growing number of launches, though most go unnoticed. The event also serves as a reminder of the vast amount of space debris still orbiting Earth from the early days of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping's strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how is facing challenges as trade tensions with the US escalate. China has ramped up exports, deepened its position as a manufacturing base, and introduced new economic warfare tactics like export controls. However, this approach has worsened frictions with trading partners and comes at a cost to Chinese households. While China has weaponized its supply chain, it still relies on the West for advanced technologies, and the trade war could result in millions of lost jobs.</p>

Baldoni claims Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Swift were present to serve as her "dragons" during discussions about script changes.

          <p>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is implementing a unique approach to evaluating rookie talent at the team's minicamp, focusing on individual drills rather than 11-on-11 periods to assess players' raw abilities. The goal is to identify "rare gems" by providing a fair competition and evaluating each player's pure talent, he said. The coaching staff will teach drills directly related to the Chargers' scheme and evaluate each prospect compared to his counterparts. This system is intended to provide a clearer view of each player's capabilities and potential fit with the team.</p>
