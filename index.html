          <p>This article discusses whether prospective borrowers should rush to open a home equity line of credit (HELOC) before the May Federal Reserve meeting. It notes that HELOCs have variable interest rates that adjust monthly, so locking in a low rate isn't urgent. The article suggests HELOCs are currently the cheapest borrowing option and a smart way to finance home projects, potentially becoming even cheaper with future rate cuts. It advises researching lenders and rate offers but cautions careful borrowing due to the home serving as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson warns that foreign investors are losing faith in the U.S. due to concerns about tariffs and the potential weaponizing of capital markets. Based on conversations at World Bank and IMF meetings, she contends investors are gradually reducing exposure to U.S. assets, potentially leading to a significant capital outflow. Even a small reduction could cause problems for U.S. markets, as investment committees may take months to implement a shift of capital back to home markets or into new opportunities like gold. This could result in a slow bleed of support out of the U.S. markets. (not investment advice)</p>

Barak believes that eroding the boundaries between academic and political spheres harms both, contributing to a decline in public confidence in universities.

However, the index is still below its February high, and companies are struggling to forecast future earnings due to trade policy uncertainty. While some tariffs have been paused, new taxes on imports, including auto parts, are expected to take effect, potentially slowing economic growth and raising consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho state trooper, was found guilty of second-degree murder and domestic battery in the death of his wife, Kendy Howard. Kendy was found dead in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head, initially dispatched as a suicide. However, clues at the scene, such as a packed duffle bag and warm towels in the dryer, raised suspicions. Prosecutors argued that Dan killed Kendy by putting her in a carotid restraint hold, while the defense maintained her death was a suicide.

The film is praised for its cinematography, which captures the stark beauty of the natural elements, but the reviewer finds the central relationship and overall storytelling somewhat lacking.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $6 billion cut to NASA's budget, while redirecting $1 billion to Mars-focused missions, aligning with SpaceX's ambitions. The proposed budget emphasizes beating China back to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars. NASA would need to streamline its workforce, terminate missions, and reduce scientific activities for fiscal responsibility. This includes retiring the SLS rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the Gateway programs, as well as ending green aviation spending and the Mars Sample Return Program.</p>

The NCA is a comprehensive report on the impacts of climate change in the United States, and its models are used to estimate future impacts.

Public health experts are concerned that this approach could undermine confidence in vaccines.
