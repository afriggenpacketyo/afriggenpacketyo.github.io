          <p>The Senate's latest version of President Trump's legislative package includes last-minute changes that have stunned the clean energy industry. The bill now phases out clean energy tax credits more rapidly than expected and introduces new taxes on wind and solar projects, while simultaneously adding new support for fossil fuels like coal. Tesla CEO Elon Musk called the bill "utterly insane," and industry groups warned the changes could strand billions in investments and lead to higher utility costs for consumers.
