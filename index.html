          <p>The European Union has warned it may withdraw from trade negotiations with China due to a lack of meaningful progress, according to the EU's ambassador to Beijing.

The ambassador emphasized that the high-level economic dialogue, scheduled before a summit in Beijing, is unlikely to proceed without tangible outcomes.

          <p>A growing number of Japanese Gen Z workers are embracing 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal interests and work-life balance over traditional career ambitions. A study reveals that 45% of Japanese workers aged 20 to 59 admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to adopt this approach. This shift in attitude reflects a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the long working hours and sacrifices made by previous generations.

          <p>Advocacy groups are warning that proposed Republican cuts to food and health benefits will have severe consequences for low-income Americans. The cuts are part of a larger bill aimed at advancing Trump's legislative priorities, including border security and tax cuts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cut billions from Medicaid and food assistance programs, while increasing the national debt. Critics argue these changes would disproportionately harm the poorest Americans, forcing families to make difficult choices between food, housing, and healthcare.</p>

          <p>OpenAI employees are reportedly frustrated by the company's restrictions on donating equity to charity, despite the company's soaring valuation. Employees receive profit participation units (PPUs) that can't be transferred without company approval, limiting their ability to donate equity via donor-advised funds (DAFs). This issue has been a topic of discussion at OpenAI, but the company has prioritized other matters, such as funding rounds and for-profit conversion. While OpenAI has partnered with Dechomai as its donor-advised fund, employees await further opportunities to donate, as they believe that donating to charity is a great opportunity not only for their charitable giving impulses but also for their taxes.</p>

          <p>The article examines the 'Wages for Housework' movement of the 1970s, which advocated for government pay for unpaid domestic labor. It argues that the movement's ideas, though radical, offer a potential solution to declining birth rates and the devaluation of care work. The author contrasts this approach with right-wing pronatalist policies that simply 'glorify motherhood' without providing material support. The article also discusses the movement's utopianism and its failure to achieve tangible victories, while emphasizing its important understanding of women's needs and the need for economic freedom.</p>

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening to strike after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems 'derisory' and insufficient to reverse historical pay freezes. The BMA argues that doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago, accounting for inflation. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) may also dispute the government's commitment to fully funding a 4% pay rise for teachers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offers, stating they were above inflation, but unions remain concerned about the impact on service provision and job losses.</p>
