            <p>A Chinese official has condemned countries attempting to appease the United States in trade negotiations, responding to reports that the US plans to pressure nations to restrict trade with China in exchange for tariff exemptions. The spokesperson warned against appeasement, asserting that it cannot bring peace or earn respect, and urged all parties to defend international economic and trade rules. This comes amidst increasing trade tensions and tariff impositions by the Trump administration on Chinese imports, as well as other countries, leading to concerns about the stability of the multilateral trading system. The official cautioned against the risk to all countries once international trade returns to the "law of the jungle."</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has offered Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro a prisoner swap, proposing to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the US and imprisoned in El Salvador in exchange for the release of an equal number of political prisoners held in Venezuela. Bukele also mentioned nearly 50 prisoners of other nationalities, including US citizens, as part of the proposed swap. The offer comes after the US deported over 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, and pays El Salvador to detain them. Maduro has condemned the US deportations, while Venezuela's chief prosecutor criticized Bukele's proposal.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, focusing on stabilizing the yuan amid trade tensions with the U.S. This decision follows better-than-expected economic data from China, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter. The PBOC's move aligns with economists' expectations and reflects its cautious approach to monetary policy in the face of external pressures. The 1-year LPR influences corporate and household loans, while the 5-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal attorney. The messages, sent on March 15, allegedly included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets. This revelation follows a previous incident where Hegseth inadvertently shared similar operational details in a separate Signal chat that included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, sparking concern over how senior officials handle sensitive military information. The Pentagon has defended Hegseth, stating that no classified information was shared in any Signal chat.</p>

Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed grave concerns about Hegseth's ability to maintain trust and called for an investigation by the Department of Defense's Office of the Inspector General into Hegseth’s handling of classified information. Reed stated that Hegseth must explain why he reportedly texted classified information on a commercial app that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer.</p>

            <p>An analysis of HBO's "The Last of Us" Season 2 argues that while the show was initially praised for expanding on the video game's storytelling, recent plot detours and increased brutality have diminished its emotional impact. The extended sequence depicting Joel's death, for example, is criticized for sacrificing the shock of the game for a more predictable narrative. The show's focus on pain and fractured bonds, while thematically relevant, has resulted in a more circular and suffocating storytelling experience compared to Season 1's exploration of connection in impossible circumstances.</p>

This situation highlights the potential disruption to aircraft deliveries caused by changing tariffs, with some airline CEOs considering deferring deliveries rather than paying the duties.

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," nonsexual unions driven by practical advantages like social security benefits, are gaining traction, particularly among those whose sexual orientations don't align with traditional marriage norms. These arrangements, exemplified by couples like Satsuki and Minato, offer partnership without romantic or sexual expectations, appealing to individuals seeking companionship and societal acceptance. While some view these marriages as a desperate measure due to the lack of legal recognition for same-sex unions, they reflect a broader trend of diverse values and evolving family structures in Japan, where traditional love marriages may also transition into more practical partnerships over time.</p>

            <p>Defense secretary Pete Hegseth is in the spotlight for a communications blunder in which he reportedly created his own Signal group chat that included his wife and brother, in which he shared confidential details of a US strike on Yemen this March. The chat on Signal, a commercially available app not authorized as a means to communicate sensitive or classified national defense information, allegedly included more than a dozen people. President Trump downplayed the first incident, describing it as “glitch”.</p>

            <p>A Texas man was sentenced for trafficking vulnerable Mexican baby spider monkeys into San Diego and selling them on Facebook. Sarmad Ghaled Dafar, 33, received four months in custody and 180 days of home confinement for trafficking six young primates. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uncovered his crimes in 2023 when they intercepted three baby Mexican spider monkeys that had been smuggled across the border in Calexico by someone working for him. The three confiscated monkeys — named Chrissy, Jack and Janet — were temporarily quarantined at the San Diego Zoo and have since been permanently housed at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's escalating trade war with the United States may ultimately make China faster, leaner, and stronger. The author suggests that China recognizes America's strategic goal is to strangle its economic rise, not merely rebalance trade. To counter this, China could use fiscal stimulus in the near term, but the real key is resolving its own economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market. Rather than relying on brute strength, China can leverage its inner balance and core strength to overcome the challenges posed by the trade war.</p>

            <p>Despite government efforts to expand access to free childcare in England, parents continue to face challenges in finding nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. While the rollout of the "free hours" scheme aims to provide 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents, experts are concerned about widening gaps between those who qualify and those who miss out. Private nurseries, which provide most early years places, are facing rising operating costs, while local authority-run nurseries are declining. The government is doubling spending on childcare, but the system is under strain and needs more staff and places to work effectively.</p>

            <p>A recent study reveals that men go to the doctors less than women, are less likely to be registered at a dental practice, and rarely use a pharmacy, which impacts their health outcomes. Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and "rarely or never" used a pharmacy, too. The study suggests that societal pressures to "tough it out" and concerns about appearing weak contribute to men's reluctance to seek medical help. The NHS survey suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.</p>
