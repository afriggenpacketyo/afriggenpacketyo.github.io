          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have secured their 13th consecutive playoff berth following a victory over the San Francisco Giants. The game was particularly significant as it marked the final regular-season home appearance for veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who recently announced his retirement. While the team has guaranteed a postseason spot, tying the second-longest streak in MLB history, they still need to clinch the NL West division title. Kershaw, a future Hall of Famer, expressed excitement for the team's championship prospects, regardless of his role in the playoff rotation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has introduced new rules for journalists at the Pentagon, requiring them to sign a pledge restricting their movements and agreeing not to gather any information not officially authorized for release. This policy, which threatens revocation of press passes for non-compliance, has been criticized by press freedom advocates as a form of prior restraint and an assault on independent journalism. The move follows other restrictions on media access implemented by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and comes amid broader administration criticism of news organizations. These actions have raised significant concerns about government transparency and First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally disruptive qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, while championship rivals Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris of McLaren qualified in seventh and ninth respectively after both encountered issues. The session, which lasted two hours, was marred by numerous crashes, including from Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the final segment. Light rain added to the treacherous conditions, making it one of the most unpredictable qualifying events in recent memory.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England, including shows in Boston and Connecticut, after receiving a credible death threat. The threat was reportedly made online before a performance in Ottawa, Canada, leading to the arrest and charging of a 26-year-old man. The Boston venue, MGM Music Hall, confirmed the cancellation was made out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the artist and his band. Morrissey, the former frontman of The Smiths, has assured fans that all tickets for the affected shows will be fully refunded.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new policy imposing a $100,000 annual fee per worker for H-1B visas, a program heavily utilized by the technology and finance sectors for highly skilled immigrants. The sudden announcement has caused major tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft to advise their visa-holding employees to remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel. Foreign governments, particularly India, have expressed concern over the potential disruption and humanitarian consequences for families affected by the new rule.

          <p>The fate of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's show remains unresolved as discussions continue with Disney and ABC executives regarding his potential return to the air. "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" was suspended indefinitely after Kimmel made remarks linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to President Trump's MAGA movement. The suspension has drawn widespread debate, with pressure from the FCC, criticism from conservatives, and protests in support of Kimmel from free speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and even some Republican politicians. Major station groups have also preempted the show, leaving its future contingent on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations.</p>

The project features creative elements such as Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk supports, fulfilling a long-held creative vision for the homebuilder. Aided by his partner, musician Jenny Kimmel, Saunby is turning the remnants of destruction into a testament to resilience and resourcefulness.</p>

This led to long queues and hundreds of delayed flights, with passengers reporting hours-long waits and missed connections.

          <p>The release of Apple's new, thinner iPhone Air is emblematic of a pervasive and, in the author's view, uninspiring trend toward minimalism in technology, design, and culture. The article argues that this aesthetic of scarcity, seen in everything from interior design to theater productions, strips away character and context in favor of a clean, unobtrusive, and ultimately hollow experience. The author contrasts the new iPhone with the colorful, maximalist iMac of the late 1990s, suggesting that modern minimalism is a form of control that masks a chaotic world. This design philosophy, while appearing restrained, is seen as a dishonest reflection of our increasingly complex lives.</p>

          <p>The killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is being framed by the Trump administration as a pivotal moment to justify a crackdown on political opponents, according to critics and political analysts.

This response is seen by some experts as a classic authoritarian tactic, using a tragedy as a pretext to suppress dissent and erode civil liberties.

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indices achieved record closing highs this week after the Federal Reserve announced its first interest rate cut since last December. The central bank reduced its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, signaling the possibility of two additional cuts in the coming year. This move, which puts the federal funds rate in a range of 4% to 4.25%, was highly anticipated by investors and fueled a rally in the market. The article also notes that market focus will now shift to upcoming employment data and the next Fed meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to stop U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant, utilizing new powers gained from the company's recent acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. After the steelmaker notified nearly 800 workers of the impending closure, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company that the administration would not permit it. This marks the first use of a "golden share" right, a condition of the takeover deal that grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. U.S. Steel subsequently reversed its decision, ensuring the facility will remain operational. (not investment advice)</p>

Lewinsky emphasized the importance of telling her own story to counteract the politically motivated narrative created about her, and she expressed gratitude to younger generations who viewed her situation with more empathy.

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked hopes for increased stability in the relationship between the two nations. Following what both sides described as a productive conversation, Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a potential visit to China early next year. However, analysts remain cautious, pointing to significant points of friction such as tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Potential U.S. tariffs related to China's purchase of Russian oil also pose a risk to the positive momentum.</p>

          <p>The United States has become noticeably quieter about sending its warships through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office, with only three known operations occurring compared to the regular announcements under the previous administration. Beijing has historically criticized the "public hype" surrounding these freedom-of-navigation exercises. While the U.S. has confirmed the recent transits when asked by the media, the shift away from proactive announcements is seen by some Chinese observers as a tactical change rather than a substantive shift in U.S. policy.

          <p>A leading dermatologist is highlighting a common misconception about sun protection, warning that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur even while indoors. Dr. Adam Friedman explains that while windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays. These UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, accelerating aging and contributing to skin cancer risk without any visible burning sensation. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially for those who spend extended time near windows, to protect against this "silent" form of skin damage.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing increasingly expensive grocery bills, with food prices rising at their fastest monthly rate since 2022. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a shortage of farm workers in the U.S. Tariffs have particularly impacted the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production. These compounding pressures are passed on to consumers, leading many to change their shopping habits to cope with the higher costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark short-term interest rate, longer-term rates, including those for mortgages, have paradoxically increased. While the stock market rallied on the news of the Fed's quarter-point reduction, bond traders reacted differently, selling off long-term bonds and driving their yields higher. Analysts suggest this is because easing monetary policy while inflation remains above target raises concerns that the Fed may be losing focus on controlling inflation, a key risk for long-duration bonds. This dynamic has immediate consequences for consumers, as higher long-term yields translate into increased costs for mortgages and other loans. (not investment advice)</p>
