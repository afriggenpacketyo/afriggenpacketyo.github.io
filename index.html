          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack, to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had announced their detention and processing for removal proceedings. Soliman, an Egyptian national, faces multiple charges, including a federal hate crime, for allegedly attacking marchers supporting Israeli hostages. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine" and "End Zionist" during the attack. The judge set a hearing for June 13 to consider a temporary restraining order, ensuring the family remains in the country while the case proceeds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested the FDA to review the latest data on mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortions. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, prompted by concerns raised in a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Experts argue that concerns about mifepristone's safety are misguided, citing that some described "adverse events" are normal occurrences during medication abortions. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge targeting the pill's availability in 2024, preserving access to the drug. The FDA has maintained that mifepristone is safe and effective based on thorough reviews since its initial approval in 2000.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions as president, claiming that Biden's aides masked the Democratic president’s cognitive decline. Trump questioned Biden’s use of an autopen to sign pardons and other documents, suggesting that some of Biden’s actions are invalid because his aides were usurping presidential authority. Trump has directed Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and David Warrington, the White House counsel, to handle the investigation. Numerous US media outlets and a recent book co-authored by Jake Tapper have revealed that top Democrats and people in Biden’s inner circle also had serious misgivings about his ability to do the duties of president.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women to stop using weight-loss injections if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding, as it is not known whether the medicines could harm an unborn baby. The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. The UK drugs regulator, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese, the MHRA says.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is reducing its collection of consumer price data. Officials claim the cutbacks will have minimal impact, but economists warn of reduced confidence in inflation data produced by a struggling statistical system. The changes raise concerns about the accuracy and reliability of economic indicators. The move comes amid ongoing debates about the best ways to measure and understand inflation.</p>

          <p>Two men suspected in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing used a generative artificial intelligence chat program to help plan the attack, according to federal authorities. Records from an AI chat application show Guy Edward Bartkus, the primary suspect, researched how to make powerful explosions using ammonium nitrate and fuel. This marks the second case this year of law enforcement pointing to the use of AI in assisting with a bombing or attempted bombing. The incident has spurred debate about the safety testing of AI models before their release to the public.</p>

The White House defended the bill, asserting it improves the fiscal trajectory of the United States.

While the college wage premium remains high, it has stopped widening in recent years, and the value of college for lower-income students has declined. Skepticism about college is also rooted in broader political views and a lack of faith in institutions.</p>
