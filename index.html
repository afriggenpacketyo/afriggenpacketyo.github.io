          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that she declined U.S. President Donald Trump's offer to deploy American troops into Mexico to assist in combating drug trafficking. Sheinbaum emphasized that Mexico's sovereignty is not negotiable, highlighting a potential point of contention between the two nations despite existing cooperation on immigration and trade. Trump's administration has been increasing military presence along the U.S.-Mexico border and designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, and Sheinbaum stated that cooperation is possible, but each country must operate within its own territory. The White House National Security Council affirmed Trump's close collaboration with Mexico while underscoring the ongoing threat from foreign terrorist organizations and the need for Mexico to intensify its efforts against these groups.</p>

          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's child population has decreased for the 44th consecutive year, reaching a new record low of 13.66 million as of April 1, with the ratio of children to the overall population falling to 11.1 percent. Despite government initiatives to combat the declining birth rate, such as financial assistance and expanded daycare services, the trend persists, with the child population decreasing in all 47 prefectures. This long-term decline highlights Japan's ongoing struggle to reverse its demographic challenges, as the country's child population has been falling continuously since 1982 after peaking in 1954.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that there has been no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and expressed his hope that such a need will not arise. Putin affirmed that Russia possesses the strength and means to bring the conflict in Ukraine to a "logical conclusion" that meets Russia's requirements. Despite expressing willingness to negotiate a peace settlement, Putin reiterated Russia's determination to achieve its objectives in Ukraine, where Moscow's forces currently control approximately 20% of the country. Fear of nuclear escalation has been a factor in U.S. officials' thinking since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022.</p>

          <p>The death of Kendy Howard, initially reported as a suicide, is being investigated after first responders noted several inconsistencies at the scene. Kendy's husband, Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, called 911 claiming his wife shot herself in the bathtub, but investigators found broken glass, discarded clothing, and warm bathwater, which seemed unusual. A load of laundry in the dryer, started just a minute before the 911 call, also raised suspicions. Investigators are exploring a theory of how Dan Howard could have killed his wife, leading to his arrest in April 2023 and subsequent trial for murder.</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was arrested for the murder of his wife, Kendy Howard, two years after her death was initially reported as a suicide. Kendy had told Dan she wanted a divorce just days before her death, and clues at the scene, such as a packed duffle bag and a running dryer, raised suspicions among investigators. Kendy's daughter accused Dan of the murder, and prosecutors built a case leading to his arrest in July 2023.

          <h2>Baby Food Pouch Hysteria: A Critique of Maternal Guilt and Food Politics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 03:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches and ultra-processed foods (UPFs), arguing that it is another way of making mothers feel guilty. The author, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, points out that the focus on personal responsibility overlooks broader social, political, and economic factors that influence food choices. Cosslett argues that the criticism of convenience foods like pouches is often weaponized in ways that disproportionately impact women, particularly working mothers, and fail to account for structural inequalities of class, gender, race and disability.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is no longer seen as a wild notion after Reform UK's recent electoral successes, according to Laura Kuenssberg. This article suggests that Reform's performance in recent elections has shaken the central dynamic in British politics, with the possibility that Farage's party could replace the Conservatives in the medium term. As a result, both Labour and the Tories are now in a race to prove their ability to govern effectively and address public disillusionment.</p>

The gene therapy works by modifying the patient's own cells to help them create the missing protein needed to help the body fight infection, giving the boy a working immune system. The success of the trial opens doors for gene therapy to be used in a number of conditions, including cancer and muscular dystrophy.</p>
