          <p>The Trump administration's August 1 deadline for implementing new global tariff rates is approaching, creating economic uncertainty as many countries have yet to secure a deal. While agreements have been reached with nations like the UK, Vietnam, Japan, the EU, and South Korea, key trading partners including China, India, Canada, and Mexico still face the prospect of higher duties. The article details the status of negotiations, noting that countries without a specific agreement could be subject to a new baseline tariff of 15-20%. The administration's actions aim to reshape global trade but have fallen short of its initial deal-making targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. imposing 25% tariffs, India has not expedited efforts to secure a trade agreement, prioritizing the protection of its domestic agricultural sector. Indian officials stated they are not negotiating based on deadlines and are confident a favorable deal can be reached later, protecting the interests of farmers who represent a significant voting bloc. Analysts suggest the U.S. has a strategic interest in not alienating India, viewing it as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. This geopolitical positioning gives New Delhi leverage in the ongoing trade discussions with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has revised its forecast, now expecting U.S. trade tariffs to cost the firm approximately $2 billion in the current year, an increase from previous estimates. The automaker has already incurred $800 million in extra duties in the last quarter, primarily due to higher-than-expected tariffs on goods from its facilities in Mexico and Canada, as well as levies on imported steel and aluminum. Despite manufacturing most of its vehicles in the U.S., the financial impact is significant, highlighting the broader effect of the administration's trade policies on major American corporations.

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal that sets a blanket tariff of 15% on South Korean exports, including automobiles, avoiding a threatened 25% rate. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for Korean companies to enter the U.S. market in sectors like shipbuilding and semiconductors. While the deal provides some stability, interpretations of the investment fund differ between the two nations. The agreement notably excludes further concessions on sensitive agricultural products like beef and rice, which was a key objective for Seoul. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twelve employees of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) are facing disciplinary action, including termination, following allegations of a retirement party involving alcohol and a hired stripper during work hours. The incident allegedly took place at a Caltrans yard in Monterey, with a tipster reporting that some supervisors consumed alcohol before driving state-issued vehicles. Caltrans launched an immediate investigation and has placed the employees on administrative leave. The agency stated that the alleged behavior is a serious violation of its values and ethical standards and that it is committed to holding those involved accountable.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping, alleviating initial concerns of a more serious injury. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani appeared uncomfortable on the mound before being removed, but he remained in the game as the designated hitter. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, with their only scoring coming from a two-run homer by Freddie Freeman. Ohtani, who is still building up his pitch count after returning from surgery, is expected to make his next scheduled start.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's trade policies reveals significant impacts on the U.S. and global economies. The average U.S. tariff rate has reached its highest point in nearly a century, leading to a tripling of monthly tariff revenues for the government. However, this has not reduced the trade deficit, which widened as companies stockpiled goods to avoid the taxes. While Chinese exports to the U.S. have fallen, the article notes that consumer prices for certain imported goods in America are beginning to rise, suggesting the economic consequences are now being felt by the public.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains between 4.25% and 4.5%, though the decision was not unanimous, with two board members voting for a reduction in a rare dissent. The Fed's cautious approach comes amid economic uncertainty fueled by new trade tariffs and mixed economic data. While policymakers have indicated a rate cut is likely this year, they remain concerned about the potential effects of new fiscal policies and inflation, which remains above their target.

          <p>Following a major earthquake in Russia that triggered tsunami alerts, this article explains the science of how these powerful waves are generated and what to do in an event. Tsunamis are typically caused by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that create vertical movement on the seafloor, displacing a massive volume of water. The resulting waves can travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean before slowing and growing in height as they approach the coast. Experts emphasize that even small tsunamis are dangerous and advise immediately moving to higher ground, at least 100 feet above sea level, upon receiving a warning.</p>

The Chinese-led team observed abundant ecosystems fueled by chemical seepage from the Earth's crust, including beds of clams, bacterial mats, and fields of tube worms. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme high-pressure, pitch-black environments. The discovery suggests that such chemosynthetic communities may be more widespread in the planet's deepest trenches than previously believed, opening new avenues for scientific research.</p>

While many studies link screens to negative outcomes, some researchers point out flaws in the data, such as reliance on self-reporting and a failure to distinguish between different types of screen use. They argue that the term "screen time" is too broad and that the focus should be on specific online harms rather than general usage.

The high-resolution scans revealed intricate designs of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures on the woman from the ancient Pazyryk culture, showcasing a level of sophistication that would challenge a modern tattooist. Researchers worked with a specialist in ancient tattooing techniques to analyze the images, concluding that the decorations were likely stenciled and applied with multi-pointed tools.
