          <p>Frances Lee, a professor at Princeton, discusses her book, *In Covid's Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us*, which analyzes the political system's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The article highlights the departure from pre-existing pandemic plans, the lack of a scientific basis for some measures, and the challenges of cost-benefit analysis in policymaking. Lee argues that health officials were often intolerant of criticism and that there was a disjunction between what officials said in private and in public, such as the claim that vaccines would prevent transmission. She emphasizes the importance of acknowledging uncertainty and resisting moralized antagonism in policymaking, as well as confronting the limits of our knowledge.</p>

          <p>Following local elections, Reform UK has gained control of several local councils and mayoralties, signaling a shift in British politics. Nigel Farage, the party's leader, aims to implement efficiency measures inspired by Donald Trump's "Doge" initiative, focusing on slashing council spending and prioritizing essential services. The party plans to resist central government efforts to accommodate asylum seekers in their areas, while acknowledging the inexperience of newly-elected councillors and promising training through their Centre for Excellence. Concerns have been raised about potential cuts to essential services in the pursuit of savings, as well as the practicality of preventing asylum seeker accommodation.</p>

          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not agree to a trade deal with the U.S. unless all new tariffs are reviewed, including those on automobiles and auto parts. This comes after the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on auto parts, prompting disappointment from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Japan insists on negotiating with the U.S. on all tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum, emphasizing the protection of its national interests in the tariff talks. The U.S. has also announced reciprocal tariffs, but the extra portion for Japan is currently on hold.</p>

          <p>In a BBC interview, Prince Harry expressed his desire for reconciliation with the Royal Family, revealing that his father, King Charles, is not speaking to him due to security concerns. Harry stated that he is "gutted" about the lack of contact between his children and the wider family in the UK, and tired of only returning home for funerals and court cases. He called on his father, the prime minister, and the home secretary to intervene in the security dispute, suggesting that the Royal Household has used security as leverage. Buckingham Palace responded by stating that the issues have been examined repeatedly by the courts, with the same conclusion reached each time.</p>

The man, who had previously been warned for stalking the 20-year-old victim, returned to Japan from overseas. The police found a bag containing human remains under the floorboards during a search of his house, and autopsy findings revealed signs of burning and that her death occurred more than a month prior.

          <p>Early vote counting in Australia's general election indicates the ruling center-left Labor Party is likely to secure a second term. The Australian Electoral Commission's projections show Labor with a significant lead in the House of Representatives, although some contests remain volatile. Key issues in the campaign have been energy policy and the cost of living crisis, with the opposition blaming government waste for inflation. The Labor Party has criticized the opposition for mimicking U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, while also highlighting improved relations with China under their leadership.</p>

          <p>A York MP is advocating for a modern approach to the ban on alcohol consumption in football stands, citing legislation from 1985 aimed at curbing hooliganism. Luke Charters argues that the ban creates an inconsistency compared to other sports where fans can drink freely. He suggests trialing the consumption of alcohol in view of the pitch, similar to a trial in the women's game, initially in the lower leagues, while maintaining family zones where it would be inappropriate. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's comments and would welcome trials in the men's game.</p>

A study tracked 18 axolotls released into both artificial and restored wetlands, discovering that they gained weight and successfully avoided predators. This suggests that reintroduction efforts can be successful if water conditions are ideal, and that axolotls can adapt to man-made habitats. The exotic aquatic critters are also a favorite among medical researchers, who hope that the amphibians' extreme regenerative abilities could eventually help doctors better treat catastrophic injuries in people.</p>

This development could potentially alter the dynamics of electronic warfare, as LPIR is widely used in US air and missile defense systems and stealth aircraft.</p>

He criticizes the Trump administration's attempts to control universities and emphasizes the need for universities to protect their independence and resist government intrusion. The author says that universities at their best will at times serve, like the press, as the public’s check on government, but they will also serve as a check on the public itself.</p>

          <p>This article provides financial advice on various topics, including managing premarital debt, dealing with financial difficulties in retirement, and understanding the tax implications of required minimum distributions. The advisor recommends addressing premarital debt before marriage, as it can impact joint finances and borrowing power. For an 82-year-old widow with significant debt, bankruptcy is suggested as a potential solution. The article also clarifies that withdrawals from retirement plans do not directly reduce Social Security payments, but can make more of the payment taxable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are causing anxiety among truck drivers and port workers in Southern California, who fear a decline in cargo volume and job losses. With tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, the flow of goods into the U.S. is expected to slow, impacting the livelihoods of those who move cargo through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Union leaders and business owners express concern about the potential for empty shelves, rising prices, and increased unemployment, while agricultural exporters fear the effects of retaliatory levies on overseas markets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to defund Alhurra, a U.S.-government-funded Arab-language news channel, has sparked debate about the role of U.S. soft power in the Middle East. While some mourn the loss of a pro-American voice in the region, others criticize Alhurra's unclear mandate, low viewership, and alleged corruption. The shutdown has left hundreds of journalists jobless and uncertain about their immigration status, with questions raised about the use of remaining funds. Launched in 2004, Alhurra struggled to gain traction and faced criticism for being a mouthpiece of the American administration.</p>

          <p>A former federal prosecutor, Adam Schleifer, claims that "smears" originating from Andrew Wiederhorn, the former CEO of Fat Brands, reached the White House and contributed to his dismissal. Schleifer alleges that Wiederhorn and his defense team spread attacks through conservative pundits, leading to his firing shortly after a right-wing activist publicly called for it. Schleifer, who had been prosecuting Wiederhorn on federal charges, claims he was fired for his "engagement in constitutionally protected political activity." Wiederhorn, who has maintained his innocence, faces charges related to a $47-million “sham loan” scheme and illegal firearm possession.</p>

          <p>Women in the Bay Area are leading the nation in delaying motherhood to pursue careers and other aspirations, according to recent data. Marin County and San Francisco have the highest proportion of women giving birth at 40 and older, attributed to economic opportunities, progressive social norms, and access to reproductive technology. Many women in the region prioritize career advancement and life experiences before starting a family, with fertility clinics reporting a high number of patients over 38.

This situation has angered those who took the offer out of fear of job elimination, as they are now being paid to stay home while their positions are being advertised. The government will effectively be paying two salaries for the same job through September, raising questions about the rationale behind the agency's workforce reduction strategy and the use of taxpayer funds.</p>
