          <p>GE Vernova has announced a $41 million investment to expand its generator manufacturing operations at its Schenectady, New York facility. This move aims to increase production capacity for its heavy-duty gas turbines, which are in high demand due to the significant energy consumption of new AI data centers. The investment is expected to create 50 new jobs and help alleviate supply constraints, as the company's gas turbines are reportedly sold out for the next several years. This expansion addresses the urgent need for more power-generating capacity to support the ongoing AI infrastructure boom. (not investment advice)</p>

This demand follows accusations from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has requested a Department of Justice investigation into Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. Pulte claims that Cook falsified documents to secure more favorable loan terms on properties in Michigan and Georgia. The situation is part of a broader pattern of the Trump administration targeting political opponents with allegations of financial misconduct.</p>

          <p>Even as mortgage rates have declined to a 10-month low, many potential home buyers remain on the sidelines due to persistent housing market challenges. Record-high home prices and a severe lack of available inventory have created a significant affordability crisis across the United States. According to the National Association of Realtors, first-time buyers now constitute the lowest share of the market on record. Many prospective buyers are waiting for both prices and interest rates to fall further, contributing to a housing lock-in effect and delaying a key financial milestone for a generation of Americans.

The hearings follow a recent resentencing that changed their original sentence of life without parole to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible. The brothers have maintained they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, a claim prosecutors have disputed but which has garnered support from family members. Separately, they are pursuing a new trial based on new evidence, including abuse allegations against their father from a third party.</p>

          <p>The immigrant truck driver accused of causing a crash that killed three people in Fort Pierce, Florida, failed English language and road sign tests administered by investigators. According to the Department of Transportation, Harjinder Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2018, correctly answered only two of twelve verbal questions and identified just one of four highway signs. The case has highlighted issues with the issuance of commercial driver's licenses and has sparked a political dispute between federal officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom's office over responsibility for the driver's work authorization.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military is calling up approximately 60,000 reservists in preparation for a major ground offensive aimed at capturing all of Gaza City. The plan, approved by the Defence Minister, is expected to involve ordering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians to evacuate to southern Gaza. This move comes after ceasefire negotiations with Hamas stalled and has drawn condemnation from international allies and humanitarian organizations, who warn of a catastrophic impact on the region's civilian population.

The verdict was delivered at Inner London Crown Court following a trial where Brain faced numerous allegations of abuse from members of the church group he led.

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of U.S. adults who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low in the survey's nearly 90-year history. This decline is accompanied by a significant shift in public perception, with a record 53% of adults now believing that even moderate drinking is detrimental to health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. The trend is most pronounced among young adults, who are increasingly skeptical of alcohol's purported benefits and are drinking less frequently.

Reflecting on her career, Kvitova expressed contentment with her achievements, which include 31 titles and a career-high ranking of world No. 2. She acknowledged that a horrific knife attack in 2016, which severely injured her playing hand, marked the beginning of a 'second career' and required immense mental fortitude to overcome.

          <p>Homeowners with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOC rates are variable and typically tied to the prime rate, a cut in the federal funds rate usually translates to lower interest charges. However, experts caution that the timing of this relief depends on the lender's adjustment schedule, which can be immediate, monthly, or quarterly.

          <p>Some farmers in Florida are significantly reducing their crop production due to a severe labor shortage driven by fears of deportation under the Trump administration's immigration policies. Agricultural workers, many of whom lack legal status, have either left the state or are in hiding, leaving farmers unable to find enough labor for planting and harvesting. Despite paying above minimum wage, farmers report little interest from American-born workers. The situation has prompted agricultural leaders to warn that the U.S. could become dangerously dependent on foreign countries for its food supply if the labor crisis is not addressed.</p>

          <p>The transfer of convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell to a minimum-security prison in Texas has generated significant controversy and criticism. The move to a facility known for its less stringent conditions occurred shortly after she met with a Justice Department attorney, fueling speculation about a potential deal. Critics, including former prison officials and attorneys for her victims, have called the transfer 'unheard of' for an inmate convicted of such serious sexual offenses. The decision has been described as a slap in the face to victims and part of a broader effort to prevent full public disclosure about Jeffrey Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>Food and non-alcoholic drink prices in the UK rose by 4.9% in the year to July, marking the highest rate of food inflation since early 2024. This rapid increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including extreme weather and drought conditions that have led to poor crop yields both domestically and abroad. Global events, such as the war in Ukraine, continue to disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of essentials like animal feed. Additionally, rising labor and energy costs are squeezing businesses, forcing them to pass on the increased expenses to consumers, who are already facing a cost-of-living crisis.</p>
