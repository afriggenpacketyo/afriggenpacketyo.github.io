            <p>Malaysia is preparing to repatriate giant pandas Fu Wa and Feng Yi to China as their current conservation agreement concludes. A new 10-year agreement has been signed, coinciding with Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit, ensuring that Malaysia will host another pair of pandas from 2025 to 2035. Fu Wa and Feng Yi have begun a quarantine process at the Giant Panda Conservation Centre in Kuala Lumpur's National Zoo to ensure their health and acclimatization before their departure, however visitors will not be able to see the pandas up close during this period.</p>
