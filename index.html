          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a significant drop, falling to their lowest level since 2021, as President Trump's global tariffs heightened concerns about a potential recession. The decision by OPEC+ to increase production hikes further contributed to the downward pressure on oil prices. While Trump touted lower oil prices as a positive outcome of his policies, worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, slowing down economic activity and ultimately hurting demand for oil. JPMorgan has raised its odds of a recession this year to 60% following the tariff rollout.</p>

          <p>A group of universities within the Big Ten Academic Alliance are contemplating establishing a "Mutual Defense Compact" to collectively oppose the Trump administration's policies affecting higher education. This initiative aims to pool legal and policy resources to challenge actions perceived as threats to academic freedom and institutional integrity. The resolution comes in response to the administration's scrutiny of universities receiving federal funding, particularly regarding DEI initiatives and alleged civil rights violations. Critics view the compact as a politically partisan effort to maintain control over the university environment, while proponents argue it is a necessary defense against governmental overreach.</p>

Analysts suggest that Bitcoin is behaving increasingly like a risk-on asset, moving in tandem with equities, and is currently testing critical support levels.

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4% despite concerns that President Trump's tariffs could slow down economic growth. Investors are grappling with the potential impacts of the tariffs, which have sparked fears of a global trade war and retaliatory measures from major trading partners. While Trump has downplayed the effects of tariffs, investors are raising their expectations for lower Federal Reserve rates due to the anticipated economic weakness. Some analysts suggest that international investors may view the U.S. as less of a safe haven amid the tariff uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court to block a lower court order mandating the return of a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that the Maryland judge lacked the authority to issue the order and that U.S. officials cannot compel El Salvador to comply. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, is being held at a maximum security prison in El Salvador. The government alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyer denies.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met as new tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Israel and other countries were about to take effect. The White House abruptly cancelled a scheduled press conference ahead of Netanyahu's arrival. The two leaders were expected to discuss Israeli military operations in Gaza and the new tariffs. The U.S. is set to impose tariffs on imports from Israel, adding to the economic uncertainty.</p>

The administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, despite denials from his lawyers and a lack of evidence presented in court. The official asserted that the administration is following due process in every case, but that the process differs when dealing with members of terrorist groups.</p>

          <p>Restaurant stocks experienced a decline due to investor concerns about a potential recession and the impact of President Trump's tariffs. While the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants is considered manageable, the anticipated inflation is expected to put pressure on consumer spending and industry demand. Shares of Starbucks fell following a downgrade, citing near-term economic headwinds. Trade tensions also pose a risk to Starbucks' international sales, as consumers in China have previously boycotted Western brands for political reasons. (not investment advice)</p>

The firings have led to legal challenges, with claims that the administration is unlawfully punishing employees for their perceived political affiliations.

The direct impact of Trump's tariffs on EU exports to the U.S. is significant, but officials are also bracing for the indirect effect of Chinese goods being diverted to Europe at discounted prices. EU ministers are urging action to protect businesses from Chinese industrial overcapacity, fearing that their economies could be hit on two fronts.</p>

Health officials emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine, which is typically administered as part of the MMR vaccine. The rise in cases is attributed to declining vaccination rates, with data showing a decrease in the percentage of kindergarteners vaccinated against measles in recent years.</p>
