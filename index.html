        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following renewed criticism from Elon Musk regarding a major tax and spending bill, former President Donald Trump suggested that federal subsidies for Musk's companies should be re-evaluated. In a social media post, Trump claimed that ventures like Tesla and SpaceX are heavily reliant on government support and proposed that his Department of Government Efficiency should investigate the matter to save money. This public feud led to a more than 5% drop in Tesla's stock during premarket trading as investors reacted to the potential policy shift.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old British student, Bella Culley, has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in a Tbilisi court, claiming she was coerced through torture. Culley, who is reportedly 18 weeks pregnant, told the judge she was forced to travel with a suitcase containing 12kg of marijuana and 2kg of hashish. Her lawyer stated she was threatened with a hot iron and was unaware of the suitcase's contents, attempting to alert authorities in Thailand before her flight to Georgia. Despite her plea and a bail offer from her family, the court denied bail and remanded her in custody.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new, controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. The center, located at a remote airport, is designed to house up to 5,000 unauthorized immigrants for processing and deportation, with Governor Ron DeSantis highlighting its isolated and unforgiving terrain as a key security feature. The facility's development has drawn protests and a lawsuit from environmental groups, who are demanding an environmental review before it becomes operational.

          <p>Dietitians are highlighting a common breakfast mistake that leads to afternoon cravings for sugary snacks: consuming low-protein, high-carbohydrate meals in the morning. Foods like pastries and sugary cereals cause blood sugar spikes and subsequent energy crashes, leaving people feeling hungry again quickly. Experts recommend starting the day with 20 to 30 grams of protein, which aids in satiety, mood regulation, and sustained energy levels throughout the day. Simple additions like beans, hemp seeds, or Greek yogurt can significantly boost protein intake and help manage appetite.</p>

This significant funding round intensifies the competition in the AI sector, positioning xAI to better challenge industry leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic.

          <p>Senate Republicans have released an updated version of President Trump's major legislative package, which aims to extend the 2017 tax cuts and increase spending on border security and defense. The bill, being advanced through the reconciliation process, includes new restrictions on Medicaid, changes to SNAP food assistance, and an increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000. Key provisions are still being negotiated to secure enough votes for passage, with the Senate parliamentarian striking down some initial proposals. The legislation also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion to avoid a potential default later this summer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The classic childhood pastime of bicycling has seen a significant decline, with the number of children aged 7 to 17 riding regularly falling by nearly half since the 1990s. This trend signifies a loss of more than just a form of exercise; it impacts children's independence, decision-making skills, and spatial awareness. While some blame smartphones, many parents and experts point to increased traffic and larger, more dangerous vehicles as primary deterrents, making streets feel unsafe for unsupervised riding. Revitalizing this activity would require creating safer infrastructure, such as protected bike lanes, to restore a sense of freedom and community connection.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" argues it represents a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, financed by deep cuts to essential social services. The article contends the legislation would make the tax code more regressive, offering substantial breaks to top earners while providing minimal relief to low-income families. These tax cuts are paid for by over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, new restrictions on food assistance programs, and the elimination of green energy incentives. The author asserts that the bill would increase the national deficit and destabilize the healthcare system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over its impact on the federal deficit, some major banks view President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" as a potential positive for the U.S. economy in the near term. Analysts from institutions like Nomura and Citi suggest that by extending the expiring 2017 tax cuts, the legislation would prevent a significant fiscal contraction and could stimulate business investment. However, critics, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, warn that the bill is fiscally irresponsible, projecting it will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt. The American Bankers Association has expressed strong support for the tax relief provisions. (not investment advice)</p>

The Horn of Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable due to existing alliances, such as the cooperation between Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and the al-Shabab militia in Somalia. Experts suggest that a wider conflict could disrupt trade, increase market instability, and divert international attention and resources away from African crises.

The initiative marks a significant step in making private equity more accessible to retail investors, a goal facilitated by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment compared to the U.S. The company also launched crypto staking for Ethereum and Solana domestically for its American users.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted 99-1 to remove a controversial provision from a major Republican spending bill that would have prevented states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. The measure faced strong bipartisan opposition from state officials and governors, who argued it was a gift to the tech industry that would hinder their ability to protect citizens from AI-related harms. Proponents of the moratorium had claimed that a patchwork of state laws could stifle innovation and U.S. competitiveness with China. The removal of the provision marks a significant victory for states' rights and advocates for AI safety.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian long-range drone attack has struck a military factory in Izhevsk, Russia, over 1,000 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, killing three people and hospitalizing 35. Ukrainian officials confirmed that its security service targeted the Kupol Electromechanical Plant, which produces Tor surface-to-air missile systems. This strike demonstrates Ukraine's growing capability to hit strategic targets deep within Russian territory, aiming to disrupt military production and reduce Russia's offensive potential. The attack occurred as peace talks remain stalled, with both sides accusing the other of delaying a diplomatic resolution while continuing military operations.</p>

The policy aims to make China's economy more resilient by prioritizing domestic consumption and standardizing regulations for businesses across the country.

          <p>U.S. consumer spending on most luxury goods fell in the first five months of 2025, but the jewelry category has proven to be a resilient bright spot, according to a Citigroup report. While spending on items like handbags and ready-to-wear clothing has faltered, luxury jewelry sales have consistently increased, surging 10.1% year-over-year in May. Analysts suggest this outperformance is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, its sentimental value, and the recent run-up in gold prices. In contrast, other luxury categories have struggled, facing challenges from significant price hikes without corresponding increases in product innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

This perspective aligns with a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are both implementing AI to boost efficiency and conducting layoffs.

          <p>An opinion article argues that Iran's recent conflict with Israel has exposed the limitations of its strategic alliances and could inadvertently encourage other nations, particularly in Asia, to pursue nuclear weapons. The analysis contends that despite its alignment with China and Russia, Iran was left vulnerable and unable to effectively deter or retaliate against Israeli strikes without its own credible nuclear deterrent. This perceived failure of conventional alliances to provide security may bolster arguments in countries like Japan and South Korea for developing their own nuclear capabilities, raising fears of a new arms race.</p>

          <p>A long-forgotten novel written in 1932 by the acclaimed German journalist and historian Sebastian Haffner has become a bestseller nearly a quarter-century after his death. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was penned when Haffner was a 24-year-old law trainee in Berlin, just as the Nazi party was rising to power. The manuscript was discovered by his son in 1999 but was only recently published, topping German bestseller lists within a week.
