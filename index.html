          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a key Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least 25 deaths and 800 injuries, with six people still missing. The blast caused widespread damage, affecting nearby buildings and vehicles, with residents reporting feeling the impact from as far as 50km away. Initial reports suggest the explosion was linked to improperly stored flammable materials or solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, leading to a spreading fire among containers. Investigations are ongoing, and schools and offices in the region have been closed as a precaution, following warnings about chemical storage at the port.</p>

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, was convicted of murdering his wife, Amy, after investigators discovered suspicious internet searches on his work computer prior to her death. These searches included inquiries about household poisons, overdoses, and gunshot residue testing. The prosecution argued that Fanion's searches, combined with his affair and the lack of gunshot residue on Amy's head, indicated premeditation. Fanion's defense countered that the searches were related to safety concerns and that Amy's death was a suicide, however, the jury ultimately found him guilty, leading to a life sentence.</p>

          <p>A letter penned by Titanic passenger Colonel Archibald Gracie days before the ship's sinking has sold for £300,000 at auction. The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the day he boarded the ship, contains a poignant reference to awaiting his journey's end before judging the vessel. The handwritten note was purchased by an anonymous buyer at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Wiltshire, far exceeding its expected value. The content of the letter has been described as "prophetic" due to its reference to the ship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to review a case involving Trina Martin, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by FBI agents in 2017, causing significant trauma to her and her family. The agents, searching for a suspected gang member, broke down Martin's door and pointed guns at her and her boyfriend, only to realize they had the wrong address. The case raises questions about the extent to which individuals can sue the federal government for law enforcement misconduct, with Martin's lawyers arguing that Congress intended to allow such lawsuits and that denying them would leave families without recourse.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating placing caps on the number of international students as a measure to alleviate its housing affordability crisis, marking a significant shift from its previous embrace of international education. Politicians argue that limiting international student numbers will reduce demand for housing and lower prices, despite concerns about the economic impact. This move is driven by voter concerns over housing affordability, leading to a debate about balancing economic benefits with social challenges. Some argue that focusing on improving selection criteria for international students would be a more effective approach than implementing blanket restrictions.</p>

          <p>Canada's election campaign has experienced a remarkable turnaround, with the Liberal party gaining ground after the resignation of Justin Trudeau and the rise of Mark Carney. The resurgence is largely attributed to the return of Donald Trump to the White House, prompting voters to seek stability and a strong leader to navigate U.S. relations. Carney is positioning himself as the candidate best equipped to handle Trump's protectionist policies and threats, while the Conservatives are struggling to adapt their message in response to the changing political landscape. The election is likely to be won by the party able to convince voters they have a plan for how to deal with the US president.</p>
