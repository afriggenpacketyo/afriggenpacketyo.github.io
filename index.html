          <p>A federal jury in New York delivered a split verdict in the trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, finding him guilty on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution but acquitting him of more severe charges like racketeering and sex trafficking. The decision followed a seven-week trial that included graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse, coercion, and drug-fueled sex parties. Combs, who will remain detained until his October sentencing, reacted with visible relief to the major acquittals but was startled by the guilty verdicts. His lawyers have vowed to continue fighting for his complete freedom, framing the day as a significant step in the right direction.</p>

          <p>South Korea's major K-pop entertainment companies are strategically shifting their focus towards live concerts to counteract a significant downturn in physical album sales that has impacted their revenues. This pivot has proven successful, with world tours by superstar groups like Blackpink and Seventeen generating hundreds of millions in revenue and driving a surge in stock prices for agencies such as Hybe and YG Entertainment. Industry analysts suggest this trend underscores the critical importance of cultivating globally appealing artists, though they also caution against the risks associated with over-reliance on a small number of top-tier acts for financial stability.

          <p>Amid a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote in the U.S. House of Representatives has become a relevant concern for passing legislation. According to House rules, unlike the Senate where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, a tie in the lower chamber results in the automatic failure of the motion or bill being considered. This procedural reality means any measure requires a true majority to pass, highlighting the immense challenge for party leadership when dealing with even a small number of defections from their ranks on contentious issues.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire is burning out of control in eastern Crete, forcing the mass evacuation of approximately 1,500 people from homes and tourist hotels. Fanned by powerful winds, the blaze near Ierapetra has spread rapidly, destroying properties and threatening infrastructure, with a fire front extending over six kilometers. Thick smoke has blanketed the region, severely reducing visibility and creating hazardous air quality. Firefighting efforts are being hampered by rugged terrain and dry conditions, as additional emergency crews are being dispatched to the Greek island to battle the flames.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant escalation of his public criticism, President Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign "immediately." The demand was posted on social media and came after a federal housing regulator called for an investigation into Powell's testimony regarding renovations at the central bank's headquarters. Trump, who appointed Powell but has since repeatedly attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively, has questioned the Fed's independence. Powell has previously stated he would not step down if asked and that he believes the law does not permit his removal by the president.</p>

          <p>An official report has found that historical child sexual exploitation investigations in Greater Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. The inspectorate noted that some documents had only a few words visible per page, making it impossible to assess their value. This practice particularly affected two major operations investigating child grooming from the early 2000s, including one related to the death of a 15-year-old girl who had reported she had been sexually assaulted. A new, more efficient information-sharing protocol has since been established between the agencies.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The research found that for women under 55 with a uterus, using a combination of estrogen and progestin raised the risk. Conversely, for women without a uterus who could take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce breast cancer risk. This evolving science provides a more nuanced understanding than a controversial early 2000s study, highlighting the importance of personalized medical consultation based on treatment type and patient health history.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that while a slight majority of Latinos voted for Kamala Harris in 2024, Donald Trump secured a significantly higher share of their vote, 48%, compared to 2020. Political experts theorize this shift is not necessarily ideological but reflects a move toward economic populism, as many working-class Latinos feel both parties have failed them. Analysts suggest disillusionment with Democratic immigration policies and a lack of focus on economic mobility created an opening for Trump's message, indicating a dynamic and evolving electorate that defies simple categorization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's executive order that effectively suspended access to asylum for migrants crossing the southern border. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws enacted by Congress. The order, which was issued on President Trump's first day in office, had been challenged by immigrant rights groups who argued it was an unprecedented and unlawful ban. The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>

The plea deal means he faces up to four consecutive life sentences without parole and waives his right to appeal.

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who participated in the recent strike against Iranian nuclear sites are expected to keep a low profile during a proposed visit to the White House for the July Fourth holiday. President Trump invited the pilots to be celebrated as heroes, but officials say no public ceremony is planned and their identities will not be disclosed for security reasons.
