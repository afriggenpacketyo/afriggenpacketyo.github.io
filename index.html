        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stephen A. Smith suggests that Shedeur Sanders' unexpected fall in the NFL Draft is primarily due to concerns about dealing with his father, Deion Sanders, rather than his football abilities. Despite once being projected as a top pick, Sanders was not selected in the first round, with some reports citing negative feedback from coaches. Smith believes teams were wary of the potential distractions and challenges associated with Deion Sanders' vocal presence and involvement. Shedeur Sanders acknowledged his surprise at the draft outcome but remains optimistic about the future. Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>Conscious parenting coach explains that telling children "you're okay" when they are upset can invalidate their emotions and hinder their emotional development. This phrase can teach children to distrust their feelings, suppress emotional processing, and believe that love is conditional on remaining calm. Instead, parents should acknowledge and validate their children's emotions, allowing them to express and regulate their feelings in a healthy way. By providing support and understanding, parents can foster emotional safety and resilience in their children. Optimism score: 75</p>
