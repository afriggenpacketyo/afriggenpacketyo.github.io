          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the United States might extend its 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue in good faith. Bessent's remarks, made during a congressional hearing, suggested a willingness to push the deadline beyond early July for countries actively engaged in talks. President Trump later mentioned he didn't think an extension would be necessary, creating some uncertainty regarding the administration's stance. Japan, facing an additional 14 percent country-specific tariff, is among the countries actively negotiating with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials have not specified the exact cause for the evacuation, but it comes amid stalled talks regarding Iran's nuclear program. President Trump expressed decreasing confidence in Iran's commitment to halt uranium enrichment. The decision follows a tense phone call between Trump and the Israeli Prime Minister, who has advocated for a military approach rather than diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Eight female college athletes are appealing the House v. NCAA antitrust settlement, arguing it unfairly distributes $2.7 billion in back pay. They claim the settlement favors male athletes in football and basketball, violating Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. The athletes' attorney asserts that female athletes are being deprived of $1.1 billion due to an inaccurate calculation of past damages. The appeal will be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, raising questions about the equitable distribution of funds in college sports.</p>

          <p>Political Editor Chris Mason analyzes the UK's recent Spending Review, highlighting the government's gamble on long-term capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential. While day-to-day spending faces limitations and cuts, the government aims to brand this moment as a turning point for national renewal. The strategy prioritizes strategic, long-term thought over quick wins, a departure from typical political short-termism. However, this approach requires patience from an electorate already feeling squeezed, presenting a challenge for the government.</p>

          <p>The United States is reviewing the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with President Trump's "America First" agenda. This review, led by Elbridge Colby, who has previously criticized Aukus, aims to ensure the highest readiness of U.S. servicemembers and that allies fully contribute to collective defense. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, stating it is normal for a new administration to reassess agreements. The Aukus pact, signed in 2021, is intended to counter China's growing power by providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.</p>

The tournament, featuring continental champions from 2021 to 2024, offers Urawa a chance to compete against top global teams like River Plate, Inter Milan, and Monterrey. The competition's addition to the football calendar has raised concerns about congestion, but it provides Urawa with an invaluable opportunity to showcase their abilities on the world stage.

The 86-million-year-old skeletons reveal an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants like T. rex. Khankhuuluu, meaning Dragon Prince of Mongolia, weighed about 750kg and exhibits early stages of key tyrannosaur features, including skull anatomy for a strong jaw.

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts to target undocumented immigrants, particularly farm workers, through a series of raids in California. Immigration lawyers report that detainees, including families with small children, were held in inadequate conditions with limited food and water. US immigration officials carried out further “enforcement activity” in California’s agricultural heartland, with one advocacy group saying agents pursued workers through blueberry fields. The raids have sparked protests in Los Angeles and other cities across the country.</p>
