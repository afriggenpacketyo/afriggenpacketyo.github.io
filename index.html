          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans in 2025 will allow older workers to make larger catch-up contributions, potentially boosting their retirement savings. Secure 2.0 increases the catch-up limit to $11,250 for those aged 60 to 63, bringing their maximum deferral to $34,750; however, this feature is not yet available in all plans. While this offers a tax deduction and can be a valuable tool, only a small percentage of eligible employees have historically taken advantage of catch-up contributions, indicating affordability remains a barrier for many.

          <p>California State Senator Tony Strickland is advocating for policy reforms after an illegal immigrant convicted of DUI manslaughter in 2021 was slated for early release. Strickland believes changes are needed to programs like the in-prison credit system, which allowed Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano to be released after serving only three and a half years of his 10-year sentence. Following intervention from the DOJ and ICE, California will coordinate with ICE to transfer Ortega-Anguiano before his release, but Strickland insists that accountability must be restored to the system to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, marking a significant win for the anti-immigration party. Sarah Pochin, the Reform candidate, won by just six votes, signaling a potential shift in British politics. The victory could accelerate the country's move towards a more polarized, multi-party system and pose challenges for both the Labour and Conservative parties.</p>

          <p>Ryan Coogler's film 'Sinners' uses the supernatural to highlight the true horror of Jim Crow economics and its impact on Black upward mobility. The film follows twin gangsters who attempt to establish a juke joint in the 1930s South, but are thwarted by the systemic barriers of segregation. By examining the economic constraints imposed by segregation, the article argues that the film's vampire narrative serves as a metaphor for the real-world oppression faced by Black people during the Jim Crow era.</p>

          <h2>American Cities Shift Strategies for Addressing Homelessness with Tiny Homes and Stricter Laws</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities across the United States, particularly in California, are adopting new approaches to address homelessness, combining the construction of tiny home shelters with stricter enforcement of anti-camping bans. This shift follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce such bans even when alternative shelter is unavailable. While proponents argue that these strategies offer quicker and more cost-effective solutions, critics worry about creating a two-tiered housing system and the potential for increased criminalization of homelessness.</p>
