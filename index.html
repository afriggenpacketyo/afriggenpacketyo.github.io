          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough in electromagnetic coilgun technology, achieving a firing rate of 3,000 rounds per minute. This rate significantly surpasses traditional firearms and existing US commercial models. The breakthrough centers on eliminating capacitors, a limiting factor in previous electromagnetic weapons, by powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. This innovation is detailed in China’s Journal of Gun Launch & Control and could redefine future combat capabilities.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's racist tweet calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire has sparked a free speech row after she was sentenced to 31 months in jail for inciting racial hatred. Her legal team argued the sentence was excessive, but the Court of Appeal disagreed. The Free Speech Union funded her appeal, raising concerns about increasing police interest in online activity and the limits of free speech online. While some defend her right to express her views, others argue her tweet incited violence and should be held accountable.</p>

The city is working to address the lifeguard shortage through incentives like increased wages and signing bonuses. The Parks Department has also improved lifeguard stations and expanded training locations. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, though some remain vigilant due to the ongoing shortage. </p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist, whose book “Against Our Will: Men, Women and sexual assault” helped define the modern view of sexual assault, debunking it as an act of passion and reframing it as a crime of power and violence, died on Saturday at 90. Her book offered the first comprehensive history of sexual assault across the centuries and examined its use as a wartime military tactic. Brownmiller was a vociferous opponent of the multi-billion-dollar pornography industry, believing its dehumanization of women was a major contributor to sexual violence.</p>
