          <p>Tesla is appealing a verdict that found the company partially liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, which resulted in one death and severe injuries. The company has asked a Florida court to either dismiss the $242.5 million judgment or grant a new trial, arguing the vehicle had no design defects and the driver was entirely at fault. The incident occurred when the driver, believing Autopilot would brake for obstacles, was distracted and his Model S accelerated through an intersection. Plaintiffs' counsel maintains the jury correctly assigned shared responsibility due to Tesla's misrepresentations of Autopilot's capabilities.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders commented on a surprising and consistent aspect of home games at Folsom Field: the strong smell of marijuana. In an interview, Sanders noted that the scent becomes particularly noticeable during a TV timeout in the second quarter of every game, which he humorously dubbed the "light-up quarter." The Pro Football Hall of Famer, who is entering his third season as coach, stated he has never been high and finds the recurring phenomenon new to him. Colorado is set to open its season at home against Georgia Tech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is deliberating on whether to block President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. Cook filed a lawsuit challenging the termination as unlawful, arguing the president can only remove a governor "for cause" related to their official duties. The administration cites allegations that Cook made false statements on mortgage applications years before her appointment, while her lawyers contend this does not meet the legal standard and violates her due process rights. The case raises unprecedented questions about the president's authority over the historically independent central bank.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees multigenerational, high-value "trophy" ranches being listed for sale as heirs find it difficult to manage the properties or prefer to cash out their inheritance. Brokers report a significant increase in inventory of these legacy properties, some on the market for the first time in over a century, driven by family disagreements and a lack of interest from younger generations. Demand remains strong from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, seeking privacy and a connection to nature. However, the sales often represent a bittersweet end to a family's long history on the land.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso finished second, splitting Norris and his teammate Oscar Piastri, but dismissed the idea of competing with McLaren for a front-row start in qualifying. Despite his strong showing, Alonso believes Aston Martin's realistic competitors are Mercedes, Ferrari, and Red Bull. The sessions were eventful, with several drivers, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, having off-track moments, and Lance Stroll crashing out early in the second practice.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has maintained a block on the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel affirmed a lower court's ruling, stating that the Department of Homeland Security likely lacks the authority to terminate a prior TPS extension under the governing statute. The court emphasized that Congress designed the TPS system to be dependable and insulated from political shifts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The era of inexpensive international online shopping for Americans is ending as the Trump administration has eliminated the "de minimis" exemption for all countries. This loophole previously allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties or tariffs, fueling the growth of e-commerce platforms like Shein, Temu, Etsy, and Amazon Marketplace sellers. Consumers will now likely face higher prices due to passed-on import taxes, longer shipping times from customs backlogs, or find that some international sellers no longer ship to the U.S. The policy change aims to level the playing field for domestic retailers but marks a significant shift for consumers accustomed to cheap, direct-from-overseas goods.</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Atlantic critiques the Trump administration's use of the phrase "No one is above the law" as a justification for investigating political opponents. The article argues this is a false equivalence, contrasting the current situation with the Biden administration, which appointed a special counsel for the Trump investigation and prosecuted Democrats, including the president's own son. The author contends that the concept of using the justice system against political rivals was introduced into modern American politics by Trump himself during his 2016 campaign. The piece concludes that Trump's actions are part of a consistent pattern of treating the law as a tool to be wielded against enemies.</p>

However, analysts caution that it is too early to declare the meeting a definitive success. Several major issues, including the formal details of a new trade agreement and the cost-sharing arrangement for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, remain unresolved and could test the new relationship.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Cut Nearly $5 Billion in Foreign Aid Funding</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has informed Congress of its intent to slash $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding for USAID and the State Department. The White House is utilizing a rarely used process known as a "pocket rescission," which involves submitting the request so late in the fiscal year that the funds expire before Congress is required to vote on the cuts. The move has drawn bipartisan criticism, with Republican Senator Susan Collins calling it an illegal attempt to rescind funds without congressional approval. The action sidesteps the normal appropriations process, escalating tensions over Congress's power of the purse.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial condemns President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook as an authoritarian move, but argues that the controversy should prompt a deeper reflection on central bank independence. The article posits that the Fed's independence is not synonymous with democracy, as it insulates the institution from electoral accountability while giving business elites formal influence. The piece suggests that instead of simply defending the status quo, the focus should be on envisioning a more democratic form of central banking. This could include treating the Fed as a public utility and ensuring broader representation on its boards.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece by Jonathan Freedland in The Guardian argues that the United States is steadily moving towards authoritarianism under President Trump. The author cites a pattern of actions, including the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, using federal agencies to investigate political rivals, and attempting to remove a Federal Reserve governor. The article also points to efforts to gerrymander congressional districts and undermine postal voting as attempts to make it impossible for the opposition to win elections. The author suggests these moves are brazen and often discounted but collectively paint a picture of a leader consolidating power and eroding democratic institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are seeking debt relief. Qualifying for these programs depends on the specific option and an individual's financial situation. For example, traditional debt consolidation loans typically require a good credit score and steady income, while debt forgiveness programs are designed for those facing severe financial hardship with significant unsecured debt. Other options include debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies and forbearance programs from credit card issuers, each with its own set of requirements based on income, debt levels, and hardship status.

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, its highest level since February. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, suggests that President Trump's tariffs are contributing to rising prices within the U.S. economy. Despite inflation running well above the Fed's 2% target, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting. The report also showed that consumer spending and personal income both increased, indicating continued economic strength despite higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has canceled $679 million in federal funding for twelve infrastructure projects designed to support the offshore wind industry. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy described the projects as "wasteful" and stated the funds would be redirected to other maritime industry upgrades. The largest affected project is the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind marine terminal in California, which lost about $427 million in support. This move is the latest in the Trump administration's escalating campaign against renewable energy, following a recent order to halt work on a nearly completed wind project off the New England coast.</p>

          <p>For savers seeking predictable returns with less volatility than the stock market, a certificate of deposit (CD) can be an attractive option. With a $30,000 deposit, current interest rates could yield significant earnings, ranging from over $300 for a 3-month term to more than $6,700 for a 5-year term. The main benefit of a CD is its fixed interest rate, which locks in a high return for the duration of the term, protecting savers from anticipated future rate cuts. However, this comes with a trade-off, as funds are inaccessible without penalty until the CD matures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece contrasts California Governor Gavin Newsom's deployment of California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers with President Trump's use of National Guard troops in U.S. cities. While both actions respond to public anxiety about crime, the article argues they represent fundamentally different approaches to public safety. Newsom's strategy involves using small, specialized CHP teams to supplement local police in targeting specific crime hotspots, a tactic that has reportedly shown success. This is framed as a nuanced law enforcement approach, distinct from what the author describes as Trump's more authoritarian use of military force for repression.</p>
