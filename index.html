          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi confirmed that recent military strikes caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. While the full extent is still being assessed, Grossi emphasized that Iran's technical knowledge remains, making a purely military solution insufficient for long-term security. He stressed the urgent need for diplomatic talks and the re-establishment of IAEA inspections to verify Iran's activities and account for its stockpile of highly enriched uranium. The interview highlights the critical uncertainties and the necessity of a verifiable, lasting diplomatic agreement to resolve the crisis.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has reported credible threats that Hamas is offering monetary rewards for killing or injuring its American and Palestinian aid workers. This follows a previous deadly attack on GHF staff and alleged attempts by Hamas to disrupt the organization's aid distribution system. In a statement, the GHF condemned the threats, asserting that its personnel are heroes trying to feed civilians amid the conflict. The group called on the international community to address Hamas's actions, which it says demonstrate a preference for "chaos and starvation to peace and aid."</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israeli strikes across Gaza have killed at least 81 Palestinians and injured over 400 within a 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near a stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people in tents, resulting in at least 11 fatalities, including children. Additional deadly strikes were reported in the al-Mawasi area and the Tuffah neighborhood, with children among the deceased. Amid the ongoing violence, US President Donald Trump expressed hope for a ceasefire, while mediators work to revive stalled negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road connecting the Central Coast to the San Joaquin Valley. However, upon investigation, the responding officer discovered that the animal was not an exotic feline but a deceased hawk. It remains unclear what led to the caller's zoological misidentification. The incident serves as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without special permits.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are urgently working to pass a 940-page budget bill, a cornerstone of President Donald Trump's agenda, before a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The legislation aims to make permanent some $3.8 trillion in tax cuts from 2017 while introducing new ones, funded partly by cuts to welfare programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The bill faces internal division among Republicans over its details, including the cap on state and local tax deductions. Democrats have strongly criticized the proposed healthcare cuts, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could leave nearly 8 million people uninsured.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, analysis shows contrasting descriptions of the damage from President Trump, his aides, and intelligence reports. Initially, officials claimed the facilities were "obliterated," but this narrative evolved after a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggested a more limited setback of only a few months for Iran's program. Officials then shifted their focus, emphasizing that "significant, substantial damage" was done and highlighting the attack's success in achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. The varying accounts have sparked ongoing questions about the true extent of the damage and the ultimate goals of the military operation.</p>

At events like the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit, figures including Donald Trump and RNC Chair Michael Whatley have labeled Mamdani a "communist" to portray the entire Democratic party as radical and out of touch. While some progressives have embraced Mamdani, moderate Democrats have been more hesitant. The strategy aims to energize conservative voters and defend GOP congressional majorities by linking all Democrats to Mamdani's progressive policies on taxes and public services.</p>

Norris described his qualifying lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, signaling a return to form after a season marked by qualifying errors. The performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a front suspension revision designed to improve his feel for the car. While championship leader and teammate Oscar Piastri will start third, Norris's dominant qualifying run provides a satisfying boost and a strong opportunity for the race.</p>

Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this defect.

The massive turnout was seen as a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's right-wing government, which has increasingly cracked down on LGBTQ+ rights. Participants and international observers framed the event not just as a fight for equal rights but as a defense of democratic processes in Hungary.</p>

The protest, organized by the United Force of the Land, reflects growing public anger and political pressure on the Prime Minister.

          <p>UK authorities have announced one of the country's largest-ever drug seizures after discovering 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The shipment, with an estimated street value of Â£96 million (â‚¬112 million), was found hidden beneath dozens of shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. Border Force officials stated that container ships are a primary method for criminal organizations to smuggle cocaine into the UK. The seizure highlights the ongoing efforts by law enforcement to disrupt international drug trafficking networks amid a rise in cocaine-related deaths in the country.</p>
