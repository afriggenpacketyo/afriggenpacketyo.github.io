          <p>An independent Water Commission review has found that the water sector in England and Wales is failing, citing concerns about pollution, financial mismanagement, and infrastructure failures which have shaken public trust. The review, initiated by the government in response to growing public concern over sewage spills and rising bills, suggests stronger regulation is needed to better protect billpayers and the environment. While the government has ruled out nationalizing the sector due to cost concerns, the review highlights the urgent need for improvements and greater accountability within the existing framework. The commission's interim findings emphasize the importance of restoring public confidence in the water sector through effective regulation and responsible management. Optimism score is based on the potential for positive change through stronger oversight.</p>

          <p>The UN secretary-general has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution center in Gaza, amid conflicting reports regarding Israeli forces opening fire. Witnesses reported being shot at while waiting for food from the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) center in Rafah, resulting in numerous casualties. While the Israeli military denied firing at civilians, the UN human rights chief criticized the dehumanizing way humanitarian aid is being delivered, emphasizing the utter disregard for civilians desperate for food and medicine. The GHF refuted reports of any incidents at or near its facility, with the US ambassador accusing news outlets of spreading misinformation, but the UN continues to press for accountability and a thorough examination of the events. The overall situation reflects a dire humanitarian crisis and the urgent need for impartial investigation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will increase its defense spending and modernize its military capabilities in response to growing threats from Russia and to reassure NATO allies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced plans to build new nuclear-powered attack submarines and prepare the army for potential conflict in Europe. The strategic defense review, led by former NATO Secretary General George Robertson, aims to address threats in various domains, including land, air, sea, and cyberspace. The measures include increased weapons production, investment in cyber capabilities, and the development of advanced drone technology, with the goal of making Britain a battle-ready nation. This initiative sends a message to both Moscow and Washington about Britain's commitment to defense and security.</p>

Equipped with an AI-enabled targeting system, the drones can autonomously lock onto and strike enemy ships after target assignment.

While the previous government had some successes in restoring judicial independence and unlocking EU funds, many promises remained unfulfilled, leading to voter frustration.

          <p>Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank will not aggressively pursue policy rate hikes unless economic and price conditions show clear improvement. He cited the "extremely high" uncertainty stemming from substantial U.S. tariffs as a key factor influencing this cautious stance. Ueda emphasized that the BOJ will not raise rates simply to create room for future easing, but will continue to monitor economic and price developments closely. The BOJ's stance reflects concerns that trade frictions triggered by U.S. tariffs could negatively impact the global economy and domestic corporate profits. (not investment advice)</p>
