          <p>The film "Rust" is finally being released in theaters after a tragic on-set incident in 2021 where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed by a prop gun fired by Alec Baldwin. The article details the legal battles and media frenzy that followed the incident, as well as the documentary "Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna," which focuses on Hutchins' life and career. Baldwin was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter, but the charges were dropped, while the film's armorer was convicted and sentenced. The movie's release has been controversial, with some criticizing it as insensitive, while others view it as a tribute to Hutchins. Matt Hutchins, Halyna's widower, reached a settlement with the film's producers and became an executive producer on the film.</p>

Jennings emphasizes his preference for creative work that comes from a human mind, rather than AI. He acknowledges the fear of AI replacing creatives in Hollywood, which was a key issue during the writers' and actors' strikes.

In addition to the by-election win, Reform also gained its first mayoralty in Greater Lincolnshire. Labour requested a recount due to the close initial tally. Nigel Farage, present at the count, stated that the result positions Reform as the main opposition to the Labour government.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered a $5.3 billion deal with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss, signaling Roche's intent to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the obesity drug market. Amylin analogs mimic a hormone that increases satiety, differing from GLP-1 drugs that suppress appetite. Early clinical data suggests amylin analogs may offer comparable weight reduction with better tolerability and lean muscle preservation. The partnership will explore petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset, CT-388, with Zealand receiving upfront payments and potential milestone payments. The deal is viewed as a win-win, leveraging Zealand's expertise and Roche's commercial capabilities.</p>

The most significant tremor, measuring 1.74 on the Richter scale, was triggered by Alexis Mac Allister's goal, which put Liverpool ahead. The data was recorded by University of Liverpool earth scientists using equipment used to detect earthquakes. The study revealed that the 60,415-strong crowd generated real seismic activity, particularly in response to goals scored during the game.

          <p>The UK's recent RAF attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen, approved by the Labour government, has sparked controversy and criticism. The operation aligns the UK with a major US military campaign initiated by the Trump administration. The article argues that Keir Starmer's government is increasingly supporting Trump's policies, despite growing concerns over civilian casualties and the broader implications of the conflict. The author highlights the close military ties between the UK and Israel, suggesting that this support for Trump's policies could alienate long-term Labour supporters. The piece argues that the Starmer government should use its influence to rein in Netanyahu instead of increasing military support for Trump.</p>

          <h2>India to Include Caste Details in Upcoming Census</h2>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a decision expected to have significant socio-economic and political consequences. This move is likely to lead to demands for increasing quotas for government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for various caste categories. The decision demonstrates New Delhi's commitment to the values and interests of society. While past governments resisted updating caste data, supporters argue that detailed demographic information is essential for implementing social justice programs. The opposition and Modi's partners have been pressing the government to count caste in a new census.</p>

          <p>China has indicated it is evaluating U.S. overtures to initiate trade negotiations, potentially opening the door for discussions to resolve the ongoing trade war. A spokesperson for the commerce ministry stated that senior U.S. officials have recently reached out multiple times, expressing a desire to start negotiations. However, Chinese authorities reiterated that the U.S. must remove all unilateral tariffs to demonstrate sincerity. Failure to do so would compromise mutual trust. The latest comments follow conflicting statements from both sides regarding the status of talks. U.S. officials have suggested that easing tensions is possible, while China insists on tariff removal as a precondition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated a loophole allowing Americans to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs. This change impacts online shoppers and U.S. manufacturers. The de minimis rule, which exempted products up to $800, has been ended for shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong. The move aims to help U.S. businesses compete with low-cost Chinese products. Concerns about fentanyl smuggling and job losses in warehousing and logistics also contributed to the decision. However, critics argue that it will raise prices for consumers and hurt small businesses. The changes went into effect on Friday, causing potential confusion for consumers and retailers.</p>

The program's administrator, Dr. John Howard, was allegedly reinstated after public backlash, but questions lingered about his full authority. The restoration of certification means the program can once again review and approve claims from responders and survivors who have developed new conditions. Clinics can now resume treatment for patients whose care had been postponed. Media coverage and bipartisan pressure are credited for the reversal.</p>

          <p>Researchers have created the first laboratory analog of the 'black hole bomb,' a theoretical concept proposed by Roger Penrose in 1971. The experiment consists of a rotating aluminum cylinder placed inside layers of coils that generate magnetic fields, simulating the ergosphere of a black hole. The experiment demonstrated a clear amplification effect, based on the theories described decades ago. Because black holes cannot be probed directly, analogs such as this are an excellent way to understand their properties. The experiment could represent a significant step towards better understanding the physics of the most gravitationally extreme objects in the Universe.</p>

This signaling comes as tariffs appear to have impacted Chinese producers, with manufacturing activity slowing down.

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, increasing prices for US customers of firms like Shein and Temu. The Chinese online retail giants used the "de minimis" exemption to sell and ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. Supporters of the loophole argue it streamlined the customs process, but Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods. Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee.</p>
