        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has significantly reduced its full-year guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros. The company attributes the downturn to the disruptive effects of U.S. tariffs, restructuring costs, and lower profit margins on its growing electric vehicle sales. In response to these challenges, Volkswagen now projects its 2025 operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, down from a previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%. The financial results reflect broader industry struggles, including intense competition and ongoing trade policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of German sportswear company Puma fell by 18% after it cut its full-year sales and profit projections, citing the negative impact of U.S. trade tariffs. The company now anticipates a low-double-digit percentage decline in sales for 2025, a stark reversal from its previous forecast of growth. Puma also expects an operating profit loss, attributing the revision to muted brand momentum, elevated inventory levels, and an anticipated 80-million-euro impact from U.S. tariffs. The news underscores the significant pressure on the competitive sportswear market from macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom increased by 0.9% in June, a rise attributed to a month of unusually hot weather, according to the Office for National Statistics. The warm temperatures boosted supermarket sales, particularly of drinks, and increased fuel sales as more people traveled. However, this rebound follows a sharper-than-expected 2.8% decline in May, and economists noted the June increase was smaller than anticipated. The overall trend suggests that the momentum in retail spending has slowed, reflecting weaker consumer confidence and indicating potentially lackluster economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors has commenced in England, prompting Health Secretary Wes Streeting to assure the public that efforts are being made to minimize service disruptions. Unlike previous walkouts that focused solely on emergency care, NHS England has instructed hospitals to continue non-urgent services where possible, with senior doctors covering for their striking colleagues. The British Medical Association (BMA) is demanding pay restoration to offset inflation since 2008, warning that the current approach risks stretching staff too thin.

          <p>Georges Abdallah, a 74-year-old Lebanese militant who became a symbol for the far-left Palestinian cause, has been released from a French prison after 41 years.

Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, a situation his supporters attribute to pressure from the United States and Israel. An appeals court ruled his continued detention "disproportionate," ordering his release and immediate expulsion to Lebanon, making him one of the longest-serving prisoners for acts related to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of a healthy economic relationship between China and the European Union, characterized by both cooperation and competition. Speaking at a business symposium with EU leaders, Li stated that deepening collaboration in areas like services trade, green technology, and innovation is the "only right choice" for both sides. He argued that amid rising global protectionism, a strong China-EU partnership could serve as a stabilizing anchor for global trade and supply chains. The symposium was attended by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and nearly 60 representatives from European businesses and chambers of commerce.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley stated he feels more "refreshed and recharged" than he has in a long time, despite facing immense pressure to win in his fourth year. Coming off a disappointing 7-6 season, Riley believes the program is now built and focused on making small refinements rather than major fixes. He credits his new general manager for easing his personnel duties and points to the nation's top-ranked 2026 recruiting class as evidence of the program's strong momentum. Despite a decline in wins over his first three seasons, Riley expressed confidence in the team's progress and its potential to succeed in close games.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating athlete compensation in college sports, empowering federal agencies to enforce new rules on scholarships and licensing deals. The order seeks to protect non-revenue and women's sports by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels and aims to rein in lucrative name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals that are not based on fair market value. This move follows the recent House settlement that allows universities to pay players directly, which raised fears that resources would be diverted from less profitable sports. The order represents a significant federal intervention into the rapidly changing landscape of collegiate athletics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media in a contentious 2-1 vote. The deal places iconic assets like the CBS network and Paramount Pictures under Skydance's control. The approval followed Skydance's pledge to install an ombudsman to handle complaints of editorial bias at CBS News. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who highlighted its timing, coming just days after Paramount settled a $16 million lawsuit with President Trump and cancelled Stephen Colbert's show, which had been critical of the administration. The dissenting commissioner called the outcome a "cowardly capitulation."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The suit claims these laws intentionally obstruct federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals into federal custody. The legal action follows a recent shooting of an off-duty border patrol officer, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. City officials defended the policies, stating they are crucial for ensuring all residents, regardless of status, feel safe reporting crimes, but noted they have urged the City Council to re-examine parts of the laws.</p>

Powell disputed this figure, explaining that the number included a separate building renovation that was completed five years ago. Despite the friction and Trump's continued calls for lower interest rates, the president stated that firing Powell is not necessary and that he believes the Fed chair will "do the right thing."</p>
