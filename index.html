          <p>UK house prices rose in April for the first time this year, driven by easing mortgage costs and steady buyer demand, according to figures from lender Halifax. The average UK property is now valued at £297,781, up from £296,899 in the previous month, with an annual growth rate of 3.2%. Despite monthly fluctuations, prices have remained broadly flat over the past half-year, and mortgage rates have continued to fall.

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, after teasing a major announcement with a "big and highly respected, country." The specifics of any agreement were not immediately clear and there was no comment from the White House or the British embassy in Washington on whether an actual deal had been reached or if the framework would need further negotiation. The US has been in talks with the UK for weeks as both sides sought to reach a quick deal, discussing lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as lowering British taxes on US technology companies.</p>
