          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing is almost finished to make way for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom project initiated by President Donald Trump. The administration confirmed the project's cost has risen to $300 million, which it states is being financed entirely by private and corporate donors. A list of contributors includes major technology companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. The White House has dismissed public criticism over the historic structure's removal as "manufactured outrage."</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested over 30 individuals, including NBA coach Chauncey Billups and player Terry Rozier, in a major investigation into illegal gambling operations. The probe uncovered two schemes: one involving insider sports betting and another concerning technologically rigged high-stakes poker games. The criminal enterprise has been linked to several of New York's major organized crime families, who allegedly profited from and supported the illicit activities. This widespread bust raises serious questions about the integrity of professional sports and its potential ties to organized crime.</p>

          <p>Chinese-owned battery company Gotion has abandoned its plan to construct a $2.4 billion factory in Michigan for electric vehicle battery materials. The project, which was expected to create over 2,300 jobs, faced criticism from some lawmakers due to the company's ties to China. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation stated that a $125 million state grant was never disbursed and it will seek repayment of a separate $23.6 million award used for the property purchase. The decision marks a significant setback for the state's efforts to expand its EV manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, the USDA has warned that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is projected to run out by November 1. This potential lapse in aid could affect approximately 42 million Americans who rely on the benefits for food security. The funding crisis has become a key point of contention between Republicans and Democrats, with each party blaming the other for the impasse over the federal budget.

The resignations were a protest against Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, whom they accuse of betrayal.

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing is proceeding ahead of schedule, prompting deep concern from historic preservation groups. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has called for a halt to the project, arguing it will overwhelm the original White House design and has not undergone legally required public review. However, the White House has dismissed these concerns and has not yet submitted formal construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, creating a contentious debate over presidential authority and historical conservation.</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will step in to pay the salaries of approximately 11,000 local employees at U.S. military bases in Germany. This measure is intended to prevent workers from missing their October paychecks due to the ongoing U.S. federal government shutdown. A German Finance Ministry spokesperson described the move as a "sign of solidarity" with the U.S. armed forces stationed in the country. Berlin anticipates being reimbursed by the United States once the funding impasse in Washington is resolved.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, known for its popular Labubu dolls, fell 9% despite the company reporting that its third-quarter U.S. sales had swelled by over 1,200%. The stock decline reflects growing investor concern that the collectible toy craze may be fading, as resale prices for some popular figures have begun to drop. Analysts are divided, with some seeing the price drop as a sign of waning demand, while others believe it reflects the company's successful efforts to increase supply and counter scalpers.

          <p>A new study has found a significant link between contaminated meat and urinary tract infections (UTIs), suggesting that food safety is a contributing factor to the common health issue. Researchers discovered that 18% of UTIs in a group of Southern California patients were caused by E. coli strains genetically matched to those found in grocery store meat, particularly turkey and chicken. The study also revealed that individuals in low-income areas had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs. The findings highlight the need for improved food safety practices to prevent these infections.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent cancellation of a planned summit with Vladimir Putin and the imposition of new sanctions on Russian oil companies signal a shift in U.S. strategy. After previous diplomatic engagements yielded little progress, the administration appears to be moving from a conciliatory approach to one of increased pressure. Russia has condemned the sanctions as an "unfriendly act," with some officials calling them an act of war. This change in tactics reflects Washington's growing frustration with Moscow's refusal to compromise on its objectives in the Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>Three Metropolitan Police officers have been dismissed following an undercover BBC Panorama investigation that exposed misconduct at Charing Cross police station. The officers were secretly recorded making misogynistic and racist comments, and one was filmed being dismissive of a pregnant woman's allegation of sexual assault. During expedited misconduct hearings, the panel chair described their behavior as a "disgrace" and upheld the allegations, leading to their immediate dismissal. These are the first of ten officers facing hearings as a result of the investigative report.</p>

These victims were often lured by the opportunity to play with professional athletes, who were allegedly complicit in the scam.

Existing employees will not be required to obtain a digital ID to keep their current jobs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that the ID will not be compulsory for accessing essential services like healthcare and is intended to streamline processes like renting or buying a house. Despite these assurances, the plan faces significant public opposition, with a petition to scrap it nearing three million signatures.</p>
