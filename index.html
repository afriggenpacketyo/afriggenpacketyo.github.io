          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors amidst increased government repression and calls for a boycott from the opposition. The vote marks the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which incumbent President Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won despite fraud allegations. The main opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado, urges voters to boycott, deeming the elections a "parody" to legitimize Maduro's rule, while a smaller faction advocates participation to prevent Maduro from tightening control. The government has detained dozens of people, including opposition leaders, accusing them of plotting to disrupt the election, highlighting the ongoing political tensions.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig reflects on her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us" and the broader appeal of zombie narratives. She finds that immersing herself in a fictional apocalypse provides a distraction from real-world anxieties. Feintzeig recalls how watching horror movies helped her cope with personal grief, offering a temporary escape from her own circumstances. She acknowledges that while some find solace in lighter entertainment, she is drawn to the intensity of the genre, even if it tortures her, as it provides a unique form of perspective.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Defund movement, sparked by the murder of George Floyd, has been more successful than commonly perceived. The authors contend that the movement illuminated a new vision of community safety prioritizing care, restoration, and prevention over policing. They highlight that the movement shifted public opinion, led to increased investments in community safety, and inspired radical policy proposals. Despite setbacks like the failure of the Minneapolis ballot amendment, the authors emphasize that the movement achieved significant wins, including cuts to police budgets and increased investments in community services.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice, seen as insensitive amid rising rice prices. The survey also showed that 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than recently pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has slightly increased, though disapproval remains high.</p>

          <p>The Kyiv region and Mykolaiv have sustained damage following a deadly Russian drone and missile attack. The large-scale attack occurred on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month, which have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. The attacks underscore the ongoing conflict and the fragile nature of any agreements between the two nations, as well as the human cost of the conflict.</p>

          <p>A virologist is urging calm after West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, noting that mosquito-borne diseases are "likely" to increase in range due to climate change. Fragments of the virus were found in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, but there have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date. The public does not need to be "too concerned," but should be aware that these viruses are likely to increase in range. The best way to avoid the virus is to "avoid being bitten" by covering up and using insecticide.</p>

          <p>Religious services, concerts, and vigils are planned to mark the fifth anniversary of George Floydâ€™s murder by a Minneapolis police officer. Events are scheduled in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, and Houston, where he grew up. The remembrances come at a time when activists face pushback from the Trump administration on police reform and civil rights issues. Despite promises to remake the police department in Minneapolis, some activists feel progress has been slow, while the Trump administration has moved to cancel settlements aimed at overhauling police departments and has declared an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p>
