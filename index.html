            <p>NASA astronaut Don Pettit, along with cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner, completed their 220-day mission on the International Space Station, returning to Earth with a landing in Kazakhstan. Pettit, who turned 70 on the day of landing, experienced some disorientation upon returning to gravity, a common issue for him after long space stays. During their time on the ISS, the crew orbited Earth over 3,500 times, covering 93.3 million miles.

            <p>A 27-year-old man in Utah was arrested after allegedly attempting to run a Tesla off the road at high speeds in a road rage incident. The suspect, Oscar Fayani, reportedly rammed the Tesla while driving over 100 mph and continued to pursue the vehicle even after it exited the freeway. Upon arrest, Fayani was found to be driving with a revoked license and had outstanding warrants, and a search of his vehicle revealed drug paraphernalia and cocaine. This incident is part of a broader trend of hostility and vandalism targeting Tesla owners and dealerships, often fueled by political motivations or resentment towards the company's CEO, Elon Musk.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully tested a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb that creates devastating chemical chain reactions without nuclear materials. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, uses a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material and when activated by conventional explosives, it generates a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds. This development could have implications for both civilian and military applications, offering a powerful explosive alternative without the dangers of nuclear fallout.</p>

            <p>Former Los Angeles Councilmember Kevin de León is facing an $18,750 ethics fine for voting on city council decisions in which he had a financial interest and for failing to disclose income. The ethics report says that in 2020-21 De León voted on three city council issues that benefited the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and one that helped USC — all decisions that were made less than a year after he received more than $500 income from each. According to state law, elected officials must disclose each source of gross income of $500 or more received in the 12 months before taking office. The ethics commission said that De León cooperated with staff and that he has no prior enforcement history. However, the ethics commission noted the violations in this case are serious and that “the violations appear to indicate a pattern of conduct.”</p>

The announcement came the day after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump's administration was ready to "move on" from peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made in the coming days.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given "a reasonable time" to contest their pending removals. The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by recent wildfires are suing major California insurance carriers, including State Farm, alleging collusion and violations of antitrust and unfair competition laws. The lawsuits claim that insurers conspired to push homeowners into the California FAIR Plan, which provides limited coverage at higher premiums. The plaintiffs seek damages and a jury trial. The suits follow concerns about insurers canceling policies in fire-risk zones and the FAIR Plan becoming overwhelmed, leading to calls for a government investigation.</p>

            <h2>Police Algorithm Failed to Prevent Woman's Murder in Spain</h2>

            <p>A woman in Spain, identified as Lina, was murdered by her ex-partner after a police algorithm, VioGén, assessed her risk level as "medium." Despite reporting threats and requesting a restraining order, which was denied, Lina did not receive the level of protection that a "high" risk assessment would have triggered. The article raises questions about the effectiveness and potential biases of algorithms used to assess domestic violence risk. Critics suggest that police may be relying too heavily on these systems, and there is a need for independent audits to ensure they are accurately protecting women.</p>

            <p>Civilians fleeing conflicts in both Sudan and South Sudan are trapped in the border town of Renk. The town has become a transit hub, overwhelmed with refugees from both countries. Many, like Sarah Williams, have been displaced multiple times by violence. The UN warns that the 2018 peace agreement between Kiir and Machar is at risk of collapsing. Overcrowding, disease, and aid cuts are exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Renk, leaving thousands stranded between two conflicts.</p>
