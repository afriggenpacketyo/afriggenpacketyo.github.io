          <p>President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria addressed the nation on his second anniversary, defending his administration's economic reforms, including currency devaluation and subsidy cuts, asserting they are "working" despite rising consumer prices. Tinubu claimed his government has stabilized the economy and positioned Nigeria for growth, even amidst global shocks. The World Bank acknowledged Nigeria's recent economic growth, the highest in a decade, although it cautioned about persistent high inflation. Critics, like politician Omoyele Sowore, denounced Tinubu's policies, accusing him of favoring corrupt officials while citizens struggle with increased living costs; Sowore also criticized the government's security management regarding Boko Haram.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global markets experienced a surge after a panel of U.S. judges blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs, which had been a threat to consumers, supply chains, and corporate earnings. The ruling, though subject to appeal, was seen as a potential slowdown in the trade war, boosting investor confidence. Nvidia's strong earnings report, driven by the tech industry's embrace of artificial intelligence, further fueled the market rally, with its stock significantly influencing major indexes. While the court's decision reduces the likelihood of extreme and rapidly changing tariffs in the long run, it also introduces short-term uncertainty as businesses navigate potential appeals and challenges, suggesting continued market volatility.

The ruling stated that Trump exceeded his authority on tariffs aimed at combating barriers against American goods abroad and stemming the flow of fentanyl across the U.S. border.

The article argues that the ban, part of an "America First" agenda, could harm universities beyond Harvard and undermine American research and innovation.

While stocks rose internationally in hopes of a restrained assault on world markets, economists noted Trump could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs. The court's decision offers a fragile chance at reprieve for economies like Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union, and India, but guarantees continued chaos. The ruling blocks across-the-board tariffs but does not roll back sector-specific tariffs, leaving negotiations on economically important sectors ongoing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the Trump administration are set to present arguments in court regarding the administration's attempt to prevent the university from enrolling international students. Harvard's legal strategy involves using President Trump's public statements as evidence of a political crusade against the school, arguing that the administration has unjustly singled out the university. The ban, which affects 7,000 students, is based on allegations of civil rights violations and antisemitism, which Harvard President Alan Garber says he is addressing. The case has implications beyond Harvard, potentially deterring international students from studying in the United States.</p>

          <h2>Trump Tariff Ruling Has Limited Impact on US-UK Trade Deal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent court ruling blocking some of President Trump's tariffs has limited direct impact on the UK's trade deal with the US, as it doesn't affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are key UK exports. While the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, the agreement is not yet in effect. The ruling does prevent Trump from imposing blanket tariffs on other UK goods, such as salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision. The uncertainty surrounding international trade adds complexity for businesses in planning and investment.</p>

This decision undermines the administration's trade negotiation strategy and emboldens legal challenges, potentially impacting deals with countries like Japan and the European Union.
