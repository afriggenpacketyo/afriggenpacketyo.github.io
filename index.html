          <p>Paramjit Singh, a 48-year-old US green card holder suffering from a brain tumor and heart condition, has been detained by US immigration authorities for over two months, facing potential deportation. His family and lawyer accuse Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of using decades-old, disputed cases to justify his detention and deny him adequate medical care. Singh, who has lived in the US since 1994, was detained upon returning from India, and his family alleges authorities may have mistaken him for someone else regarding a forgery charge. His health concerns are escalating as a second brain tumor surgery is delayed.</p>

The team also found that injecting sperm microRNAs from exercised mice into normal fertilized eggs reproduced these beneficial traits in the offspring.

          <p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, once an al Qaeda affiliate leader designated as a terrorist, is now tasked with stabilizing and rebuilding a traumatized Syria after overthrowing the Assad regime.

          <p>Mutassim Abdulsatir, a survivor of Syria's Sednaya prison, recounted horrifying experiences of violence, torture, and daily deaths under the Assad regime. Accused of 'state terrorism,' Abdulsatir described being beaten with pipes, locked in a tiny cell for months, and witnessing fellow prisoners die from abuse and starvation. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have corroborated these accounts, documenting mass executions and systematic deprivation within the prison. The article details the emotional impact on Abdulsatir revisiting the prison, and his call for a fair trial for those responsible, suggesting the site be transformed into a memorial.</p>

          <p>Retired four-star General Tim Haugh, former head of the National Security Agency, warns that China has extensively hacked into US critical infrastructure, targeting basic services like water, electricity, and transportation. Haugh stated that China's actions, which defy international norms, are not for economic gain but to establish an advantage in a crisis or conflict, potentially to distract the US during an Indo-Pacific challenge. The article highlights intrusions discovered in utilities, including a small Massachusetts town's water provider, indicating every target is on China's list. Haugh emphasizes the urgent need to secure these vulnerable networks.</p>

          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often proves challenging amidst busy lives, leading to a common phenomenon known as 'ghosting,' where connections fade despite good intentions. This article explores how life changes, such as career focus or starting a family, make friendships susceptible to 'collateral damage,' with research indicating people lose half their friends every seven years. Experts suggest embracing honesty, vulnerability, and creativity in maintaining bonds, even through mundane activities. The article emphasizes that social connection is vital for well-being, combating 'relational loneliness,' and advises initiating contact and trusting that friendships are more resilient than perceived.</p>

          <h2>Thermal Cameras Reveal Stress Levels by Measuring Nose Temperature Drop</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels and monitor recovery. The article describes an experimental stress test where volunteers, including a BBC correspondent, experienced a 2-6 degree temperature dip in their noses when confronted with unexpected public speaking and mental arithmetic tasks. This physiological response, where blood flow shifts away from the nose to prepare for danger, offers a non-invasive method to assess stress in individuals, including babies or those unable to communicate. Researchers believe this could be a 'game changer' for stress management.</p>

          <p>A landmark lawsuit against five major carmakers—Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault, and Nissan—is set to begin at the High Court, accusing them of cheating on emissions tests. This trial, part of the 'dieselgate' scandal, alleges the companies used 'defeat devices' to reduce harmful gas emissions during test conditions. Lawyers claim this is the largest class action in English and Welsh legal history, potentially involving 1.6 million car owners. The article notes all five carmakers deny the accusations, asserting their systems are technically and legally justifiable, but a judgment isn't expected until summer 2026.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid 'directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes' when seeking to increase tax revenue in the upcoming Budget. With pressure to meet self-imposed financial rules, the Chancellor is expected to raise taxes, but the IFS warns some options could be 'especially economically harmful.' The article highlights Labour's pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance, or VAT for working people, suggesting wider reforms to property tax and capital gains tax as better, fairer alternatives.
