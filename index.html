          <h2>Small Businesses Seek Tariff Exemptions Amid Rising Import Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 18:13:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small businesses are struggling with the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, arguing that they lack the financial resources to absorb the increased costs. Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration to grant exemptions to these businesses, noting that larger corporations have already been shielded from some of the trade policy impacts. Small business owners express concern that the tariffs could jeopardize their livelihoods, with some facing the possibility of abandoning significant orders due to rising costs. Isabel Guzman highlights the disproportionate impact on small businesses, given their limited cash reserves and supply chain diversity.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the visa of an Ohio State University graduate student, Ahwar Sultan, whose visa was revoked after he was arrested at an anti-Israel protest in 2024. Despite Sultan's charges being dismissed and expunged, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) terminated his student visa. The judge ruled that the administration cannot modify his record based solely on his arrest, but a later hearing will allow DHS officials to explain the reasoning for the status change and clarify if they intend to initiate removal proceedings. This decision follows a similar ruling in Georgia, where a judge ordered the reinstatement of visas for 133 international students.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved $160 billion by cutting wasteful spending, but a new analysis suggests these efforts have cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The Partnership for Public Service (PSP) estimates the costs are associated with putting federal employees on paid leave, rehiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity. The IRS, facing significant workforce cuts, could forego hundreds of billions in tax revenue due to reduced compliance and audits. The White House disputes the analysis, but PSP maintains that the taxpayer costs could continue to grow as cuts ripple through the economy.</p>

          <p>In a reversal, the federal government is restoring the records of international students whose entries in a crucial database were abruptly terminated, complicating their ability to stay in the country. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had been canceling thousands of students' records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), often due to minor disciplinary records. This decision comes after numerous federal lawsuits were filed by affected students, and the government has announced that terminated SEVIS records will be restored, at least temporarily, while a formal policy for revoking records is adopted. Immigration attorneys estimate that close to 5,000 students have had their SEVIS records terminated in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>CBS's '60 Minutes' faces an unprecedented crisis following the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited interference from Paramount Global due to a lawsuit filed by President Trump. Trump alleges that the program deceptively edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. There are concerns that Paramount Global may settle the lawsuit to facilitate a merger with Skydance Media, potentially compromising the program's journalistic integrity. Despite the turmoil, the staff is committed to maintaining the program's hard-charging journalistic values, but uncertainty over corporate support could make it difficult to aggressively cover the Trump White House.</p>

A computer monitor in Hegseth's office was installed to give him remote access to the Signal app and text messages from his personal cellphone, despite cellphones being prohibited in the sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF). This comes after reports that Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group.

          <h2>MercadoLibre CEO Sees Trade War as Opportunity for Latin America</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of MercadoLibre, Marcos Galperin, believes that the U.S.-China trade war presents a significant opportunity for Latin America. He suggests that Latin American firms, especially in Mexico, could benefit from the escalating tensions as American companies move manufacturing operations from China to Mexico. MercadoLibre's shares have surged this year, while Amazon's shares have declined due to its exposure to President Trump's tariffs. Galperin's comments highlight the potential for Latin America to gain from the shifting global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to address the declining U.S. birth rate, which has implications for the nation's long-term economic outlook. Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried similar monetary incentives with mixed results. Experts suggest that tackling long-standing economic issues, such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave, could be more effective. The declining birth rate is attributed to shifting priorities among young adults, who may have different aspirations for life and views about parenting norms.</p>

Summit Therapeutics and BioNTech saw their shares plunge, while Akeso's shares surged. The moves are likely related to Akeso receiving FDA approval for a cancer drug that utilizes similar technology, as well as an additional approval in China. Ivonescimab is a drug that Summit developed in partnership with Akeso, but only Akeso has the rights to the drug in China.</p>

          <p>Pornography has significantly shaped American culture, influencing views on power, relationships, and sexuality. The mainstreaming of sexual content has led to a normalization of regressive treatment, with some arguing that it has inured people to cruelty. While some view sexual openness as empowering, critics argue that the "empowerment" narrative can be used to excuse unsavory aspects of the industry. The prevalence of certain types of porn has created a cultural dominance that leaves little room for alternative perspectives.</p>
