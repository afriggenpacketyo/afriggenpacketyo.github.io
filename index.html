          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing the final day of its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures forecast to reach 31C before a cooler front arrives on Monday. Amber heat-health alerts and an "extreme" wildfire warning remain in effect for parts of England and Scotland, respectively, while hosepipe bans affect millions. The hot weather has led to travel disruptions and prompted water safety warnings from officials, particularly after a 15-year-old boy died in a river in Glasgow. While relief is expected for most of the country, southeastern England may see high temperatures persist into Tuesday.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Defense of Attorney General Bondi Over Epstein Case Sparks Backlash from Supporters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:51:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent defense of Attorney General Pam Bondi has caused a significant backlash within his MAGA base, who are frustrated by the Justice Department's conclusion that no Jeffrey Epstein client list exists. Prominent supporters like Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn and Laura Loomer publicly criticized the administration's stance, arguing the issue of elite child abuse will not disappear and demanding more transparency. Trump, in a social media post, dismissed the focus on Epstein, urged supporters to let Bondi do her job, and suggested the controversy was a distraction created by his political opponents. The internal discord highlights a rare disconnect between Trump and his most ardent followers.</p>

          <h2>"Superman" Film Launches New DC Era with $122 Million Domestic Box Office Debut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:39:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new "Superman" film debuted with a strong $122 million in North American ticket sales, marking a successful launch for the revamped DC Studios under James Gunn and Peter Safran. Globally, the movie earned $217 million, providing a much-needed boost for Warner Bros. after a series of underperforming superhero films. While the opening was robust and received positive reviews from critics and audiences, it fell slightly short of some higher-end projections, with analysts noting heavy market competition. The film's success is seen as crucial for the studio's planned 10-year overhaul of its cinematic universe.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against mounting criticism from his own supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The frustration stems from a Justice Department memo that stated there was no incriminating client list, contrary to long-held expectations within conservative circles. In a social media post, Trump dismissed the ongoing focus on Epstein and urged his base to support Bondi, highlighting a growing rift within his political movement. The controversy also involves a reported feud between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the handling of the case.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant development for player welfare, FIFA has agreed in principle to introduce mandatory rest periods for professional footballers to combat burnout and injury. Following talks with the global players' union, Fifpro, the governing body acknowledged the need for a 72-hour gap between matches and a minimum three-week break at the end of each season. This consensus comes after Fifpro and other unions filed a lawsuit against FIFA for expanding the fixture calendar, particularly with the new 32-team Club World Cup. The agreement is seen as a major first step in addressing the growing physical demands placed on top athletes.</p>

          <p>Years before a devastating flood killed 27 children, buildings at Camp Mystic in Texas were removed from official high-risk flood maps following successful appeals by the camp, according to US media reports. Records from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) reportedly show that the camp, located by the Guadalupe River, was initially designated as being in a high-risk flood zone in 2011. Experts have expressed concern over the decision to grant exemptions to a riverside children's camp, raising questions about safety standards and regulatory oversight. The revelation comes amid broader scrutiny over the lack of adequate warnings before the fatal flash floods.</p>

          <p>A technique known as investigative genetic genealogy is proving to be a revolutionary tool for law enforcement in solving cold cases, famously demonstrated in the capture of the Golden State Killer. The method, pioneered by amateur sleuth and biologist Barbara Rae-Venter, involves using public DNA databases like GED Match to build family trees for unknown suspects from crime scene DNA. This process generates investigative leads that traditional police work can then confirm, leading to the resolution of decades-old murders and sexual assaults. While the practice has raised some privacy concerns, it has been instrumental in bringing long-awaited justice to victims and their families.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is highlighting significant security upgrades designed to prevent a similar incident. The agency has implemented a fleet of military-grade drones for improved aerial surveillance, a capability it lacked when the shooter flew a drone over the rally site. Additionally, new mobile command posts have been established to ensure direct and seamless radio communication between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement, addressing a critical failure from that day. These changes, along with recent personnel suspensions, are part of the agency's effort to rebuild confidence in its protective operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's defense ministry announced on Sunday that its forces have captured the village of Myrne in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, continuing its intensified offensive. This claim of advancing "deep into the enemy's defense" comes as the full-scale war extends beyond its third year, with Moscow recently ramping up its attacks. The report also notes that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has offered his "unconditional support" to Russia. This territorial gain highlights the immense pressure Ukrainian forces are facing on the eastern front amid ongoing battles and stalled peace negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's proposal that "able-bodied" adults on Medicaid could fill labor shortages in the agricultural sector is facing scrutiny from health policy experts. Robin Rudowitz of the health policy organization KFF discussed the practical challenges and flawed assumptions behind this idea, which has been floated as a solution to labor gaps created by an immigration crackdown. The analysis delves into the demographics of the Medicaid population, the nature of farm labor, and the logistical hurdles that make such a replacement highly unlikely. The debate highlights the complex intersection of immigration, labor, and public health policy.</p>

          <p>Representative Don Bacon, a moderate Republican from a Nebraska swing district, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing political exhaustion and the increasingly toxic political environment. A retired Air Force general, Bacon has been a rare GOP voice willing to criticize President Trump and has faced intense harassment and threats from both the far-left and "dark MAGA" elements. His departure is part of a broader trend of moderate Republicans leaving Congress, feeling alienated by the party's direction. Bacon expressed a desire to "fight for the soul of the party" from outside of Congress.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has dropped all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of destroying thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses and giving patients saline shots instead. Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the dismissal, stating that Moore "gave his patients a choice." Moore had been indicted in 2023 for allegedly running a scheme to sell fraudulent vaccination cards and was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. The decision reflects the Trump administration's skeptical stance on COVID-19 vaccines and has been praised by figures like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must adopt a "self-centred" approach and build an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He stated that these organizations should focus on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks to explain Chinese policies and predict future trends. According to Zheng, this shift is necessary to truly articulate China's practices to the world. This perspective emphasizes a move away from Western-centric analysis in favor of developing a distinctively Chinese model for policy research and global communication.</p>

          <p>A political discussion explored the strategic thinking behind two major actions by the Trump administration: the issuance of tariff letters to foreign trading partners and the execution of increasingly forceful immigration raids. The conversation analyzed the political motivations and potential consequences of these policies. Polling data on public sentiment toward the immigration raids was also examined, revealing how Americans are reacting to the administration's hardline approach. The analysis provides insight into the domestic political calculus driving these controversial and high-impact executive actions. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the US-based space awareness firm COMSPOC, the satellites were observed "visually merged" for a prolonged period in early July after a series of close-proximity operations. If confirmed as a refueling, this would represent a significant leap in China's autonomous satellite servicing capabilities, a complex technological feat that the United States has not yet achieved.
