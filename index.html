          <p>The Royal Family is prioritizing the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, hoping to maintain focus on honoring veterans and the significance of the end of World War Two. This comes shortly after Prince Harry's candid BBC interview, where he discussed his strained relationship with his father, King Charles, and his security concerns in the UK after losing a court battle. Commemorations will include events at the Cenotaph, a military procession, and a Buckingham Palace balcony appearance, with King Charles and Queen Camilla leading the nation in remembrance. The Palace hopes nothing detracts from celebrating the wartime generation, especially given Prince Harry's recent comments about his father's health and their estrangement.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn Women About Over-Reliance on Egg Freezing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:05:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular, some experts are cautioning women against viewing it as a guaranteed path to motherhood, highlighting the costs and uncertainties associated with the procedure. Vardit Ravitsky from the Hastings Center emphasizes that egg freezing is a gamble, not a guarantee, and points to the financial and medical risks involved, with a single cycle costing upwards of $12,000 plus annual storage fees. She argues that society should instead focus on policies that support women in having children at younger ages, such as paid parental leave and workplace childcare. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, critics argue this is to keep women at their desks rather than genuinely helping them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly viewed as a way for women to extend their reproductive years, allowing them to pursue education, careers, and personal goals without the pressure of a ticking biological clock. Dr. Tomer Singer notes the rise in younger women freezing their eggs, highlighting its revolutionary potential similar to the birth control pill. Women are freezing their eggs to increase their chances of having a baby when they're older, allowing them not to rush to find partners, and not obsess over the ticking of their biological clocks. Success rates depend on the age at which eggs are frozen and the number of eggs stored, and there is a growing call for gynecologists to discuss egg freezing as a routine option with younger women.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More women are turning to egg freezing to preserve their fertility, a process that involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. The process can cost between $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus annual storage fees, and thawing and fertilization adds another $10,000. Dr. Lucky Sekhon emphasizes that egg quality decreases with age, making the 20s the optimal time to freeze eggs, while Dr. Tomer Singer sees egg freezing as revolutionary as the pill, giving women more control over their reproductive timelines. While some companies are starting to cover the costs, many women still pay out of pocket, viewing it as an investment in their future reproductive options.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed orders targeting several law firms connected to cases involving him or his allies, threatening their existence and raising concerns about the rule of law. These orders could bar attorneys from courthouses and cancel contracts of law firm clients, leading to significant pressure on these firms. Attorney Donald Ayer argues that these actions violate constitutional rights, while Marc Elias describes them as intimidation tactics reminiscent of a mob boss. Four firms are fighting back in court, while others have made deals with the administration, leading to resignations and a divided legal community.</p>
