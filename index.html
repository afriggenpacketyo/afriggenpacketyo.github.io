          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules for UBS that would require the banking giant to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures are designed to bolster UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of government bailouts in future crises. The Swiss National Bank supports the proposal, stating that it would significantly strengthen UBS's stability and ability to stabilize itself during times of financial distress. The new regulations would also necessitate UBS to fully capitalize its foreign units and reduce its share buybacks, ensuring greater financial prudence and stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates from 21% to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling that inflationary pressures are beginning to ease. Inflation in April was seasonally adjusted to 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank stated that while domestic demand still exceeds the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path. Monetary policy will remain tight for an extended period to reach the 4% inflation target, as Russia's economy has faced immense strain since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

          <p>The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing to reverse its ban on offering crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, aiming to position the U.K. as a global hub for digital assets. Crypto ETNs are debt instruments linked to cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to gain exposure through regulated exchanges. The FCA initially banned these in 2019 due to consumer harm concerns, but now seeks to support U.K. growth and competitiveness by lifting the ban, while restrictions on crypto derivatives will remain. This move is praised by crypto firms as a significant step for the U.K.'s crypto industry, which has lagged behind the U.S. and EU. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The partnership between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has dissolved following a public disagreement, ending a nearly year-long alliance. Musk, who previously supported Trump and served as one of his top advisors, has criticized Trump's proposed tax and immigration bill. Trump responded by questioning Musk's mental state and suggesting the termination of government contracts with Musk's companies, escalating the conflict. The fallout reflects deeper tensions and differing viewpoints on policy and governance between the two figures.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are currently high, but potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still secure favorable rates, particularly with a strong credit score. As of June 6, 2025, the average rate for a 15-year mortgage is 6.14% and 6.97% for a 30-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.17% and 6.90% respectively. Experts suggest that if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, mortgage rates may stabilize, providing relief to borrowers. Improving credit profiles and shopping around for different lenders can also help secure better terms, so consider all the details of any new loan against your existing mortgage to ensure long-term savings.

          <p>A security guard was shot and wounded during a struggle in the emergency room of Evanston Hospital, a suburb of Chicago, after a man suffering from a mental health issue became agitated. The man was initially approached by the Crisis Alternative Response Evanston team and agreed to be taken to the hospital for treatment. The incident occurred when the man lunged for his belongings, revealing a weapon, leading to a struggle with security personnel. The emergency room was briefly put on lockdown, and the 28-year-old man is now in police custody.</p>

          <p>A provision within Donald Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' could open thousands of acres near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters wilderness to a foreign-owned mining company. The bill, if approved, would grant Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of Antofagasta PLC, mining leases in perpetuity, overriding federal laws and regulations. Conservationists fear this move will lead to water pollution and irreversible damage to the pristine wilderness area. The proposed copper and nickel mine poses a significant threat of acid mine drainage, potentially impacting the area's unique ecosystem and outdoor recreation economy.</p>

          <p>Tesla stock is showing signs of recovery in pre-market trading after a sharp decline caused by a public dispute between Elon Musk and President Trump.

          <p>A review of Bruce Handy's 'Hollywood High' explores how teen movies have long captured both rebellious teen experiences and adult anxieties. From the carefree partying in 'Dazed and Confused' to the stark realities in 'Eighth Grade,' these films reflect changing societal concerns. Early films focused on youth delinquency, while more recent movies address issues like social media's influence and mental health. Teenagers now create their own content, potentially making traditional teen movies less relevant, but the genre continues to evolve alongside adolescent culture.</p>

          <p>The UK has shifted its stance on the Western Sahara conflict, endorsing Morocco's autonomy plan as the "most credible" position.

Experts note the UK's position retains some flexibility compared to France's firm support for Morocco. The UK's shift may reflect growing economic interests in Morocco, particularly as a gateway to Africa, while Algeria's gas supply role hasn't significantly strengthened its position on the issue.</p>

          <p>The Glazer family's 20-year ownership of Manchester United has cost the club an estimated £1.2 billion, largely due to debt interest repayments, dividends, and management fees. Since taking full control in June 2005, the Glazers' leveraged buyout loaded significant debt onto the club, leading to substantial cash outflows. Calculations based on the club's accounts reveal that over £815 million has been paid in debt interest, £166 million in dividends, and £10 million in fees to Glazer family companies. The takeover has been controversial from the start, provoking ongoing protests from fans concerned about the club's financial health.</p>
