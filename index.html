          <p>Liberal and pro-EU candidate Nicusor Dan has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. The election followed months of political instability, including the annulment of a previous presidential race due to alleged Russian interference. Dan secured 54% of the vote, emphasizing unity and change for Romania. Simion, despite a strong showing in the diaspora, conceded victory. Supporters of Dan expressed relief and optimism for a pro-European future. Relevant context: This election occurred amidst broader discontent with mainstream parties and government instability in Romania, an EU and NATO member state.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., at 82 years old, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones.

          <p>The House Budget Committee has advanced President Trump's domestic policy bill, overcoming initial opposition from conservative Republicans concerned about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications, allowing the bill to move forward with four conservative holdouts voting present. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while increasing spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The bill now heads to the Rules Committee, but faces potential challenges from both conservatives seeking deeper cuts and moderates concerned about state and local tax deductions.</p>

Conservatives had opposed aspects of the legislation's crackdown on Medicaid and green energy subsidies, while moderates pushed for larger state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps.

          <p>While former President Joseph R. Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis is serious, advances in treatment and diagnosis have significantly improved survival rates for men with advanced disease. Prostate cancer specialists emphasize that life expectancy is now measured in years, not months, due to research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Department. The first line of attack involves cutting off testosterone, and new scans allow doctors to spot the cancer much earlier. Federal research money, including Biden's cancer moonshot effort, has contributed to this progress, with survival rates almost tripling in the last decade.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes have struck the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions since Friday, killing at least 28 people, with Kentucky and Missouri being particularly hard hit. The storms, part of an especially brutal spring, have devastated communities still recovering from previous severe weather events. A preliminary count showed that 26 tornadoes had touched down, mostly in Indiana and Kentucky. The storms have added to the strain on federal weather and emergency management workers already facing recent staffing and funding cuts. The town of London, Kentucky and St. Louis, Missouri were particularly hard hit.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway after a Mexican Navy ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to others. The accident occurred as the ship was departing Pier 17 in Manhattan, with authorities citing mechanical issues as the cause of the ship veering off course. Senator Schumer has questioned the role of a tugboat and whether cuts to the Coast Guard may have contributed to the incident. The ship, now docked at Pier 36, was on a mission to promote peace and goodwill.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have resulted in the deaths of at least 103 people, prompting the closure of the main hospital in northern Gaza. The strikes, which targeted areas in and around Khan Younis and Jabaliya refugee camp, have led to numerous casualties, including children and women. The Israeli military stated that troops were operating against terror infrastructure sites in northern Gaza. Mediators from the U.S. and Qatar are attempting to reach a deal for a ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages, but Hamas has refused to leave Gaza or disarm.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached to end New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years, just three days after it began. The strike, involving passenger-train drivers, was called off at about 6 p.m. on Sunday, with NJ Transit announcing that trains would resume a full schedule on Tuesday morning. The main sticking point had been the engineers' demand for pay on par with their counterparts at other passenger railroads. A tentative agreement was reached that is "fair to NJ Transit's employees while also being affordable for our state's commuters and taxpayers."</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer at age 82, with the cancer having spread to his bones. The diagnosis came with a Gleason score of 9, indicating an aggressive form of the disease. While prostate cancer is often curable if identified early, in Biden's case, the goal is to control the disease, slow progression, and preserve quality of life. Treatment options include hormone therapy, androgen blockers, chemotherapy, and bone-targeted treatments. This underscores the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. Bartkus, who had "nihilistic ideations," is believed to have targeted the clinic, with officials calling the bombing an act of terrorism. Investigators are examining writings that could be related to the attack, which damaged several blocks downtown. Bartkus's father said his son had a history of tinkering with explosives and had a troubled past. The incident has raised concerns about the targeting of fertility clinics.</p>

          <p>GPs in England will assist the NHS in identifying more victims of the contaminated blood scandal by offering hepatitis C tests to patients who received blood transfusions before 1996. Thousands of people may have been exposed to the virus through contaminated blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Hepatitis C can now be treated with modern anti-viral drugs, but if undetected, it can cause serious liver damage. The move comes after the BBC highlighted the scale of undiagnosed cases and the lack of testing following the infected blood scandal.</p>

Until then, New Jersey Transit will rely on its original strike contingency plan involving supplemental buses. The agency's chief executive urged those who could work remotely to stay home on Monday to ease the transition.</p>

          <p>The United States is likely to introduce region-based tariffs instead of individual duty rates for many countries, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The Trump administration aims to strike deals with select key trading partners on its sweeping reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. The administration is focusing on 18 important trading relationships, with the possibility of another 20 strong relationships, and will enforce the same tariff rates prior to the pause if those trading partners do not negotiate in good faith.</p>
