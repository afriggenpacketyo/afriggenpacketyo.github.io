Ocasio-Cortez asserted her right to free speech and challenged Homan to take action, stating she was not intimidated by his threats. Her office previously hosted a webinar advising migrants about their rights when facing ICE agents, leading Homan to suggest she might be impeding law enforcement. The congresswoman also criticized the Trump administration's approach to border security, labeling deportations of Venezuelan gang members as sanctioned kidnappings. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel the New Jersey state police to permit mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used to send ransom notes in the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. The case, in which Charles Lindbergh's son was kidnapped and murdered, led to the conviction of Bruno Hauptmann, though his guilt has always been debated. Researchers believe that saliva on the envelopes could reveal whether Hauptmann acted alone or with others. The state police have cited concerns about damaging the evidence as the reason for denying access, but the plaintiffs argue that modern forensic techniques can prevent damage and help uncover the truth.

The situation is complicated by the potential for tariffs to be revoked, making it unclear whether price increases can be sustained.

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is designed to teach aides to avoid using elderspeak, a form of baby talk directed at older adults. Elderspeak, characterized by endearments, simplified language, and controlling tones, arises from ageist assumptions of frailty and incompetence. Studies show that exposure to elderspeak can lead to resistance to care and other negative behaviors. The CHAT program has been shown to reduce elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes.

Some who were skeptical of the Maga movement embraced policies such as federal spending cuts and harsher illegal migration policies. The president has spent the first 100 days since his inauguration issuing a flurry of executive orders and making a series of policy moves that have dominated the global news and politics agenda and raised fears of autocracy in America and a fundamental shifting of the international order.
