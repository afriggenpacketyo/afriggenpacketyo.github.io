          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. experienced a significant increase of 76% in April, contrasting with a 76% drop in shipments from China, as Apple adapts to Washington's tariffs. This shift reflects Apple's strategic investments in India's supply chains, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic, to mitigate the impact of trade tensions. However, analysts predict that this growth may plateau due to India's manufacturing capacity not expanding quickly enough to meet total U.S. demand, potentially facing further pushback from both Washington and Beijing regarding Apple's tariff mitigation strategies. Despite Trump's threats of tariffs on iPhones made outside the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook has reiterated plans to manufacture most iPhones sold in the U.S. in India (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Mary Earps, the England goalkeeper, has announced her retirement from international football just five weeks before Euro 2025, where England will defend their title. Earps, who is 32 years old, made 53 senior appearances for England over eight years and played a vital role in England's Euro 2022 victory and their journey to the 2023 Women's World Cup final. She recently lost her starting position to Hannah Hampton but was still wanted as part of the squad by England manager Sarina Wiegman. Earps expressed that this is the right time for her to step aside and allow the younger generation to thrive, while also expressing her support for the team in Euro 2025 and wishing them success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has pushed people into poverty, but also warned that removing the cap would be costly. A decision is expected in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of the government's child poverty strategy, which has been delayed until autumn, with Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall leading the Child Poverty Taskforce putting together the strategy. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would never have introduced the cap, signaling a potential shift in priorities and choices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to Donald Trump's anti-"woke" policies, several U.S. corporations have reduced or eliminated their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, leading European companies to face similar pressures. Some German companies, including Volkswagen and Deutsche Telekom, are scaling back or ending their DEI initiatives in the U.S., while SAP has abandoned gender quotas in Germany. Despite this trend, a survey by Germany's Charta der Vielfalt indicates that many German companies remain committed to DEI, with 90% intending to continue their programs unchanged. Some US companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Costco have also reaffirmed their support for DEI, despite the backlash, with about 75% of US companies having not changed their diversity efforts.</p>

Dacus, who has experience working at various Japanese companies and even at a 7-Eleven store in the U.S. during his teenage years, replaces Ryuichi Isaka.

          <p>A car-ramming incident in Liverpool, England, injured nearly 50 people, including four children, during a celebration parade for Liverpool F.C.'s Premier League title. The British police have arrested a 53-year-old white British man, and are not treating the incident as terrorism, aiming to prevent misinformation. Video footage shows a dark-colored vehicle swerving into the crowd, with witnesses attempting to stop the vehicle.

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the U.S. to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to engage in meaningful peace talks, as drone strikes continue in both Ukraine and Russia. Zelenskyy condemned the increasing scale and brazenness of Russian strikes, asserting that they lack military logic and reflect Putin's choice to prolong the war and destroy lives. He called for new, stronger sanctions from the U.S., Europe, and other nations seeking peace to compel Russia to cease fire and demonstrate respect in negotiations. Despite months of U.S.-brokered peace talks, a lasting ceasefire remains elusive, and Zelenskyy has expressed skepticism about a Russian memorandum outlining their negotiating position.</p>

In a similar incident last summer, false reports about the assailant's identity spread rapidly online, leading to riots, so the police were keen to avoid a repeat.

They argue that eliminating this watchdog would increase the risk of corporate disasters, emphasizing the importance of the PCAOB's independence and its role in ensuring audit quality. They highlight that the PCAOB's rigorous inspections and enforcement have improved audit credibility and uncovered deficiencies, while its operational independence from the SEC is crucial for maintaining a laser focus on audit oversight. The authors emphasize that the P.C.A.O.B. was built to protect trust and that if itâ€™s allowed to erode, we will all pay the price from market volatility, higher borrowing costs and potentially taxpayer-funded cleanup efforts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes President Trump's redecoration of the Oval Office, describing it as a "gilded rococo hellscape" that reflects an American fascination with wealth and royalty. The author traces the history of Rococo design, noting its association with both European royal courts and the American bourgeoisie, suggesting that Trump's aesthetic choices are deeply American, combining a desire for grandeur with a populist sensibility. The essay explores the historical context of Rococo in America, from its presence in pre-revolutionary homes to its revival in the late 20th century, arguing that Trump's embrace of the style is a reflection of America's complex relationship with wealth and power.</p>

          <p>Zachary Levi says that publicly endorsing President Donald Trump has made him a Hollywood outsider, with some people preferring not to work with him due to his political views. Despite this, he also notes that some on the conservative side are more inclined to hire him because of his stance. Levi acknowledges that many in Hollywood secretly voted for Trump but are afraid to express their views publicly. He encourages "closeted conservatives" to speak out, arguing that the industry backlash has eroded, and that it is now or never to express their beliefs.</p>

          <p>Corporate America's shift away from diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives has resulted in the elimination of thousands of jobs, disproportionately affecting women and people of color. Companies like Verizon, Walmart, and Target have ended or renamed DEI programs, leading to a decline in job postings related to diversity and inclusion. This trend reflects a growing backlash against DEI from conservative influencers and officials, who argue that such programs are discriminatory, though some companies remain committed to the underlying goals of creating more opportunities for all workers. As a result, many DEI professionals are facing prolonged unemployment and a shrinking job market.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration could jeopardize after-school programs that serve low-income students, such as the REACH Afterschool Program in rural Maine. These programs offer enriching activities and academic support that students in these communities might not otherwise have access to, improving attendance and academic outcomes. The potential loss of funding would disproportionately affect low-income and rural districts, which rely more heavily on federal funds to provide these essential services. The REACH program director, Dawn Fickett, says that the loss of after-school programs would be a blow for students in the Skowhegan area, where the program has led to impressive academic and other gains.</p>

He defends the university's efforts to address antisemitism and promote viewpoint diversity, while emphasizing the vital role of international students and research universities in serving the nation and the world.

          <p>The ITV soap Emmerdale is tackling the issue of cervical cancer with a storyline involving a young character's diagnosis, aiming to raise awareness about the importance of early detection and regular medical check-ups. Cervical cancer is caused by certain high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), a common virus that most sexually active people will contract at some point in their lives, with other risk factors including having HIV, other STIs, smoking, and a family history of the disease. Cervical screening is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix aged 25 to 64 on the NHS, and early diagnosis significantly improves the chances of effective treatment.</p>

The Journal suggests that Senate Republicans can act independently of Trump to force him to confront the reality of Putin's ambitions, and challenge Trump's stalled bid for peace.</p>
