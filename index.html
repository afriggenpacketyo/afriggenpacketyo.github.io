        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks is implementing a significant $1 billion restructuring plan, involving the closure of underperforming stores and the elimination of approximately 900 non-retail partner roles. This strategic move, part of the "Back to Starbucks" initiative, aims to enhance customer experience and financial performance by focusing resources closer to operations. While the overall North American store count is projected to slightly decline in fiscal year 2025, the company plans to renovate over 1,000 existing locations and expand its total store footprint in fiscal year 2026. These difficult decisions are considered essential for building a stronger, more resilient Starbucks and fostering long-term growth.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 10:11:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes remained largely flat in August, experiencing a marginal 0.2% drop from July, as reported by the National Association of Realtors. This market stagnation is attributed to higher mortgage rates prevalent in the months when these sales typically closed. While the luxury segment of the market saw an 8% year-over-year increase, the availability of affordable homes continued to be constrained by a persistent lack of inventory. The overall supply of homes for sale also saw its first monthly decline this year, contributing to a 2% annual rise in the median home price to $422,600, marking the 26th consecutive month of such gains.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a stark warning to Kremlin leaders, advising them to familiarize themselves with bomb shelters, following his address to the United Nations General Assembly. Zelenskyy asserted he had President Trump's express permission to strike Russian energy and infrastructure targets, and also requested an unnamed weapons system from the U.S., believing it would compel Vladimir Putin to negotiate. He underscored Ukraine's unwavering resolve to retaliate against any attacks, stating that if Russia does not halt the war, its leaders will inevitably need those shelters. This article highlights the escalating rhetoric and strategic posturing in the ongoing conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump is reportedly adopting elements of Beijing's industrial policy playbook in the intensifying US-China economic rivalry, particularly concerning strategic industries like defense technology and advanced electronics. Experts suggest this reflects a growing realization in Washington that relying solely on commercial market forces may not secure adequate domestic supply capacity for critical inputs. Escalating geopolitical tensions are cited as a key factor driving U.S. government concerns over potential supply chain disruptions for essential goods such as semiconductors and critical minerals. This article highlights a notable shift towards a more interventionist policy approach in American economic strategy.</p>

          <p>The powerful James Webb Space Telescope has unveiled stunning new images of Sagittarius B2, the Milky Way's most active star-forming region, situated near the supermassive black hole at the galactic center. These unprecedented views, captured by the telescope's infrared instruments, reveal a vibrant array of stars and cosmic dust, offering detailed insights into the process of star formation. Astronomers are now studying the newly observed stars to understand their age and size, while also investigating the paradox of why star formation in this central region is comparatively low. The article highlights how these images are pushing the boundaries of human understanding of the cosmos.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Gen Z population has erupted in widespread anti-government protests, fueled by decades of perceived corruption, political stagnation, and stark economic inequality. The demonstrations, which gained momentum after social media posts highlighted the lavish lifestyles of the elite, tragically turned violent after police opened fire on crowds, resulting in 19 deaths, including one protester's brother. Despite the violence and claims of infiltration by outsiders, the youth remain resolute, with many now discussing forming a new political party to usher in a democratic overhaul and new leadership.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has pledged to actively prevent any attempts to ban Israel from participating in the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host alongside Mexico and Canada. This firm stance comes amid increasing international calls for sporting sanctions against Israel, following a UN commission of inquiry's report alleging genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and a panel of UN experts have openly advocated for such bans, drawing parallels to Russia's suspension from international sports. The article details the significant geopolitical pressure on FIFA and UEFA, though UEFA denies any immediate meeting is planned to discuss Israel's suspension.</p>

Despite the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut citing "downside risks to employment," companies appear reluctant to part with workers.

          <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly nearing a decision on whether to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a long-standing adversary of President Trump. The investigation has reportedly focused on whether Comey lied to Congress in 2020 regarding the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, with the statute of limitations for such a charge expiring imminently. The potential charges would mark a dramatic escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to target political foes, raising concerns among legal experts about presidential pressure influencing prosecutorial judgment. This article highlights a politically charged legal development with significant implications for the justice system's independence.</p>

          <p>FEMA's acting administrator was reportedly largely unreachable after deadly flooding swept through Texas in July, significantly hindering the agency's ability to deploy crucial search-and-rescue resources promptly. This alleged lack of communication compounded existing criticism of FEMA's slow response to the disaster, which tragically claimed over 130 lives. Furthermore, relief efforts were impacted by a new policy requiring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's personal approval for any expenditure over $100,000. This article highlights severe concerns about government accountability and effectiveness in disaster response, leading to calls for the acting administrator's resignation amidst the criticisms.</p>

It advises consumers to seek out online banks for the most competitive rates, which often significantly outpace national averages. Additionally, short-term CDs, typically ranging from six months to one year, are noted to have higher interest rates due to an inverted yield curve, suggesting a laddering strategy for long-term savings.

          <p>President Trump and Republicans are attempting to rebrand the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" as the "Working Families Tax Cut" due to its widespread unpopularity and public disapproval. However, this article argues that analysis reveals the rebranding is misleading, as the bill disproportionately benefits the wealthiest 5% of households, with the top 0.1% receiving substantial annual tax cuts. Conversely, many working families are projected to face net losses due to significant cuts in health coverage, food assistance, and federal aid for college. Critics contend that the bill, combined with Trump's tariffs, will ultimately leave 90% of American families financially worse off. (not investment advice)</p>
