          <p>During a joint press conference in Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump used the platform to extensively promote his Turnberry golf resort. While standing alongside UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump praised the "opulent and beautiful" renovations at his property. The event has drawn criticism over the blending of official duties with personal business interests, especially as the Scottish government is considering public funding for another of Trump's resorts.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark, a major U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, has removed the weight-loss drug Zepbound from its preferred list, replacing it with Wegovy due to rising costs. This change has forced many patients to switch medications, causing concern and frustration, as some experienced better results or fewer side effects with Zepbound. While both drugs are effective, clinical trials suggest Zepbound may lead to greater weight loss, and the switch disrupts continuity of care for many individuals.</p>

          <p>China has offered to strengthen economic ties with Brazil, positioning itself as a key partner just before new U.S. tariffs on Brazilian exports are scheduled to take effect. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated Beijing's willingness to work with Brazil to uphold the global multilateral trading system. The statement specifically mentioned expanding cooperation in the aviation sector, as Brazil's aircraft manufacturer Embraer is heavily reliant on the U.S. market and faces financial uncertainty from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has announced it will furlough approximately 270 pilots and demote another 140 captains as the budget carrier continues its efforts to regain profitability. The workforce reduction is a necessary step to align staffing with a downsized flight schedule as the airline undergoes a major business overhaul. This move comes after the Florida-based company emerged from bankruptcy protection earlier this year and seeks to rebrand itself as a more premium airline.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear her appeal, arguing her 2021 sex trafficking conviction should be voided.

The defense argues that the government's promise of immunity must be honored to maintain trust in the justice system, a point they are pressing with both the court and the president.</p>
