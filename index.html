            <p>Devastating attacks on the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps in Sudan's Darfur region, home to hundreds of thousands displaced by civil war, have resulted in the deaths of over 100 civilians, including children and aid workers. Residents describe the situation as catastrophic, with ongoing shelling and closed escape routes, with the UN and US condemning the violence attributed to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The attacks, coinciding with the second anniversary of the civil war, exacerbate famine-like conditions in the camps, where over 700,000 people seek refuge. Relief International reported the deaths of nine of its workers, alleging a targeted attack on health infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the recent tariff exemptions for electronic devices are only temporary, clarifying the administration's intention to implement "semiconductor tariffs" in the near future to encourage domestic production. Lutnick emphasized the need for the U.S. to be self-reliant in key industries like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, deeming them critical for national security. The exemptions were initially outlined in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin, covering items like smartphones and computers, but will soon be replaced by tariffs specifically targeting the semiconductor industry to incentivize reshoring efforts. This move aims to reduce dependence on foreign countries for essential goods and bolster American manufacturing capabilities.</p>

            <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer faced online criticism after a photo surfaced showing her seemingly shielding her face with a folder during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. The incident occurred during a discussion about recovery efforts following an ice storm, funding for the Selfridge Air National Guard base, Great Lakes protections, and the automobile industry. Whitmer later stated she was surprised by the press conference, expecting a one-on-one meeting, while online users offered varied interpretations, some suggesting it reflected the Democratic Party's current state. Whitmer's visit also included a "Build, America, Build" address, advocating for bipartisan cooperation to strengthen American manufacturing and addressing concerns about tariffs affecting Michigan's auto industry.</p>

            <p>An Israeli airstrike has severely damaged the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, the last fully functional hospital in the area, destroying its intensive care and surgery departments. The IDF claimed the hospital housed a Hamas command center, taking measures to mitigate harm to civilians, though these claims are disputed. The strike forced the evacuation of patients and staff, with one child reportedly dying due to the rushed evacuation, according to the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem. The Anglican Church, which runs the hospital, condemned the attack, while Hamas accused Israel of committing a horrific crime, with the UK Foreign Minister calling for an end to attacks on medical facilities.</p>

The author argues that this trend is driven by tough economic times and the need for women to secure financial independence and control over their revenue streams. While acknowledging the problematic aspects of the original girlboss movement, the author respects the hustle of these contemporary female entrepreneurs in a challenging economic landscape.</p>

            <p>A financial therapist suggests that struggles with budgeting and financial control may stem from emotional attachment styles rather than a lack of self-control. The three main attachment styles—anxious, avoidant, and secure—influence financial behaviors, with anxious individuals clinging tightly to money out of fear and avoidant individuals ignoring finances to avoid stress. The therapist recommends strategies for each style, such as setting boundaries for anxious individuals and starting small for avoidant individuals, to foster a healthier relationship with money. Understanding one's emotional blueprint can be key to long-term financial well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The article argues that American universities need a new social contract with the public, emphasizing civic strength alongside national security and economic competitiveness. It critiques the current focus on STEM education at the expense of civic education, leading to a decline in public trust and understanding of democratic institutions. The author proposes reforms including a new approach to innovation, college admissions, and a focus on pluralism and civic education to restore public faith in higher education. It also calls for a new business model for universities that reduces dependence on federal funding and fosters greater public support.</p>

            <p>The World Trade Center Health Program, providing free healthcare to 9/11 responders and survivors, faces turmoil due to ongoing federal health department restructuring. Services have been cut and restored multiple times, causing anxiety among those relying on the program for cancer treatment, PTSD support, and basic check-ups. The lack of information and transparency surrounding the cuts has been criticized as bureaucratic cruelty, leaving survivors uncertain about the future of their healthcare. The program, run by the CDC under NIOSH, has been significantly impacted by workforce reductions, leading to concerns about its ability to continue providing essential services.</p>

            <p>The United States is seeking collaboration with South Korea to enhance its shipbuilding capacity, aiming to counter China's rapid naval build-up. South Korean shipbuilding giant HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) signed a memorandum of understanding with US firm Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) to cooperate on shipbuilding efficiency and technology. The "ship alliance" aims to improve shipbuilding costs, delivery times, and promote process automation, including the introduction of robots and artificial intelligence. This move could strengthen US power projection in the region and bolster its naval capabilities.</p>

            <p>The article examines the increasing demands placed on grandparents in modern America, where they are often expected to provide extensive childcare due to economic pressures and cultural shifts. Many grandparents, like Elena, are sacrificing their retirement plans to become full-time caregivers, facing challenges such as exhaustion and financial strain. While active grandparenting offers benefits, it can also lead to losses in personal freedom and opportunities for older adults. The author argues that a lack of social safety nets and increasing expectations for intensive parenting contribute to this trend, calling for greater support for families and a recognition of the limits of grandparental care.</p>

            <p>The article explores the growing trend of female-led podcasts that mimic casual conversations between best friends, creating a parasocial connection with listeners. Podcasts like Giggly Squad, hosted by reality stars Paige DeSorbo and Hannah Berner, have gained popularity by offering intimate and relatable discussions about dating, sex, and mental health. This "group chat" phenomenon extends to podcasts hosted by sisters and work colleagues, reflecting a broader cultural shift towards valuing female friendship as a commercial enterprise. The success of these podcasts lies in their accessibility, relatability, and ability to foster a sense of community among listeners.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The article argues that President Trump's tariff policies will disproportionately harm low-income Americans by raising prices on everyday goods and increasing the likelihood of a recession. Tariffs act as a consumption tax, leading to higher costs for essential items, with lower-income households spending a larger share of their income on these price hikes. The potential for a recession further threatens low-income families, who are more vulnerable to job loss and wage stagnation. While there are potential avenues for change through Congress or the courts, the quickest solution relies on Trump reversing his policies.</p>
