          <p>The NAACP, NEA, and other groups are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.  The lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions, including transferring key functions to other departments, constitute a de facto dismantling of the department and risk harming millions of students and educators.  The coalition argues this undermines vital support for vulnerable student populations.</p>

          <p>Fast-food restaurants are increasingly offering innovative beverages with unique flavors and bright colors to appeal to younger consumers, particularly Gen Z.  This trend reflects a broader industry shift toward beverage-focused concepts and a decline in soda consumption.
