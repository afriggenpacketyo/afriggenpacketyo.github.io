          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its H20 chips, designed for the Chinese market, contain any "back doors" that would allow for remote access or control. The statement follows an inquiry from China's cyberspace regulator, the CAC, which summoned the company over potential security vulnerabilities. This development adds to the complex challenges Nvidia faces in navigating the technological rivalry between the U.S. and China, as it attempts to serve the Chinese market while complying with American export restrictions. The company's shares saw a slight dip following the news of the regulatory interview.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has expressed shock and dismay over President Trump's comment that Epstein had "stolen" her from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, they argued the term objectifies Giuffre and downplays the reality that she was preyed upon at Trump's property. The family is calling for more answers regarding what was known at the time and is urging that Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, not receive clemency. This renewed focus on the case follows a recent interview of Maxwell by the Justice Department.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, named the Rhisotope Project, involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. Led by the University of the Witwatersrand, the project aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports, thereby disrupting trafficking networks. Researchers have confirmed the process is safe for the animals but effective in triggering security alarms, even when horns are hidden in large shipping containers. This innovative strategy hopes to protect the country's dwindling rhino population, which is heavily targeted for the illegal horn trade.</p>

Despite a challenging season in the MLS, the Galaxy showcased a strong offensive performance with goals from Matheus Nascimento, Gabriel Pec, Marco Reus, and a brace from Joseph Paintsil. The Ghanaian forward was a standout player, also recovering from a missed penalty to lead his team's attack. For Tijuana, young player Gilberto Mora scored both of his team's goals in a hard-fought contest.</p>

It details the devastating impact on her husband, Stephan Weiler, and her opponent, Heather Schmitz, who was initially investigated for homicide. The report connects Zerlentes' story with that of another boxer's partner, highlighting the lack of institutional support for families after such tragedies. It also explores the broader risks of brain injuries in combat sports, like CTE, urging greater awareness for athletes.</p>

          <p>A trend analysis suggests the focus of the international space industry is increasingly shifting from the Moon to Mars, viewing lunar missions as a "stepping stone" rather than a final destination. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration, with plans for a sustainable human presence, the long-term strategic goal for nations like the U.S. and China is Mars. The article notes that private companies are filling the gap in lunar logistics through programs like NASA's CLPS. This pivot marks a new phase in the space race, with Mars seen as the ultimate prize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a widespread black-market rental sector in London, where tenants live in dangerously overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Reporters found unlicensed Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) with issues like black mould, rat infestations, and severe overcrowding, which in one case led to a fatal fire. Data analysis suggests that in some boroughs, illegal HMOs may outnumber licensed ones by a significant margin. The report highlights the vulnerability of tenants, the overstretched capacity of local councils to enforce regulations, and the immense profits made by rogue landlords.</p>

The move solidifies Bukele's power, which he has consolidated since first taking office in 2019.

The author, Carolin Würfel, reflects on her own experiences and those of her peers, noting a pattern where women in creative fields often work as freelancers with little long-term security, while male counterparts are more likely to have stable, permanent jobs. She argues that the economic system relies on women's underpaid labor and flexibility, leading to a significant gender gap in income and retirement savings.

The decision by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll followed a social media campaign by pro-Trump activist Laura Loomer, who accused Easterly of undermining the Trump administration. Easterly called the reversal a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage," expressing disappointment that she could not serve at her alma mater. This marks another instance where an appointment has been revoked following pressure from political activists.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Healthcare Failures Are Not Australia's Fault, Argues Columnist</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States should look at its own systemic failures rather than blaming countries like Australia for its high prescription drug costs. The author, John Quiggin, points out that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse health outcomes. While President Trump has labeled countries with price controls like Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as "freeloaders," the article suggests the U.S. could adopt similar models to control its own costs. The author concludes that Australia should treat the U.S. as a tough trading partner rather than a simple ally.</p>

          <p>In her first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is "broken." Explaining her recent decision not to run for governor of California, Harris stated she does not want to go back into "the system" for now, as she feels it is not strong enough to defend fundamental principles. Instead, she plans to travel the country and speak with Americans outside of a transactional, political context. Colbert described her assessment as "harrowing," to which Harris replied that the system's brokenness is "evident."</p>

CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company's focus on security and noted that supply constraints, particularly for power, remain a challenge amid rising AI demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The convictions, which include a 10-year term for opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, are a significant blow to the opposition party. The protests erupted after Khan's arrest on corruption charges and led to violent clashes across the country. The PTI has denounced the rulings as politically motivated and a "black day for democracy," vowing to challenge the verdict in a higher court.</p>

The government has also increased the maximum maintenance loans available to students to help with rising living costs. The fee hike comes after universities warned of significant financial pressures due to years of frozen fees and high inflation, with many expecting to run a deficit. The article also notes that student housing costs have risen sharply, with maintenance loans in England now barely covering the average rent, forcing more students into part-time work.

This strategy contrasts with selling off assets to build for the future, a move many analysts expected.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House, with a projected cost of $200 million. President Trump stated the new facility, which will replace the current East Wing, is needed to host large-scale events that currently require tents on the South Lawn. Funding for the project will reportedly come from Trump himself and other "patriot donors," with the president calling it "his gift to the country." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>
