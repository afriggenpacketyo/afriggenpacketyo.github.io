          <p>Adobe reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, surpassing analysts' expectations for both earnings and revenue. The design software company's revenue grew by 11% year-over-year, and it provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, also exceeding market predictions. This positive performance led to a rise in Adobe's stock price during extended trading, offering a bright spot for a stock that had underperformed its tech peers throughout the year. The company also raised its full-year growth forecast for its digital media business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The search for the next Federal Reserve chair is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent interviewing several candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is also advocating for a reform agenda at the central bank, aiming to reduce its economic footprint and organically shrink its large bond portfolio without disrupting markets. This process occurs as the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed for an interest rate cut, with a decision widely expected at the upcoming committee meeting. The leadership transition could significantly alter the Fed's direction in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen to their lowest point in almost a year, with the average 30-year term now at 6.35%. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield, creating a potential opportunity for homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The article advises potential borrowers to assess why rates are falling and whether to act now or wait for a further potential drop, acknowledging the risk that rates could rise again. It emphasizes that for a refinance to be worthwhile, the new rate should be significantly lower to offset closing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in prison for her role in a federal bribery case. She was convicted of accepting bribes, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car, in exchange for her husband's political influence. During sentencing, the judge acknowledged her health issues and personal history but emphasized her central role in the scheme, rejecting the defense's portrayal of her as an innocent observer.

          <p>A majority of Brazil's Supreme Court has found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. The court determined that the plot culminated in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his supporters, convicting him on five charges including attempting to violently abolish democratic rule. Bolsonaro, who maintains his innocence and calls the trial a "witch hunt," could face a prison sentence of more than 40 years. The verdict is a landmark decision in Brazilian politics, addressing a direct challenge to its democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over whether classic literature by authors like Goethe should be replaced with more contemporary and diverse works in school curricula.

While education officials have made some moves to include more female and modern authors, systemic change is slow.

          <p>A California bill aiming to ban PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in products like nonstick cookware has created a conflict between environmental advocates, including actor Mark Ruffalo, and a group of celebrity chefs. The legislation would phase out the chemicals due to links to negative health effects. Chefs such as Rachael Ray and Thomas Keller argue that the nonstick coating PTFE, a type of PFAS, is safe when used correctly and that a ban could make home cooking more difficult. Environmental groups counter that everyday use can release harmful particles, making the ban a necessary public health measure.</p>

          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that offshore wind energy has no future in the U.S. under the Trump administration, calling it too expensive and unreliable. This is the clearest indication yet of the administration's intent to halt the industry, following an executive order on day one that barred new leases. Burgum confirmed that the Department of the Interior is closely reviewing five offshore wind farms already under construction, raising uncertainty for billions of dollars in existing investments. The administration has already ordered at least one project, Revolution Wind, to halt construction due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, this article explores the escalating cycle of political violence in the United States. It contrasts the reactions of those calling for de-escalation with those on social media declaring "war," arguing that such rhetoric fuels further violence. While acknowledging the danger, the author interviews a former Justice Department official who believes the vast majority of Americans do not want a civil war, preferring the stability of everyday life. The article concludes by urging leaders to unequivocally condemn political violence to prevent the nation from sliding further into a catastrophic cycle.</p>

          <p>Belarus has released 52 political prisoners, including journalists and activists, as part of a deal with the Trump administration to secure partial relief from U.S. sanctions. In exchange, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. The release was described by authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko as a humanitarian gesture, though over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated following a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2020. The deal represents a diplomatic negotiation aimed at improving relations and potentially reopening the U.S. embassy in Minsk.</p>

          <p>Several NATO countries, including the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and France, are deploying troops, air defense systems, and fighter jets to bolster the alliance's eastern flank. The move is a direct response to a Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, which Warsaw has labeled an unprecedented provocation intended to test NATO's capabilities. Poland has requested a UN Security Council meeting over the incident and is implementing new airspace restrictions along its eastern borders. The coordinated response demonstrates the alliance's effort to present a united front against what European leaders believe was a deliberate act of intimidation by Russia.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving forward with a controversial rule change designed to speed up the confirmation process for President Trump's non-cabinet level nominees. The change, which would allow nominees to be confirmed in groups, is a response to what Republicans call a Democratic blockade that has slowed the president's ability to staff his administration. Democrats have warned against this "nuclear" option, arguing it will weaken the Senate's deliberative role and could be regretted in the future. The move follows the breakdown of bipartisan talks and highlights the increasing partisan friction over Senate procedures and presidential appointments.</p>

          <p>A new government inflation report indicates that President Trump's tariffs are contributing to rising costs for consumers on a range of everyday items, including clothing, electronics, and groceries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data for August showed price increases in multiple tariff-sensitive categories, pushing overall inflation further from the Federal Reserve's 2% target. While the administration has insisted tariffs would not drive inflation, economists note the "middle-class squeeze" is now evident. This trend presents a challenge for the Fed, which must weigh the inflationary pressure against signs of a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Based on the latest inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would be a modest increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by about $54. While any increase is helpful, retirees remain concerned that rising costs for essentials, particularly Medicare premiums, could outpace the adjustment. The official COLA will be announced in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated by the Social Security Administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Medical care costs are rising faster than general inflation, with hospital services in particular seeing a significant jump. This trend is projected to cause the largest increase in healthcare spending for large employers in 15 years, with overall costs expected to rise by an average of 9% in 2026. A major driver of this increase is the high cost of prescription drugs, especially cancer treatments and popular weight-loss medications. While companies are hesitant to pass these costs on to employees, many are considering it as a last resort, signaling higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for workers next year.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has unequivocally stated that "there will be no Palestinian state," reaffirming his hardline stance on the issue. He made the remarks during a visit to a settlement in the occupied West Bank while formally approving the construction of thousands of new homes in the controversial E1 area. This project is widely condemned internationally as it would effectively divide the West Bank and isolate East Jerusalem, which Palestinians envision as their future capital. Netanyahu's declaration is a direct rejection of the two-state solution long supported by the international community.</p>
