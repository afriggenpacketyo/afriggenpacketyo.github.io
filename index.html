          <p>A Harris's hawk, known for dive-bombing around 50 residents of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was captured last month after causing injuries, including one instance where a man was hospitalized. Falconer Wayne Housden has been training the bird and spent around £1,000 building an aviary to stabilize him. Housden plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to release him in the autumn, ensuring he won't be abandoned again.</p>

          <p>Glaciers worldwide are melting at twice the rate measured two decades ago, impacting communities and infrastructure globally. The collapse of the Birch Glacier in Switzerland recently underscored the effects of a warming world on ice-packed regions, causing a landslide that partially destroyed the village of Blatten. Two billion people rely on glacial melt for daily water needs, but as glaciers shrink, regions face water scarcity and increased risk of flooding. Melting ice sheets also contribute to rising sea levels, threatening low-lying islands and coastal cities.</p>

While the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, the agreement has yet to be implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's 10% blanket tariffs on other UK goods, creating uncertainty about the tariff deal's outcome.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as crucial "sinks" that sequester climate-warming greenhouse gases. These tidal habitats lock away carbon in layers of mud, making them unsung heroes in the fight against climate change. WWF is advocating for the inclusion of saltmarshes in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals to incentivize their restoration and protection. The UK has lost approximately 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, with many drained for agriculture.</p>

Despite growing public support, passage of the opposition-backed bills is unlikely during the current Diet session due to reluctance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. A revision to the Civil Code is required to enable couples to maintain different family names after marriage, a practice largely abandoned by women.
