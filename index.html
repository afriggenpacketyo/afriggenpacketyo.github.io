          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a decree to initiate Ukraine's withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use and production of anti-personnel landmines. This move, which requires parliamentary ratification, follows similar actions by Poland and Baltic states and comes as Kyiv seeks to counter Russia's intensifying offensive. In separate developments, the heads of the Russian SVR and American CIA held a phone call to discuss issues of mutual interest. The Ukrainian military also reported the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, who was killed while repelling a large-scale Russian aerial attack after successfully downing seven targets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. version of the reality show "Love Island" is experiencing its most-watched season, but its success is overshadowed by intense cyberbullying directed at contestants. This mirrors the tragic history of the original UK franchise, where multiple former contestants died by suicide, prompting a government inquiry into the welfare of reality TV stars. While producers for the American show state they have implemented robust mental health support, including on-site psychologists, some experts argue these measures still fall short of UK standards. The article highlights the conflict between producing entertaining television, which often relies on emotional conflict, and the ethical duty to protect participants facing the pressures of overnight fame.</p>

          <p>An early morning explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood resulted in the collapse of three rowhomes, killing one person and hospitalizing two elderly women. The blast, which occurred before 5 a.m., scattered debris across the area, damaging adjacent buildings and vehicles, and prompted the evacuation of nearby residents as a precaution. A search and rescue dog located the deceased victim in the rubble, and officials believe all individuals are now accounted for. The cause of the explosion is under a slow, methodical investigation by multiple agencies, including the Philadelphia Fire Department and the ATF, to prevent any secondary collapses.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary highlights a significant shift in the party's politics, particularly concerning Israel. As an outspoken critic of Israel who supports the BDS movement and has declined to condemn the term "global intifada," his success has alarmed some in the city's large Jewish community, who fear it signals waning influence and rising antisemitism. However, Mamdani's win, supported by many Jewish voters, also reflects a growing disillusionment among progressive Democrats with Israel's actions in Gaza. The election result suggests that a critical stance on Israel is no longer a disqualifying factor in Democratic primaries, prioritizing other issues like affordability for many voters.</p>

          <p>An intense and early summer heatwave is affecting large parts of Europe, with temperatures soaring past 40Â°C (104Â°F) and breaking records. Spain recorded its hottest June day ever at 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy placed 21 cities on high alert, and authorities in Greece issued warnings about wildfire risks. The extreme heat is expected to persist, with London anticipating its hottest day of the year. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to human-driven climate change, noting a sharp rise in their occurrence since the year 2000, which also poses a significant threat to local biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is elected mayor of New York City, he must "do the right thing" or risk losing federal funding for the city. In a Fox News interview, Trump extended this threat to any future NYC mayor, warning that the federal government would come down "very tough on them financially" if they do not behave. This is not the first time Trump has threatened to withhold federal funds from political opponents. Mamdani, a democratic socialist whom Trump has repeatedly labeled a communist, has rejected the label and stated he is accustomed to the former president's personal attacks.</p>

          <p>Animal welfare experts are issuing urgent warnings to dog owners about the dangers of exercising their pets in hot weather, as dogs are highly susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Unlike humans, dogs have a limited ability to cool down and can quickly overheat, with signs including heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. The article advises against walking dogs in high temperatures, suggesting instead indoor play and walks during the coolest parts of the day, such as early morning or late evening. It also provides a simple test: if the pavement is too hot to comfortably hold the back of your hand on it, it is too hot for a dog's paws.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has warned that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment program in "a matter of months" following recent U.S. military strikes on its nuclear facilities. While the Trump administration claimed the sites were "totally obliterated," Grossi believes the damage was severe but not total, and that Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to proceed. He also noted the possibility that Iran may have moved its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to a secret location before the attack. Grossi emphasized the importance of resuming dialogue and allowing international inspectors back into the country to ensure peaceful nuclear activities.</p>

Despite its strong opening and positive reviews, the movie's high production budget of over $200 million means it still has a long road to profitability.

          <p>As the United Nations faces a budget crisis and Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres directs staff to slash spending, a report reveals that high-level officials continue to receive extensive and costly perks. These benefits, which are not being cut in the proposed 2026 budget, include tax-free salaries with location-based multipliers, generous housing and education allowances, and substantial pension contributions. For example, the Secretary-General's salary is higher than the U.S. President's, supplemented by a Manhattan residence and chauffeur. Critics argue these perks are excessive, especially as the U.S., the UN's largest funder, is pushing for fiscal responsibility and the organization claims to be tightening its belt.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma has stated that he believes children born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents should be deported along with them. His comments came in response to a recent Supreme Court decision that allows former President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship to take effect in some states. When asked what should happen to these U.S.-citizen children, Mullin argued against separating families, stating, "they should go where their parents are." The remarks add to the ongoing and contentious debate over the 14th Amendment and the future of birthright citizenship in the United States.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. China controls over 90% of the global refining capacity and has shown its willingness to weaponize this dominance by restricting exports. Despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to create a secure, independent supply chain, leaving its commercial and defense sectors exposed. The author contends that short-term diplomatic agreements are insufficient and calls for a coherent, long-term national strategy that includes domestic investment, permitting reform, and robust partnerships with allied nations to counter China's geopolitical leverage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to roll back federal energy and water efficiency regulations for home appliances, including potentially eliminating the popular Energy Star program. Following an executive order from the former president, the Department of Energy and the EPA are reviewing or planning to rescind dozens of rules that mandate standards for products like dishwashers, washing machines, and light bulbs. While the administration claims these regulations increase costs and lower quality, consumer groups and some manufacturers argue they save households money on utility bills and provide crucial comparison information. The move is expected to face significant legal challenges, particularly due to an anti-backsliding provision in the governing law.</p>

In response to an online post about the show, Bukele wrote, "Weâ€™re ready to ship them all to Paris whenever we get the green light." His government's crackdown has been praised for reducing homicides but criticized by human rights groups for poor conditions and lack of due process.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely watching key labor market data and trade policy developments in the upcoming holiday-shortened week. The focus will be on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and the official nonfarm payrolls report, which will provide insights into the health of the U.S. economy and potential Federal Reserve actions. A softening but not collapsing labor market has been indicated by rising continuing unemployment claims. Additionally, any updates from the White House on trade negotiations with China and other countries will be scrutinized, as tariff deadlines approach and could influence market sentiment and economic stability.

          <h2>UK Labour Government in 'Better Position' on Welfare Reform After Major U-Turn</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 10:18:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that the changes, which include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only, have put them in a better position to pass the legislation. The U-turn was forced by widespread concern that the original plans to save Â£5bn annually would harm vulnerable and disabled people. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now likely support the bill, averting a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Nearly One in Five Cancer Drugs in Four African Nations are Defective</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 10:18:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has revealed that a significant number of cancer drugs being administered in four African nations are substandard, containing incorrect levels of active ingredients. Researchers who tested nearly 200 products from hospitals and pharmacies in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon found that approximately 17% were defective. Such drugs can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for patients. The problem is attributed to a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products circulating in a market with weak regulatory oversight. Experts say the findings highlight an urgent need for improved regulation, better screening technologies, and more secure supply chains across the continent.</p>
