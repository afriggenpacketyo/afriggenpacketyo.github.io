          <p>A proposed U.S. tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is causing concern on Wall Street due to its potential to weaponize the American tax system. The bill includes Section 899, which introduces significant changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S. Investment banks and law firms warn that this could escalate trade wars into capital wars, as the legislation allows the U.S. administration to use taxation on foreign holdings of U.S. assets to achieve economic goals. Section 899 targets entities from "discriminatory foreign countries" that impose levies affecting U.S. companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has criticized federal judges who blocked President Trump's ability to impose global tariffs, calling it "judicial overreach." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt urged the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the judges are undermining the credibility of the United States. The Court of International Trade deemed Trump's tariffs as "contrary to law," leading to a legal battle over the president's authority. The White House maintains that Trump's trade policy will continue despite the court orders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City’s police commissioner on during the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and later pleaded guilty to tax fraud before being pardoned, has died. He was 69. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Kash Patel said that Kerik’s death Thursday came after an unspecified “private battle with illness”. He served nearly four years in prison after pleading guilty in 2009 to tax fraud, making false statements and other charges. The charges stemmed partially from apartment renovations he received from a construction firm that authorities say wanted Kerik to convince New York officials it had no links to organized crime.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the remains of a nearly 3,000-year-old Mayan city in northern Guatemala, featuring pyramids and monuments.
