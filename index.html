          <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem experienced aircraft trouble returning from Guatemala and secured a ride back to the U.S. on an ICE deportation flight. The flight was returning to Louisiana after deporting individuals with criminal convictions, including for drug trafficking and assault. Noem used the opportunity to promote the administration's self-deportation app and highlighted recent agreements with Honduras and Guatemala to accept asylum seekers and share biometric data to combat illegal migration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of Maryland parents seeking to opt their elementary school children out of lessons involving books with LGBTQ themes. The majority opinion stated that the school district's policy, which had removed the opt-out option, placed an unconstitutional burden on the parents' religious freedom. The dissenting justices warned the decision could lead to "chaos" for public schools, while advocates for LGBTQ+ rights criticized the ruling for potentially alienating students.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that while recent Israeli and U.S. strikes severely damaged several Iranian nuclear facilities, the "worst nuclear safety scenario was avoided" with no significant off-site radiation detected.

However, some members of Congress expressed concern after a classified briefing that Iran's enriched uranium stockpile may have survived, leaving its breakout time for a nuclear weapon potentially very short.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated a 6-3 Supreme Court ruling that limits the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, calling it a "monumental victory for the Constitution." The decision stemmed from legal challenges to his executive order on birthright citizenship, and Trump said the administration can now move forward with policies that were previously blocked. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that "no right is safe" under the new legal regime created by the court, which weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

Newsom's legal team stated the lawsuit would be dropped if Fox News retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology. Fox News responded by calling the lawsuit a "frivolous publicity stunt" designed to chill free speech and vowed to defend the case vigorously.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet led to a significant increase in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to "front-load" inventory before tariffs took effect. Businesses have also been absorbing some costs and utilizing trade loopholes to delay duty payments amid uncertainty over trade policy. However, experts warn that these are temporary buffers and that price increases are still likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis argues the Supreme Court's decision allowing parents to opt children out of lessons with LGBTQ-themed books imposes a heavy burden on public schools. The 6-3 ruling requires schools to provide advance notice and opt-outs for such material, which critics say is administratively challenging and will likely lead schools to avoid queer-themed content altogether to prevent lawsuits. The author contends that while the opinion focuses on "celebrating" LGBTQ culture, the vague standard creates a chilling effect, potentially establishing a nationwide "Don't Say Gay" policy.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with debt, forgiveness through negotiation can be a viable option, though its success varies by debt type. Unsecured debts like credit card balances and personal loans are often the most negotiable, as creditors prefer recovering a partial amount to risking a total loss. Medical bills can also be reduced through hospital assistance programs or lump-sum settlement negotiations. However, other debts like buy now, pay later plans and payday loans are generally more difficult to settle due to their structure and lender practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, after qualifying for the Wimbledon main draw, has called for a change to NCAA rules that restrict his ability to claim his full prize money. As a student-athlete at the University of San Diego, Tarvet is limited to claiming $10,000 in profit per year plus expenses, despite earning Â£66,000 for reaching the first round. Tarvet stated that he believes he has earned and deserves the money from his performance. The issue is part of a larger debate, with other college players having launched legal action against the NCAA.</p>

          <p>A review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a purposeful regression to the electronic sound and youthful confusion of her earlier work. The album is set amid downtown Manhattan and explores themes of a transitional womanhood, including breakups, body image, and identity. While the production is praised for its fun beats and the album contains moments of magic, the reviewer finds the overall thrill is muted. The critic argues that the album's intense self-obsession, a trait that once defined her appeal, now feels redundant and insular.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is a "tragic" and "stunning" blow to the rule of law. The author contends that by restricting a federal court's relief to only the plaintiffs in a specific lawsuit, the court has made it far more difficult to halt unconstitutional actions by the executive branch. This could require separate lawsuits in all 94 federal districts to challenge a single policy, allowing an unconstitutional act to remain in effect. The author calls it an "existential threat" when judicial checks are crucial.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that the xenophobic and anti-Muslim attacks on NYC mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani from some Republican figures contradict the party's recent electoral gains. While Trump's 2024 victory was aided by increased support from minority voters, including Muslims, the rhetoric following Mamdani's primary win appears aimed at alienating this new coalition. The author notes that rather than catering to this expanded base, the MAGA movement and Trump's second-term agenda seem determined to pursue policies and rhetoric that are often diametrically opposed to these voters' interests.</p>

The decision leaves the current map, which was used in the 2024 elections and resulted in the election of two Black Democrats, in place for now. The case stems from a yearslong legal battle over whether the state's maps unconstitutionally dilute Black voting power or, conversely, rely too heavily on race in their construction.
