          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old man with "nihilistic ideations," as the suspect in the fatal car explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. Bartkus, who is believed to have died in the blast, reportedly left behind writings indicating his disapproval of people being brought into the world against their will, and he attempted to livestream the attack. Four other people were injured in the explosion, but none were staff or patients at the clinic.

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' estimates, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the Chinese economy.

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to fall in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. This would result in a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit costing £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. The article underscores a positive development for consumers facing high energy costs.</p>

Chan suggests that the U.S. needs to invest in research, innovation, and global economic ties to avoid becoming a diminished nation dominated by China, otherwise the U.S. may end up as a profoundly diminished nation.</p>
