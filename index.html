          <p>Google is requiring some remote employees to return to the office three days a week or risk job loss, signaling a shift away from pandemic-era flexibility. This decision impacts employees who were previously approved for remote work and comes as Google aims to cut costs and invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Sergey Brin emphasized the need for in-person collaboration, particularly for AI-related projects, advocating for a 60-hour work week in the office. Google's spokesperson stated that these decisions are team-based, underscoring the importance of in-person collaboration for innovation and problem-solving.</p>

The company has lowered its full-year same-store sales growth outlook and anticipates traffic to remain stagnant until the second half of the year.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent tour of Southeast Asia indicates a strategy to manage, rather than escalate, tensions in the South China Sea. Joint statements with Vietnam and Malaysia emphasize peaceful dispute resolution and adherence to international law.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs, including those imposed on auto parts from China and levies on steel and aluminum. This potential exemption follows lobbying from automakers and auto policy groups seeking relief from the increasing tariff burden on the automotive industry. The move would be separate from the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts scheduled to take effect by May 3. Shares of automakers and suppliers showed marginal gains in after-hours trading following the news.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's plan to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia involves selling out Ukraine to Vladimir Putin, according to reports. The proposal includes lifting sanctions against Russia, accepting a cease-fire that leaves Russian troops on Ukrainian territory, and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia. In return, Ukraine would receive a security guarantee from the U.S. The plan has been criticized as an instrument of surrender that would leave Ukraine vulnerable and cede control over its foreign policy.</p>
