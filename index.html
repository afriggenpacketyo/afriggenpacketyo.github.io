            <p>Two Pentagon officials were fired amid an investigation into unauthorized disclosures, ordered by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper. Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick were terminated after being placed on administrative leave, while a third official, Colin Carroll, was also put on leave. The officials expressed disappointment and claimed they were not informed of the specifics of the investigation. The probe, which may involve polygraph tests, follows a denial of Elon Musk's involvement in a classified briefing.</p>
