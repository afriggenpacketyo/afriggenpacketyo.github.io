          <p>A significant UK Ministry of Defence data breach in February 2022 accidentally exposed a spreadsheet with personal information of nearly 19,000 Afghans seeking relocation. The leak, which became public after a court lifted a super-injunction, led to a covert £850 million operation to relocate those affected, though many questions remain about the timeline and potential harm caused. The government has since brought approximately 4,500 people to the UK under a new, secret route created in response to the breach. The full extent of the damage and whether anyone was harmed as a direct result is still unknown.</p>

          <p>Shares of online firearms retailer GrabAGun, which counts Donald Trump Jr. as a board member and shareholder, fell over 20% during their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The public listing followed a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and Trump Jr. celebrated the event by ringing the opening bell. The company, now trading under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million from the merger, marking another instance of Trump family allies backing companies tied to conservative causes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University has officially adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism into its anti-discrimination policies. This move is part of an effort to secure an agreement with the Trump administration to restore $400 million in federal grants that were frozen over allegations the university failed to protect Jewish students. Critics argue the IHRA definition is controversial because it can be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israeli government policies by conflating it with antisemitism. The decision follows similar actions by other universities and is seen by some as a capitulation to political pressure that could impact academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has suspended four Members of Parliament for breaching party discipline by voting against the government's proposed welfare cuts. The MPs were among a group of 47 Labour rebels whose opposition forced the government to moderate its plans, a move that challenged the authority of party leader Sir Keir Starmer. The suspended MPs, including Rachael Maskell, have defended their actions, stating they were representing their constituents' interests and could not support policies that would impoverish disabled people. Despite the suspension, they have affirmed their commitment to Labour values and their roles as local representatives.</p>

          <p>A recent uptick in the Consumer Price Index, which rose 2.7% annually in June, signals that inflationary pressures may persist, potentially keeping borrowing costs high for consumers. Since most credit card annual percentage rates (APRs) are variable and linked to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, continued inflation makes it likely the Fed will maintain its current high interest rates. This environment means credit card rates, already averaging over 21%, could remain elevated or even increase, making it more difficult for individuals to pay down debt. The article outlines strategies for consumers to manage high-interest debt, such as balance transfers and personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced the Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act to impose restrictions and require transparency for donations to presidential libraries. The move follows several large corporate contributions to President Trump's future library, including multi-million dollar settlements from Paramount Global and Walt Disney Co., and a gifted luxury jet from Qatar. The proposed bill aims to close loopholes that could allow such donations to be used for bribery or to curry favor with a sitting president. It would cap contributions, ban donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and delay fundraising until after a president leaves office.</p>

          <p>Germany's system of staggering summer school vacations across its 16 federal states, designed to prevent massive traffic jams and overcrowding, is a source of annual political friction. While the system benefits the tourism industry, states regularly argue over who gets the most desirable later summer slots, which often have better weather and cheaper travel options. The southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg have consistently refused to rotate their late vacation schedules, drawing criticism from other states that wish to have a later start.

          <p>A CBS "48 Hours" correspondent is revisiting the highly unusual case of Linda Duffey, who was accused of murdering her husband, Patrick, in 2007. Duffey admitted to shooting her husband but claimed it was a bizarre accident that occurred while she was mimicking a Bugs Bunny cartoon featuring Elmer Fudd. This so-called "Bugs Bunny defense" was reportedly so strange that it divided opinions among law enforcement officials even before it reached a courtroom. The case, with its unpredictable twists and the unique nature of the defense, offers a compelling look into the workings of the justice system when faced with an extraordinary claim.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of men convicted of violent crimes, including murder and child sexual assault, to the African nation of Eswatini. The deportees, originally from countries like Cuba, Jamaica, and Vietnam, were sent to Eswatini because their home countries refused to accept them. This action is part of an aggressive administration strategy to persuade third countries to take in deportees who are not their own citizens, a controversial practice that has drawn criticism from human rights advocates. The government of Eswatini confirmed the men were transferred to correctional facilities and said it would work to return them to their countries of origin.</p>

          <p>Syria's government is facing escalating instability as it attempts to manage deadly sectarian clashes in the south and responds to Israeli airstrikes. Recent violence between Druze and Sunni militias near Sweida has resulted in over 300 deaths, prompting a government ceasefire. Concurrently, Israel conducted strikes on Syrian army headquarters, stating it was acting to protect the local Druze population from harm by government-aligned forces. These events highlight the complex and fragile security situation under President Ahmed al-Sharaa's new government, which is under pressure to protect minorities and control violent actors amid ongoing conflicts and a lack of resources.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has vacated a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of approximately 15 million Americans. The judge ruled that the CFPB exceeded its statutory authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule, which had been praised by consumer advocates, aimed to prevent medical debt from negatively impacting consumers' credit scores, as it is often considered a poor predictor of creditworthiness. The decision is a setback for efforts to shield consumers from the financial repercussions of complex and often disputed medical billing issues.</p>
