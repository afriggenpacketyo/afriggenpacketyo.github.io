          <p>President Trump stated he has no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite previous criticisms. Trump nominated Powell in 2017, and Biden renominated him in 2021. Trump also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, but wants Powell to be more active in cutting interest rates. Financial markets responded positively to Trump's remarks, with major stock markets showing gains; however, the IMF downgraded the U.S. economic growth forecast due to tariff uncertainty.

          <p>Six major automotive industry groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider proposed 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already facing financial distress. They represent a sector that supports 10 million American jobs and contributes $1.2 trillion to the economy annually. President Trump has hinted at potentially helping auto companies needing time to adjust to domestic parts production.</p>

Experts suggest these comments reveal the U.S.'s eagerness to reach a deal, potentially allowing China to secure more favorable terms.

          <p>With the Real ID deadline weeks away, many states are not fully compliant, potentially causing disruptions at airports and federal buildings. A recent analysis indicates that numerous states have compliance rates below 70%, meaning millions of travelers may face difficulties. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to enhance the security of state-issued identification. Travelers without a Real ID will be subject to additional screening, potentially causing delays.

          <h2>Trump Hints at Easing China Tariffs; Musk to Reduce Doge Involvement</h2>

          <p>President Trump has indicated a potential reduction in tariffs on goods from China, although they "won't be zero," after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a de-escalation in the trade war. This follows Trump's earlier imposition of high tariffs on China, which led to retaliatory measures. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to step back from his role at the "department of government efficiency" (Doge) from May, as the company reported a significant decline in profits amid criticism of his White House involvement.

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is confronting a difficult outlook due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support. The sector is also struggling with a price war resulting from overproduction. With exports to the U.S. likely to be affected by higher tariffs, producers are projected to cut capital expenditure, potentially slowing the expansion of battery energy-storage systems. The relentless price war has already caused a significant drop in average export prices.</p>
