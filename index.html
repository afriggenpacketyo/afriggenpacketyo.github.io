          <p>A 25-year-old California man, Jordan Murray, has been charged with the murder of a 40-year-old man after being released from jail on "mental health diversion" just six months prior. Murray had allegedly committed two violent robberies in May and June 2024, but was released in November 2024 after courts granted him mental health diversion. The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office expressed outrage that this preventable murder occurred so soon after his release. Murray is now being held without bail and faces charges for murder and felony robbery, in addition to the previous robbery charges.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department advocated for Chancellor Rachel Reeves to raise taxes before this year's Spring Statement. The memo proposed measures to increase taxes by £3-4 billion annually, including raising corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While Reeves did not implement these proposals, the memo reflects ongoing internal disagreements within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. Some Labour MPs have voiced concerns about welfare cuts and are pushing for alternative revenue-raising measures, such as a wealth tax.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, stated that U.S. export controls on advanced A.I. chips to China have been a failure, spurring Chinese companies to accelerate their own development in the field.

Huang explained that the export controls provided Chinese companies with the motivation, energy, and government support to advance their technology. Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains committed to selling A.I. chips in China, but faces increasing competition from local alternatives.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff, has sparked concerns among Maga Catholics, who fear a clash between their nationalist ideology and the Pope's universalist views. Influencers like Laura Loomer have criticized Leo XIV as "anti-Trump" and "pro-open Borders," reflecting a broader apprehension within the Maga right. The new Pope's choice of name signals a recognition of the challenge posed by right-wing populism, reminiscent of Leo XIII's confrontation with the social injustices of the Industrial Revolution. Leo XIV's commitment to addressing global crises like climate change and inequality suggests a potential critique of the Maga worldview.</p>

The supplementary budget bill, allocating 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) for the initiative, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike emphasized the need to protect residents' lives and daily living due to declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer.

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House to address strained relations between the two countries. The U.S. administration has criticized Pretoria for alleged persecution of white Afrikaner farmers, cut aid, and snubbed G20 events hosted by South Africa. Ramaphosa aims to correct Trump's misconceptions about race relations and government policies in South Africa, while also safeguarding a vital free trade agreement.

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses operating in China report increasing difficulties due to regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. The British Chamber of Commerce in China calls for a more favorable policy environment with clear and consistently enforced rules. Despite these challenges, British firms remain committed to the Chinese market, though confidence in China's long-term outlook has declined. Escalating tensions between China and the US have placed many British firms in a precarious position, leading to investment delays both in China and globally.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning of a potential 1,000-foot-tall "mega tsunami" that could devastate America's West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii if a major earthquake strikes the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. Such an event could sink coastal land by as much as 6.5 feet and trigger massive waves, potentially wiping out cities like Seattle and Portland.
