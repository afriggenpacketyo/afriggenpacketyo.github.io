          <h2>US Housing Market Sees Record High Prices Despite Slumping Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradoxical situation where home prices reached an all-time high in June, even as sales volumes fell to a nine-month low. This trend is largely driven by affluent, all-cash buyers and a persistent lack of inventory, as many current homeowners are hesitant to sell and give up their low-interest mortgages. While the high-end market is thriving, affordability remains a significant barrier for first-time and middle-income buyers who are squeezed by both high prices and elevated mortgage rates. This dynamic creates a split market of 'haves' and 'have-nots,' with some regional markets even seeing price declines. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have declared that disarmament is a "red line," signaling rising fears of sectarian violence. This declaration comes as a peace agreement with Syria's interim government stalls over critical issues, including the integration of Kurdish fighters into the national army and control over oil-rich regions. The situation is further complicated by Turkey, which opposes Kurdish autonomy and has reportedly been asked by Damascus to help bolster Syrian defense capabilities. This complex geopolitical landscape places Syria's Kurdish minority at a critical and potentially perilous juncture.</p>

          <h2>Newcastle United Manager Addresses Liverpool's Interest in Striker Alexander Isak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 04:29:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has commented on the future of star striker Alexander Isak, who is reportedly a transfer target for Liverpool. While Howe emphasized that Isak has been "magnificent" for the club and is a popular figure in the dressing room, he acknowledged that any potential move must ultimately be what is right for Newcastle. Isak, who did not travel with the team for a pre-season tour due to a thigh injury, has a contract until 2028. Howe expressed his hope and confidence that the Swedish international will remain with the team for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the nation's foremost independent rights group, has reported facing an unprecedented crackdown from state authorities. The organization claims its work is being impeded by actions such as the sealing of its office, freezing of bank accounts, and obstruction of public events. While the Pakistani government denies these allegations, citing security concerns as the reason for any restrictions, the HRCP and other activists view these moves as part of a broader, alarming trend of shrinking space for civil liberties and dissent in the country.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for the establishment of an international center to coordinate global cooperation and standards for artificial intelligence. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference, Li highlighted the current "fragmented trend" in AI governance and urged the creation of a widely accepted global framework. This proposal is viewed as a strategic move by China to increase its influence in the rapidly advancing tech sector. The call comes shortly after the United States unveiled its own policy blueprint aimed at reinforcing American dominance in the ongoing technological rivalry.</p>

          <p>The UK government has strongly condemned the Hong Kong authorities for issuing cash bounties for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists living in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries described the move as another clear example of "transnational repression." The bounties target 19 individuals living abroad who are accused of violating Beijing's national security law. The UK government reaffirmed its commitment to protecting the rights and safety of all individuals in the UK, including those who have relocated from Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines passenger flight made a sudden, dramatic plunge of 300 feet in 36 seconds shortly after taking off from Burbank, California, to avoid another aircraft. The aggressive maneuver, prompted by an alert about a nearby Hawker Hunter fighter jet, caused some unbelted passengers to be thrown from their seats and resulted in injuries to two cabin crew members. The flight was able to continue safely to its destination in Las Vegas. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the serious incident amid growing concerns over aviation safety.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been questioned by the U.S. Justice Department. While details of the one-and-a-half-day interview were not disclosed, her lawyer stated she answered questions honestly about numerous individuals. The article also notes that President Donald Trump has denied being briefed that his name appeared in Epstein's files, despite reports to the contrary. This development marks a continued effort by authorities to investigate the broader network surrounding the deceased sex offender.</p>
