          <p>Emil Bove, a judicial nominee and former attorney for President Trump, has generated controversy with his responses to a Senate questionnaire. He declined to denounce the January 6 Capitol attack, labeling it a matter of political debate, and avoided confirming the constitutionality of presidential term limits. Bove also defended his role in the dismissal of a corruption case against New York's mayor and stated he could not recall details about his supervision of January 6 prosecutions. His evasive answers have drawn sharp criticism from Democrats who question his impartiality and fitness for a lifetime judicial appointment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Georgia resident Edwin Brant Frost IV of operating a Ponzi scheme through his company, First Liberty Building & Loan. The SEC alleges that Frost raised at least $140 million from around 300 investors by promising high returns, but instead used new investor funds to pay earlier ones. A significant portion of the money was allegedly used for personal expenses, including political donations and luxury items. In a statement provided by his lawyer, Frost has taken full responsibility for his actions, apologized to those he harmed, and pledged to cooperate with authorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump and the first lady visited Kerrville, Texas, to survey the devastation from recent catastrophic flooding and meet with affected families and first responders. The president expressed the "anguish of our entire nation" for the victims of the disaster, which has claimed at least 121 lives with over 170 people still missing. During a roundtable with officials, Mr. Trump acknowledged the immense loss of life, particularly among children from a local summer camp. He has signed a federal disaster declaration for the region, enabling FEMA to support the ongoing local rescue and recovery operations.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant surge in institutional investment through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, which propelled the cryptocurrency's price upward. The rally was also supported by a wave of short liquidations, where traders betting against bitcoin were forced to buy back, further increasing its price. Analysts suggest that expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and potential fiscal policies are contributing to the positive sentiment in the crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has canceled the plea agreements for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other men accused of planning the September 11th attacks. The deals would have allowed the defendants to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, avoiding the death penalty. The court ruled 2-to-1 that former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had the legal authority to rescind the agreements, which he did shortly after they were announced, stating he was not consulted. This decision overturns lower court rulings and ensures the long-stalled military tribunal case at Guantánamo Bay will not reach a swift conclusion, frustrating some victims' families who sought closure.</p>

          <p>The legal team for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongfully deported and then returned to the U.S., has asked a federal judge to require 72 hours' notice before any future deportation. Abrego Garcia was deported to a Salvadoran mega-prison despite a court order barring his removal, based on administration claims that he was an MS-13 gang member, which he denies. Now back in the U.S. facing separate charges, his lawyers fear he could be deported again if released on bond. The judge heavily criticized the government for its handling of the case and its lack of a clear plan to ensure his due process rights are protected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the deficit in May, largely driven by a surge in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall increase in government receipts. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit stands at $1.34 trillion, with net interest on the national debt remaining a major expense. The figures highlight the financial impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies on government revenue, even as overall federal debt continues to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A disturbing pattern of abductions targeting women from Syria's Alawite minority has been reported, with dozens believed to have been kidnapped. One victim, Nora, recounted being held captive for a month, where she was brutalized and her family was blackmailed for ransom. The attacks are believed to be linked to the Alawite community's connection to the ousted Assad regime, with some extremists viewing them as apostates. The UN has documented several cases, and human rights activists are tracking around 40 missing women, noting that the kidnappings appear to be a systematic effort to subjugate the community.</p>

          <p>This article argues that recent actions by FBI Director Kash Patel and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard represent a dangerous politicization of America's security agencies. Patel is reportedly using polygraph tests to identify senior FBI employees who have spoken negatively about him personally. Simultaneously, Gabbard is said to be using AI to scan internal communications across spy agencies to find individuals perceived as undermining the administration's agenda. The author contends that these internal loyalty hunts are a distraction from genuine threats like foreign espionage and terrorism, creating a climate of fear and corroding morale within these vital institutions.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting the agency to ask some laid-off staff to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic hurdles implemented by the Trump administration, including a grant review process managed by the controversial DOGE initiative. The stalled funding affects numerous programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and HIV care resources. With the end of the fiscal year approaching, HHS is reportedly considering shrinking application periods and using contractors to clear the backlog, which critics say could compromise the review process.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the current season of the reality show 'Love Island USA' serves as an insightful look into the dating habits of Generation Z. Despite its popularity, the season has been criticized for a lack of genuine romantic connections, with contestants often appearing emotionally guarded and hesitant to form deep bonds. The author argues this reflects a broader trend among Gen Z, a cohort with less relationship experience that often favors non-committal "situationships" and fears appearing overly eager. The show's most popular contestants are those who defy this trend by openly expressing their strong emotions, suggesting viewers crave authentic vulnerability.</p>
