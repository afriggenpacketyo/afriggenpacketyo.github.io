          <p>This article details the timeline of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation to El Salvador by the Trump administration in March 2025, despite a 2019 court order protecting him from deportation to that country. The article recounts the Trump administration's claim that Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, which his family denies. Following court battles, including Supreme Court involvement, Abrego Garcia was eventually indicted for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants and brought back to the U.S. to face charges, highlighting the legal and political complexities of the case. The article includes key dates and events, from his initial deportation to his return to the U.S. to face charges.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Turley discusses the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, not for a removal hearing as initially hoped by Democrats, but to face trial on human trafficking charges. The article highlights that Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, now faces a lengthy prison sentence followed by deportation. Turley points out that Abrego Garcia's past conduct, including allegations of gang involvement and human trafficking, came under scrutiny after his deportation challenge. The article suggests that Abrego Garcia's challenge drew unwanted attention to his prior activities, leading to his indictment and a less favorable outcome than he anticipated.</p>

The program requires recipients to work and provides regular financial check-ins, and it also allows them to save money by keeping monthly payments flat as their income increases. The article contrasts this program with others that have not been as successful, such as one in Washington state, and it highlights the importance of additional support services.

          <p>This article discusses how China’s Gen Z is rewriting the liquor industry as their tastes change and consumption of traditional baijiu dips. Farmers in Baisha, known for its liquor production, are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain, as green plums are used to produce lighter, fruitier wines. More Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products, focusing on low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages to appeal to younger demographics. The article notes that the younger generation is prioritizing self-indulgent experiences and emotional companionship over traditional social rituals involving alcohol.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece explores the motivations behind Elon Musk's shift in political alignment. The author initially believed Musk's move to the right was driven by cultural issues and his desire to advance space exploration. However, the article notes that Musk's role in a second Trump administration has not aligned with these expectations. The piece suggests that Musk's true motivations remain a mystery, as his actions have not consistently supported either anti-woke initiatives or deregulatory efforts. </p>

          <p>This New York Times editorial asserts that former President Trump presides over a culture of corruption, alleging that he and his family benefit financially from government policy changes. The article cites the cryptocurrency industry as a prime example, claiming Trump has made about $1 billion in cryptocurrency in the past nine months and has shut down a Justice Department team that investigated illegal uses of cryptocurrency. The editorial argues that Trump's actions weaken public faith in government and degrade the reputation of the United States. The editorial claims that Trump is proud of his avarice, wearing it as a sign of success and savvy.</p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's plan to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on the Army's birthday, which also happens to be his own. While acknowledging criticism that the parade could be seen as self-aggrandizing or intimidating, the author argues that it could also be a patriotic celebration and a way to counter misperceptions about the armed forces. The article notes that the American military is shrinking due to recruitment challenges and that a parade could help reconnect veterans and familiarize civilians with their armed forces. The author notes the risk is that Trump will use the occasion not to celebrate the troops but to corrode their professionalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump’s investigation of Joe Biden’s cognitive decline could expand presidential immunity, enabling more lawlessness. The author suggests that the investigation, while seemingly targeting Biden's aides, could be used to set a precedent for shielding Trump's own aides from prosecution. The piece posits that the investigation of Biden may tempt courts to side with Biden's aides, shielding them from a frivolous investigation, and that temptation may be what Trump’s team is counting on: using a bogus investigation of Biden to set a precedent to shield their own subsequent criminal activity.</p>

          <p>This article details plans for the NHS app in England to become the default method of communication for millions more patients, saving the health service £200m over the next three years. The government says more test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders will be sent directly to smartphones, moving away from traditional letters. People without app access will receive texts and letters as a last resort, and the move is hoped to free up NHS phone lines. The changes aim to improve patient access to healthcare management and informed decision-making.</p>
