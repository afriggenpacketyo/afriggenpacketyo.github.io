          <p>As the US and Iran engage in nuclear talks, Iran's opposition remains cautiously optimistic, though divided on the best path to regime change. Some exiled activists believe neither a renewed nuclear agreement nor military action would benefit the Iranian people, while others support foreign intervention to overthrow the Islamic Republic. Historians warn against military invasion, advocating for internal change and diplomatic solutions that ease sanctions and promote economic openness. The article suggests that the influence of diaspora Iranians may wane as Washington shifts its policies towards Iran.</p>

          <p>Chinese government scientists have announced successful results from a weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4% across 8,000 sq km.

          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the initial vote was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The annulled November vote saw a far-right, pro-Russian candidate surprisingly win the first round, leading to investigations into campaign financing and organization. While several candidates are vying for the presidency, the main challengers are expected to be George Simion, Nicusor Dan, and Crin Antonescu, each representing different political ideologies and approaches to Romania's future. The election's outcome is significant for Romania's pro-Western orientation and its relationship with the EU and NATO.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding ultra-processed baby food pouches, arguing that it's another way of creating maternal guilt. The author, a parenting columnist, acknowledges dietary concerns but questions the moral judgment placed on mothers who use pouches for convenience. She argues that criticizing pouches ignores the broader social, political, and economic factors that influence food choices, such as time constraints and the pressure to engage in intensive mothering. The author calls for a society that supports parents with improved paternity leave, workplace creches, and accessible cooking workshops, rather than condemning them for using convenient food options.</p>

While the Labour party focuses on proving the effectiveness of government, the Conservative party is struggling to regain relevance and public trust. Farage's Reform UK has successfully tapped into public anger and frustration, potentially reshaping the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Sunday's newspaper headlines are dominated by the fallout from Prince Harry's BBC interview and Reform UK's ambitious plans if it wins a general election. The Duke of Sussex's remarks have reportedly strained relations with the royal family, while Reform UK is proposing radical policies, including declaring a national emergency on illegal migration and "remoralising" young people. Other headlines include VE Day commemorations, a biography of Paul O'Grady, and concerns about Labour's inheritance tax changes for farmers. The papers also discuss the Conservative party's internal struggles and Reform UK's growing influence.</p>

          <p>Australia's opposition Liberal party is reeling after a crushing defeat in the federal election, with leader Peter Dutton losing his seat. The Labor party's landslide victory has prompted calls for a serious review of the Liberal party's failures, particularly in major cities. The results reflect a rejection of division and a desire for unity, as stated by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The Liberal party now faces the challenge of finding a new leader and reassessing its strategies to regain relevance in Australian politics.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a school choice bill into law, allocating $1 billion for a voucher program that allows parents to use public funds for private school tuition. The program, capped at $1 billion for the first year and covering up to 90,000 students, aims to provide parents with more educational options. Supporters argue it will benefit students in underperforming public schools, while critics claim it will drain resources from public education and subsidize private education for wealthy families. Starting next school year, families can receive $10,000 per year, with children with disabilities qualifying for up to $30,000 per year.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift from a coalition government to a royal court, where loyalty trumps expertise. Unlike his first term, where Trump was often checked by advisors, his second term is characterized by yes-men and accelerationists, leading to a presidency marked by ferocity and recklessness. The decision to pick Vance, over more moderate options, revealed that Trump's second term would offer no concessions and contain no skeptics, fundamentally altering the structure of his administration.</p>
