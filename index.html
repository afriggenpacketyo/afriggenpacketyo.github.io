          <p>Shares of high-fructose corn syrup producers, including Archer-Daniels-Midland, experienced a significant drop after former President Trump claimed he secured a deal for Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, appreciating Trump's enthusiasm without confirming the switch, the announcement caused market volatility for ingredient suppliers. The Corn Refiners Association warned of potential job losses and negative impacts on American farmers if such a change were implemented, highlighting the economic stakes of the debate.

          <p>The Euro 2025 women's football tournament has highlighted a significant lack of ethnic diversity on many European national teams compared to their male counterparts. While the sport's fan culture is celebrated for its inclusivity, squads like England and Germany have far less representation from minority communities than their general populations. In contrast, the French team is noted for its diversity, which is attributed to a widespread, accessible club system, prompting discussions on how other nations can dismantle barriers to entry at the grassroots level.</p>

          <p>Financial experts anticipate that home equity loan rates are unlikely to decrease following the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting in July. Due to persistent inflation and a strong jobs report, the Fed is widely expected to maintain the current federal funds rate, which directly influences borrowing costs for products like home equity loans and HELOCs. While a rate cut is not completely ruled out for later in the year, borrowers hoping for immediate relief will likely need to wait for more significant shifts in economic data.

          <p>Consumer advocates are warning that the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system could leave many borrowers without affordable repayment options. The recently passed "big beautiful bill" phases out multiple income-driven repayment plans, including the defunct SAVE plan, and introduces a new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) with significantly higher monthly payments. With fewer, more expensive options, there is a growing risk that borrowers will struggle to keep up with their payments, potentially leading to a rise in defaults. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler stated that the central bank should hold off on cutting interest rates "for some time" as the economic effects of the Trump administration's tariffs begin to increase consumer prices.

She argued that maintaining a restrictive policy stance is crucial to keep long-term inflation expectations anchored while the job market remains stable. (not investment advice)</p>

Since Trump's second term began, his administration has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, granted clemency to several financial fraudsters, and seen a decline in federal white-collar prosecutions. Critics argue this approach creates a permissive environment for corporate malfeasance while the DOJ focuses on crimes that fit the administration's political narratives.</p>
