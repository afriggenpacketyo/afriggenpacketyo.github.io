        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With local elections in England on Thursday, Nigel Farage’s Reform U.K. party is poised to gain ground amidst widespread frustration with the Labour and Conservative parties. The article highlights that the economy's stagnation and the government's low approval ratings are creating opportunities for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Voters will elect over 1,600 council members across 24 municipalities and six regional mayors, while a special election will fill a vacant parliamentary seat. Reform U.K. hopes to secure hundreds of council seats and potentially win the special election, testing their ability to govern and impacting the standing of major political figures.</p>

          <p>Mercedes-Benz announced plans to add a new vehicle to its Alabama plant by 2027, as the company continues its strategy of producing vehicles where they are sold. While officials didn't specify the new model, the Alabama plant primarily manufactures SUVs and serves as a global export hub, with approximately 60% of its SUVs being exported. The announcement occurs amidst President Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles and additional levies on automotive parts. A Mercedes-Benz spokesperson declined to comment on whether the decision was directly related to the tariffs, instead citing a "local-for-local strategy".</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom recorded its hottest start to May ever, with temperatures reaching 28C (82.4F) in London, surpassing the previous record set in 1990. Much of the UK experienced heat well above the seasonal average, though Scotland and Northern Ireland remained cooler. The warm weather was caused by a blocked area of high pressure over the UK, leading to a sustained south-easterly air flow bringing warm conditions. This record-breaking temperature marks a notable departure from typical May weather patterns in the region.</p>

          <h2>Experts Doubt Trump's Tariffs Can Fund Tax Cuts for Most Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 08:59:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that revenue from his new tariffs could fund tax cuts for Americans earning under $200,000. However, tax experts argue that this is highly unlikely, stating that the tariffs won't generate enough revenue to offset the $2.4 trillion in income taxes paid by American households annually. The article explains that even aggressive tariffs would fall far short of replacing income tax revenue, and that tariffs disproportionately burden low- and middle-income households. Economists warn that relying on tariffs could slow economic growth and reignite inflation, effectively replacing one form of tax with another, with potentially negative distributional effects.

          <p>The Football Association (FA) in England announced that transgender women will be prohibited from playing on affiliated women's soccer teams starting in June.

          <p>Senator Tommy Tuberville and former coach Nick Saban will meet with President Trump to discuss NIL regulations in college sports, aiming to establish uniform rules across states and address the transfer portal.

The discussions will also cover women's sports and transgender inclusion, with Tuberville emphasizing the importance of protecting Title IX and women's athletics. He believes the current landscape of college sports risks losing fans due to a lack of player loyalty and potential financial losses for non-revenue sports.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) is grappling with a cyber attack that has disrupted online operations and affected food availability in stores. The attack, identified as ransomware, has led to the pausing of online orders for nearly a week and the removal of job adverts from the company's website. The company is working to resolve the issue. The disruption has also impacted suppliers and a small proportion of products supplied to Ocado, which delivers M&S online food orders. The retailer's share price has fallen, wiping more than half a billion pounds off the company's value.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter results, with revenue and earnings exceeding expectations due to high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to a recent cancer treatment deal. CEO Dave Ricks noted that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing U.S. manufacturing investments. The company's diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight loss drug Zepbound both exceeded sales estimates. Shares of Eli Lilly fell after CVS Health announced Wegovy as its preferred weight loss medication.</p>

This shift represents a move away from moral concerns, with Trump prioritizing U.S. self-interest.

It's also crucial to stop using the card and create a personal budget to track expenses and payment obligations. Credit counseling and debt consolidation loans can provide additional support, but commitment to repayment is essential. Prioritizing debt with the highest interest rates and late fees can help manage overwhelming balances. (not investment advice)</p>
