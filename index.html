          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and head coach Andy Reid were involved in a heated face-to-face confrontation on the sideline during their game against the New York Giants. The incident occurred after a drive stalled in the first half, and television cameras captured Reid bumping his shoulder into Kelce as he walked away. When asked about the exchange, Reid downplayed any conflict, telling a sideline reporter that the team needed "some juice" and that the emotion was good. This marks the second time the pair have had a public, passionate exchange during a game.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent observations of China's advanced GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" stealth drone reveal a significant design change: folding wings. This modification strongly suggests the uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) is being adapted for deployment on aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. The development aligns with imagery seen on the emblem for China's new Type 076 "drone carrier," which features an electromagnetic catapult. These clues indicate that the GJ-11 could become the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone, enhancing China's naval power projection capabilities in contested regions.</p>

          <p>Most stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Monday, following China's decision to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year rate at 3.5%, a move that was widely expected by economists. This decision to hold steady, despite a recent rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, provided a degree of stability for investors, contributing to positive trading in markets like Japan and South Korea, while Hong Kong's index saw a slight decline.

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk were seen shaking hands and conversing at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, signaling a potential reconciliation after a very public and bitter falling out. Musk, who once led a government efficiency initiative for Trump, had previously broken with the president over policy and engaged in a social media feud. Their meeting in Arizona, captured and shared by the White House, has fueled speculation about the billionaire's future role and influence within Trump's political circle. The reunion took place amidst a large gathering paying tribute to Kirk.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has destroyed a speedboat in the Caribbean that was allegedly transporting 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, according to authorities in the Dominican Republic. In a joint operation, officials from the Dominican Republic recovered 377 packages of the drug from the vessel's wreckage about 80 nautical miles south of the nation. The strike is part of a broader U.S. anti-drug trafficking mission in the region, which has seen the destruction of several boats allegedly originating from Venezuela. The operation highlights the ongoing efforts to disrupt narcotics smuggling routes to the United States.</p>

His actions, from guest-hosting Kirk's podcast to delivering a key eulogy, show a deliberate effort to consolidate support from the activist's powerful base.

The project, centered on the island of Nantucket, aims to make wild white-footed mice—the primary carriers of the disease—immune to the Lyme bacteria. By introducing Lyme-resistant genes into the mice, ticks that feed on them would not become infected, breaking the transmission cycle. The "Mice Against Ticks" project is proceeding with extensive community consultation, allowing residents to weigh in on the decision to release the engineered animals into the wild.</p>

Federal health officials are anticipated to warn expectant mothers against using the common painkiller unless necessary for a fever. This move is reportedly being driven by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has previously shared unsupported claims about autism. The maker of Tylenol, Kenvue, has strongly refuted any causal link, stating that decades of scientific research show the medication is safe when used as directed during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a separate deadly shootout involving police in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence. Speaking on "Meet the Press," Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to focus on commonalities rather than divisions. He referenced his own experience with political violence, including a firebombing at the governor's mansion, to emphasize the lasting scars such acts leave. Shapiro stressed the importance of choosing healing and unity over continued partisan conflict.</p>

          <p>A baseball fan who caught Mike Trout's 400th career home run ball received a unique reward after agreeing to return the milestone souvenir. In addition to receiving signed memorabilia, the fan, identified as Alberto, asked the Los Angeles Angels superstar if they could play catch on the field. Trout agreed, and the two tossed a ball back and forth in a memorable moment long after the game had ended. The home run made Trout the 59th player in MLB history to reach the 400-homer mark, and the exchange provided a heartwarming conclusion to the historic achievement.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder Jacob Young secured a victory over the New York Mets with two spectacular defensive plays. The first was an extraordinary "hacky-sack" style catch, where Young juggled the ball off his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall, ultimately securing the out. Later in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the fence to rob the Mets of a potential game-tying home run. Young's defensive heroics were instrumental in the Nationals' 3-2 win, dealing a significant blow to the Mets' playoff aspirations in the tight National League wildcard race.</p>

          <p>Gabrielle has intensified into the seventh named storm and first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, reaching Category 1 strength with sustained winds of 75 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm's center to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, though no watches or warnings are currently in effect for the island. While not expected to make a direct landfall, swells generated by Gabrielle are predicted to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Canada. Forecasters warn that rapid strengthening is possible over the next few days.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the immediate goal of complete denuclearization, given that Pyongyang currently produces numerous new weapons annually. He expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume talks, citing their "degree of mutual trust." This pragmatic stance signals a shift in approach to managing the security threat posed by North Korea's expanding arsenal.</p>

          <p>A community in south Wales is grappling with a "cluster" of cases of DRPLA, a rare, inherited neurological disorder with no known cure. The disease, once thought to primarily affect people of Japanese descent, causes progressive symptoms including seizures, loss of motor control, and cognitive decline. Families are sharing their experiences to raise awareness and push for better access to genetic testing and support, as many local doctors are unfamiliar with the condition. While clinical trials in the U.S. for a potential treatment offer some hope, the community faces significant challenges in managing the devastating impact of the disease.</p>
