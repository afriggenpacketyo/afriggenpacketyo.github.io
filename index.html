          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin, a four-time Olympic medalist, has announced his retirement from the sport at the age of 28. Citing a dwindling motivation and an inability to reignite his competitive fire following the Paris Olympics, the Scottish athlete feels it is the right time to step away. Carlin expressed that he is content with his achievements over a decade-long career and is now looking forward to discovering a new identity beyond cycling. He is now exploring other interests like golf while considering his future career path.</p>

          <p>A severe fire at a four-storey garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with officials concerned the number could increase. The blaze was intensified by an adjacent, unlicensed chemical warehouse, and most fatalities were reportedly caused by inhaling toxic gas as a roof door was locked. This incident highlights the recurring issue of poor safety standards and infrastructure in the country, which has led to numerous fatal fires in recent years. Authorities are investigating the legality of the warehouse's operation as families await news of missing loved ones.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's diplomatic intervention was crucial in securing a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas, a move he celebrated as a historic achievement. However, this agreement is not a comprehensive peace plan and lacks the detailed framework and political will necessary for a long-term resolution to the conflict. The ceasefire is already showing signs of fragility, with disputes over the return of hostages' remains and renewed violence from both sides. The article argues that while Trump's deal-making was effective in the short term, the path to sustainable peace in the region remains fraught with significant obstacles and unresolved issues.</p>

Despite the challenges in the Chinese market, ASML continues to see strong orders fueled by the global AI boom, maintaining its overall sales growth forecast for the current year.

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally recommended that veterinary practices be required to publish their price lists and disclose their ownership structure. An investigation by the regulator found that pet owners are paying significantly more at practices owned by large corporate groups compared to independent vets, with overall prices rising nearly twice the rate of inflation. The proposed measures, which could also include price caps on medicines, aim to increase transparency and competition within the £6.3 billion veterinary sector. The CMA highlighted that the industry's regulatory framework is outdated and fails to regulate the businesses that own most practices.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' potent postseason offense has been largely driven by the hitters at the bottom of their lineup, who have consistently outperformed the team's top stars. In their 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the NLCS, players like Teoscar Hernández and Kiké Hernández provided the key hits, reinforcing a trend seen throughout the playoffs. This depth has allowed the Dodgers to apply relentless pressure on opposing pitchers, even when their main offensive threats are contained. The team's success demonstrates a collective trust and resourcefulness that has been crucial to their commanding 2-0 series lead.</p>

His appeal argued that he was wrongly found liable without a full trial, but the lower court had issued a default ruling due to his repeated failure to provide evidence.

          <p>A violent confrontation occurred in Chicago when two Venezuelan migrants allegedly rammed their vehicle into a Border Patrol vehicle during an immigration enforcement operation and then attempted to flee. Following their arrest, a hostile crowd formed, leading to clashes with federal agents who deployed tear gas to disperse protesters throwing objects. The Department of Homeland Security described the incident as part of a dangerous trend of violent resistance to law enforcement.

Trump has a well-known fascination with appearing on the cover of Time, which has previously asked his golf clubs to remove fake covers he had displayed. The photo has drawn mockery from political opponents and analysis from photography experts on its artistic intent.</p>

          <h2>Red Tractor Advertisement Banned for Misleading Environmental Claims</h2>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a television advertisement from Red Tractor, the country's largest farm certification scheme, for making misleading environmental claims. The ruling found that the organization provided insufficient evidence to prove its certified farms comply with basic environmental laws, thus exaggerating the scheme's benefits to the public. The complaint was brought by the environmental group River Action, which accused the scheme of "greenwashing." Red Tractor has called the decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is on animal welfare and food safety, not environmental standards.</p>

          <p>In its largest-ever forfeiture action, the U.S. Department of Justice has seized approximately $15 billion in bitcoin connected to a massive "pig butchering" investment fraud. Prosecutors have charged Chen Zhi, the alleged mastermind behind the Cambodia-based Prince Holding Group, with running the sprawling operation that targeted victims worldwide. The scheme allegedly used forced labor in scam compounds, where trafficked individuals were made to build relationships with victims online before convincing them to transfer cryptocurrency under false pretenses. The U.S. Treasury has also sanctioned Zhi and his network as a transnational criminal organization.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of six foreign nationals for posting incendiary social media comments celebrating the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individuals, from six different countries, made comments suggesting Kirk deserved to be killed. This action is part of a broader administration crackdown on such speech, with a top official stating the U.S. has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans. The move raises unresolved legal questions about the government's power to revoke visas based on speech, particularly for individuals already in the country.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties are calling on the Labour government to publish the evidence it submitted in the recently collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The prosecution was unexpectedly dropped after the government reportedly could not provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. The Crown Prosecution Service has stated it would not object to the government releasing the material, contradicting earlier government suggestions. The controversy has led to accusations of a cover-up and a weak stance on national security against China.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has voted to declare a local state of emergency due to ongoing federal immigration raids conducted by ICE. Officials state the raids have caused widespread fear, disrupted local economies, and strained public services in a county with over three million immigrants. The declaration empowers the county to mobilize resources more quickly, seek state and federal aid, and provide support like rent relief and legal services to affected residents. The move is a direct response to what local leaders call the targeting of their communities by federal actions.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene after a federal appeals court ordered a new trial for Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted of murdering 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979. The appeals court ruled that the trial judge made a critical error by incorrectly instructing the jury about how to consider Hernandez's multiple confessions, some of which were given before he received his Miranda warnings. Patz's disappearance became a landmark case that changed national responses to missing children. Prosecutors are now seeking to delay the retrial pending the Supreme Court's decision.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at increasing safety for children interacting with artificial intelligence and social media platforms. One new law requires AI "companion" chatbots to include guardrails preventing discussions of self-harm and to regularly remind minor users they are not interacting with a human. Other legislation increases penalties for creating nonconsensual "deepfake" pornography and requires social media platforms to display warning labels about potential mental health risks for young users. These laws reflect growing concerns over the failure of tech companies to prioritize the well-being of children.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), faces a more difficult route to becoming the country's first female prime minister after the LDP's coalition partner, Komeito, abruptly withdrew its support. This move leaves the LDP with a smaller minority in parliament and has prompted opposition parties to discuss uniting behind a single candidate, potentially Yuichiro Tamaki of the Democratic Party for the People. The collapse of the 26-year coalition has delayed the prime ministerial vote and created significant political uncertainty. Some analysts, however, believe this could free the LDP to pursue its own policy goals more aggressively.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol in Merced County recently stopped a Nissan Sentra for having a suspicious-looking license plate, only to discover it was a detailed, handmade replica. The driver had drawn the plate, complete with "California" lettering, the DMV website, and a registration sticker. While the CHP post on social media gave the driver "points for creativity," they also issued a $197 fine for violating the state law that requires official, state-issued license plates. The department noted the unusual nature of the stop, which highlighted a driver's artistic but illegal solution to a missing plate.</p>
