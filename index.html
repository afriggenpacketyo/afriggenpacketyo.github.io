          <p>A large-scale memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk is scheduled to take place at Arizona's State Farm Stadium, with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance among the speakers. The event follows Kirk's fatal shooting on September 10, with extensive security measures being implemented for the tens of thousands of expected mourners. Kirk, who founded Turning Point USA, will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of his significant influence in conservative politics.</p>

          <p>Major German cities are bracing for significant demonstrations focused on two contentious issues: abortion rights and climate change. In Berlin and Cologne, anti-abortion groups are holding "March for Life" rallies, which are expected to be met with large counterprotests. Simultaneously, the activist group "Fridays for Future" has organized climate protests in 70 cities, calling for an end to fossil fuel use and criticizing the government's recent decision to build new gas-fired power plants while scaling back on renewable energy expansion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "limerence," a term for romantic obsession characterized by intrusive thoughts and intense emotional highs and lows, as detailed by neuroscientist Tom Bellamy. Bellamy explains that while limerence is a natural part of early love, it can become a source of anxiety and craving if the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed signals. The article offers practical, science-based strategies for breaking free from unhealthy infatuation, such as limiting contact and actively reframing daydreams.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has revealed a deep societal division, which is being significantly widened by social media. The article analyzes how graphic videos of the event spread rapidly, while politically motivated influencers on both the left and right immediately promoted competing narratives to frame the killer's motives. This online fragmentation has created conflicting public understandings of the event, often ignoring the more complex reality presented later in official charging documents from law enforcement.</p>

It highlights how small, under-resourced water treatment facilities are particularly at risk, citing recent infiltrations in Pennsylvania and Texas. In response, a new volunteer initiative called Project Franklin is pairing cybersecurity experts with local water operators to help them identify vulnerabilities and bolster their defenses against potential sabotage that could impact public health and safety.</p>

          <p>A growing trend in Turkey sees female artists facing legal action and government pressure over their performances and public expression. This article focuses on the popular girl band Manifest, which is now under investigation for "indecent and immoral acts" following a concert. This case is presented as part of a broader, systemic effort by the Turkish government to enforce conservative values, with observers noting that pro-government media often initiates campaigns against artists before official actions are taken to silence dissent.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has unveiled its first locally-built anti-ballistic missile system, the Chiang-Kong, at a major defense technology exhibition in Taipei. The event highlights the island's dual-pronged defense strategy: enhancing its self-reliance in military hardware while also deepening cooperation with foreign partners, particularly the United States. This push for advanced, domestically-produced weaponry is a direct response to the growing military pressure and threats from Beijing, aiming to establish a more credible deterrent.</p>
