          <p>A 20-year-old man, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, has been found guilty of assaulting two police officers during a major disturbance at Manchester Airport in July of the previous year. The incident, which was widely circulated on social media, resulted in a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Amaaz was convicted of assaulting one officer causing actual bodily harm and assaulting another emergency worker. The jury could not reach a verdict on separate assault charges against Amaaz and his brother involving a third officer.</p>

          <p>The pro-Palestinian protest group Palestine Action has been granted permission by the High Court to challenge its ban under UK terrorism laws. The government proscribed the group last month following direct action protests causing significant damage to defense firms linked to Israel. The court ruled that the ban should be reviewed, citing potential conflicts with free speech rights and the risk of legal chaos in prosecuting supporters. However, the judge denied a request to temporarily pause the ban while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated surprising resilience by expanding at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations of 2.3%. This growth was largely driven by a significant decrease in imports, influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, and a rebound in consumer spending. Despite concerns over trade disputes, the data showed economic strength, although some underlying indicators suggest a potential slowdown in domestic demand. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, eased slightly but remained just above the central bank's target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while some Democrats and media outlets are increasingly critical of Israel's actions in Gaza, former President Trump and the Republican Party remain steadfast allies. The author contends that calls to cut off aid or recognize a Palestinian state reward Hamas's tactics and prolong the conflict. The piece credits Trump's Abraham Accords for fostering regional peace and asserts that his approach, rather than Western appeasement, is the key to a stable and secure Middle East. This firm stance is presented as necessary to achieve a definitive end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has articulated his strategic vision for artificial intelligence, focusing on the development of "personal superintelligence." In a letter released ahead of the company's earnings report, he contrasted his approach with industry trends, emphasizing AI as a tool for individual empowerment rather than large-scale automation. This follows Meta's multi-billion dollar investment in AI talent and infrastructure, including the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs. The move echoes his previous heavy investment in the metaverse, signaling a major long-term commitment to this new technological frontier.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has invited leaders of the resident doctors' union, the BMA, for new talks next week to resolve the ongoing dispute. While Streeting stated he would not renegotiate the recent 5.4% pay rise, he expressed willingness to discuss working conditions, such as career progression and exam fees. He warned, however, that the union's latest strike action had eroded the government's goodwill. The BMA, which argues that doctors' pay has effectively fallen by a fifth since 2008, has yet to formally respond to the invitation.</p>

          <p>Following the release of a stronger-than-expected 3% GDP growth figure, former President Donald Trump publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The economic expansion was largely influenced by a sharp drop in imports due to his administration's tariff policies. Despite the positive headline number, some economists point to underlying data, such as slowing consumer and investment metrics, suggesting the economy is losing momentum. The Fed, however, is widely expected to hold rates steady, viewing the economy as resilient enough to withstand current borrowing costs for now. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that the primary effect of the tariffs is to shift the tax burden onto lower- and middle-income Americans who spend a larger portion of their income on goods. He concludes that the policy is a form of "pocket-picking" disguised by nationalist rhetoric that will ultimately lead to slower growth and fewer international allies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's top vaccine official, has left the agency after less than three months in the role. Appointed by the Trump administration, Prasad was a vocal critic of previous FDA policies, particularly the authorization of COVID-19 boosters without new clinical data. His departure follows a social media campaign against him by a right-wing influencer who highlighted his past support for Democrats. During his brief tenure, the FDA limited COVID vaccine recommendations for younger people and overrode career staff on the approval of shots from Novavax and Moderna.</p>

          <p>Spanish telecommunications firm Telefonica announced it is replacing all 5G network equipment from Chinese manufacturer Huawei in its Spanish and German operations. The move is to comply with local regulations in those countries, which require phasing out Huawei gear from core networks due to security concerns. However, the company stated it intends to continue using Huawei equipment in Brazil and other Latin American countries where no such restrictions exist. Telefonica's COO emphasized that all providers must meet the same strict security standards to protect the company and its customers.</p>

          <p>For savers concerned about inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer returns that can outpace the inflation rate, providing a secure way to grow money. This article provides a snapshot of current CD rates as of late July 2025, noting that top offers from online banks are significantly higher than national averages. For example, some one-year CDs offer APYs around 4.40%, while five-year terms can yield up to 4.20%. The piece advises savers to look at online banks and consider short-term CDs to secure the best available rates in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

She was struck by falling rocks while climbing Laila Peak in Pakistan's Karakoram mountain range. A rescue operation was hampered by bad weather and the remote location. Dahlmeier made history at the 2018 Winter Olympics and won five gold medals at a single world championship before retiring in 2019 at age 25.

          <p>Economists widely predict that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting, despite persistent public pressure from President Trump for lower borrowing costs. The central bank has held its benchmark rate steady since December 2024 to combat inflation. With the labor market remaining solid, recent GDP growth surprising on the upside, and potential inflationary effects from new tariffs, policymakers are expected to maintain their cautious stance. While some FOMC members have signaled a desire to cut rates, the consensus remains to wait, with a potential cut now seen as more likely in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, Yuli Novak, the executive director of the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, contends that the state of Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. She argues that the actions of the Israeli military—including mass killings, engineered starvation, and widespread destruction—along with the explicit rhetoric of Israeli leaders, meet the textbook definition of the term. Novak reflects on how decades of occupation and dehumanization created the conditions for the current situation, which she says was catalyzed by the Hamas attack on October 7 where civilians were killed, sexually assaulted, and taken hostage. The article announces a new B'Tselem report detailing these claims.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca's CEO, Pascal Soriot, has revealed that the company has proposed price cuts for certain drugs in the United States. This move comes as the Trump administration continues to pressure pharmaceutical companies to lower costs for American patients, partly through a plan to tie U.S. prices to lower international ones. Soriot stated that a "rebalancing of pricing around the world is necessary," suggesting U.S. prices could be reduced while those in Europe might see modest increases. The company is also bolstering its U.S. manufacturing capabilities, aiming to produce all its medicines for U.S. patients locally.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad has departed his role as the top vaccine official at the FDA after less than four months, a government spokesperson confirmed. His appointment in the second Trump administration was controversial due to his past fierce criticism of COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

His exit, reportedly amid pressure from conservative critics, has led to a surge in the stock prices of some biotech companies, as investors see the move as a positive for the industry.
