Individuals struggling with medical debt have options such as reviewing and negotiating bills, applying for financial assistance, and considering debt relief programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The film ‚ÄúDangerous Animals‚Äù draws from serial-killer thrillers and shark survival stories, but lacks the thematic depth and narrative surprises of director Sean Byrne's previous works. The movie stars Hassie Harrison as a surfer kidnapped by a boat captain who forces her to watch another woman be devoured by sharks. Despite a promising setup, the film is a straightforward horror movie that surrenders to genre expectations. The film offers little of the grim poetry of Byrne‚Äôs previous work.</p>

          <p>Faced with a deadline to leave the military voluntarily, transgender troops are opting to stay and contest the Trump administration's ban. Some have accepted the terms, but others have vowed to fight the policy. This decision highlights the ongoing legal and personal battles surrounding transgender rights in the military. The outcome of these challenges will have significant implications for the future of transgender service members and the military's diversity policies.</p>

          <h2>DHS Memo Details National Guard Role in Immigration Enforcement</h2>

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo outlines how National Guard troops would be used for immigration enforcement activities, including "night operations and rural interdiction." The troops would also be involved in "guard duty and riot control" inside detention facilities. DHS requested 20,000 National Guard troops for these purposes, but the Pentagon has not yet approved the request. This would be the first time the National Guard has been asked to enforce an immigration crackdown within the United States, raising legal and ethical questions.</p>
