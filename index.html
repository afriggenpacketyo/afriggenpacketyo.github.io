          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 27 fatalities, including nine children, prompting officials to declare a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for dozens of missing people, including up to 25 campers from Camp Mystic. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, ensuring state resources are deployed for the extensive recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>A new, extensive autobiography by Mark Twain is being published, precisely 100 years after his death, as per his specific instructions. The work, compiled from years of daily dictations, is unconventional and non-linear, resembling a modern blog where Twain discussed whatever was on his mind. This embargo allowed him to speak freely, offering candid and often harsh opinions on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and unfiltered heartbreak over his daughter's death. Curators at UC Berkeley have spent six years reconstructing the manuscript, which is seen as both a literary event and a brilliant, long-term marketing strategy.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police in London arrested twenty-nine people on suspicion of terrorism offenses during a demonstration in Parliament Square. The protesters were showing support for Palestine Action, a group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the same day. This designation makes expressing support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government banned the group following activism that included causing an estimated £7 million in damage to military aircraft at an RAF base.</p>

          <p>India is closing in on a victory in the second Test against England, thanks to a remarkable performance by captain Shubman Gill. After scoring 269 in the first innings, Gill added another 161 runs, allowing India to set England a near-impossible target of 608. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the end of day four. India's bowler Akash Deep was instrumental, taking the crucial wickets of Ben Duckett and Joe Root, putting his team in a dominant position to level the series.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain the Science Behind 'Old People Smell'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:28:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon often described as "old people smell" is a real biological process, not just a stigma, according to experts. The distinct musty or greasy scent is largely attributed to the compound 2-nonenal, which is produced as lipids on the skin break down and oxidize with age. This compound is not easily removed by regular washing due to its fatty composition. Experts suggest that managing this age-related odor involves a holistic approach, including an antioxidant-rich diet, proper hydration, and antioxidant skincare, while also noting that sudden changes in body odor could indicate underlying health issues.</p>

Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly admitted the area lacks a river warning system and that the ferocity of the flood was entirely unexpected, despite a flood watch being in effect. The storm's sudden intensification overnight, when most residents were asleep, contributed to the disaster's severity. The rapid rise of the river, which climbed 26 feet in 45 minutes, left no time for evacuations.</p>

          <p>An inquiry with ChatGPT about billionaire tax fairness revealed that the core issue is not tax rates but how different income types are treated. The AI explained the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where wealthy individuals borrow against their appreciating assets like stocks to fund their lifestyle, as loans are not taxed as income. This allows them to avoid capital gains taxes that would be due if they sold the assets. Upon death, these assets can be passed to heirs with a stepped-up basis, largely erasing the tax liability, highlighting how the current system taxes labor more heavily than wealth.

Theron explained that due to a tumultuous family background and a tendency to "lose herself" in relationships, she realized she was not equipped to have children with a partner at the time. Relationship experts support her decision, framing it as a sign of strength, clarity, and alignment with her personal well-being. They note that choosing to be single is a valid and powerful choice for many women today.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties. This action followed a complex legal battle that reached the Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled that a lower court could not block the deportations. None of the men, who are from nations in Asia and Latin America, are citizens of South Sudan. Human rights advocates have condemned the move as "punitive and unconstitutional," expressing fears that the men could face torture or death in the conflict-ridden nation.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss the Rise of 'Tipflation' and Customer Confusion Over Digital Tipping</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems has led to "tipflation," where customers are prompted to tip in more situations and at higher suggested percentages, causing confusion and frustration. Marketing professors explain that point-of-sale devices often default to showing tip screens with pre-calculated options of 15-25%, pressuring customers to tip even in counter-service or takeaway settings. While this can increase income for service workers, it also creates social pressure and guilt, potentially leaving a negative impression on customers. The shift away from cash has made these digital tip requests more common and harder to avoid.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in downtown Indianapolis early on July 5th left two people dead and five others injured, just hours after the city's fireworks celebration concluded. One of the deceased was a juvenile, and police noted that hundreds of unsupervised youths were in the area at the time of the incident around 1:30 a.m. IMPD Chief Chris Bailey expressed frustration, stating police had already made 20 arrests and recovered guns from two children before the shooting occurred.

          <p>A "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the alcohol-free beverage can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The drink typically contains coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts say there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, as cortisol levels are complex and not easily influenced by diet. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors note that its ingredients are not proven to reduce stress, and its perceived benefits are more likely due to a placebo effect or improved hydration.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, has been rediscovered, exciting scholars in the U.S., Taiwan, and China. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the machine was a critical step in adapting the complex, non-alphabetic Chinese language for modern technology. The typewriter's ingenious design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed on computers today. The machine, found in a New York basement, has been acquired by Stanford University for restoration and display.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Parisians are officially permitted to swim in designated areas of the Seine River, a milestone celebrated by many. The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, initiated in conjunction with the previous year's Olympics, which has successfully improved water quality to meet European standards. On Saturday, Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined residents for a dip near the Eiffel Tower, marking the realization of a long-held dream to restore the iconic waterway for public recreation.

          <p>Elon Musk has suggested that a new political party, which he has considered funding, could strategically focus on a small number of key House and Senate races to maximize its influence. Amid a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Musk floated the idea of an "America Party" that could act as a deciding vote in the narrowly divided Congress. This approach would aim to challenge the two-party system by gaining leverage on contentious legislation. The proposal came as Musk polled his followers on X about forming the new party.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a massive luxury beach resort, after nearly a decade of construction. The sprawling complex features hundreds of buildings, including high-rise hotels and amenities, and is part of Kim Jong Un's long-standing goal to boost the nation's sanctions-hit economy through tourism. However, with the country still largely isolated, the resort is currently receiving domestic tourists, with Russian visitors expected to be the first foreign guests. This highlights Pyongyang's strategy of pursuing economic development alongside its military ambitions, despite significant infrastructure and geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's unexpected decision to skip the BRICS summit in Brazil has fueled speculation about potential political turbulence within China and the unity of the economic bloc. China's official explanation of a "scheduling conflict" has been met with skepticism, with some analysts suggesting it may signal internal power struggles or friction with other member nations like India. Premier Li Qiang will attend in Xi's place, continuing a trend of the Chinese leader scaling back his international appearances. The absence raises questions about the cohesion and future direction of the BRICS group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A physician working at a public hospital argues that new congressional work requirements for Medicaid will create insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles for the most vulnerable patients. The article explains that while many beneficiaries are already working or should be exempt due to disability or other factors, the administrative burden of proving this status will cause many to lose coverage. Using patient examples, the doctor illustrates how issues like homelessness, lack of internet access, and cognitive disabilities make compliance nearly impossible. The policy is criticized as a way to cut costs by disenfranchising those most in need.</p>
