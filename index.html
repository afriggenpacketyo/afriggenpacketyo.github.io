          <p>An attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, injured multiple people during a march for Israeli hostages. The incident occurred at 1:26 p.m. at 13th Street and Pearl Street, prompting police to evacuate nearby blocks and investigate a vehicle of interest. Witnesses reported that the suspect used Molotov cocktails, and some victims sustained life-threatening injuries. FBI Director Kash Patel initially described the incident as a terrorist attack, but Boulder police stated that it was too early to speculate on the attacker's motive.

Higher tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market. As Chinese companies face more trade barriers from the US, they’ll need to work even harder on cutting costs and scaling up.
