          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 13:51:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to expedite the challenge brought by two toy companies against President Trump's tariffs. Learning Resources and hand2mind, the family-owned companies, argued that Trump lacked the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on products from China. The court's decision means the Trump administration will have the standard 30-day period to respond to the challenge. This ruling delays the resolution of the companies' legal battle against the tariffs. Optimism in the business community may be affected due to this decision.</p>

The group claimed responsibility for spraying red paint on two military planes, alleging that Britain continues to support Israel militarily.

Coinbase shares also rose, as the company generates half of its revenue from interest earned on Circle's USDC reserves.

          <p>Oil prices fell more than 2% following President Trump's decision to delay potential strikes against Iran, expressing a desire to allow space for negotiations regarding its nuclear program. Brent crude fell $2.12 to $76.73 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil rose slightly to $75.18 per barrel. Despite Trump's hesitation, Israel is escalating its attacks on Iran after a week of conflict, with Prime Minister Netanyahu ordering intensified strikes on strategic targets.

          <p>President Trump is seeking to delay oral arguments in his appeal of the $83 million defamation judgment awarded to E. Jean Carroll. Trump's legal team and the Justice Department have requested the appeals court to postpone the arguments, scheduled for next week, as they pursue an appeal to have the government substitute for Trump in the case. Trump is appealing the 2024 verdict, which found him liable for defaming Carroll after she accused him of sexual assault. The 2nd Circuit recently upheld a separate $5 million damage award to Carroll.</p>

          <p>Former NBA star Vlade Divac underwent emergency surgery after breaking his hip in a motorcycle accident near the Adriatic Sea coast in Montenegro. The 57-year-old basketball Hall of Famer, who played for the Lakers and Kings, now has an artificial hip. Divac was drafted by the Lakers in 1989 and became a fan favorite before being traded to the Charlotte Hornets in 1996 for Kobe Bryant. He later played for the Sacramento Kings, where he had his jersey retired, and returned to the Lakers for his final season in 2004-05.</p>

          <p>A $100,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could provide monthly payments ranging from approximately $627 to $652 for a single life annuity, or about $570 for a joint life annuity, but the exact amount depends on factors like gender, interest rates, and payout structure. Women typically receive lower payments due to longer life expectancies, and higher interest rates at the time of purchase result in larger monthly checks. Annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income, providing financial stability and peace of mind, but may not be suitable for everyone, especially those needing more liquidity or preferring growth potential.

          <p>The Offer in Compromise (OIC) program allows eligible taxpayers to settle their tax debt with the IRS for a lower amount than what is owed. The IRS evaluates eligibility based on a taxpayer's ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, and applicants must have filed all required tax returns and made necessary estimated payments. The IRS calculates a reasonable collection potential, and the offer must equal or exceed this amount, with realistic and honest financial reporting being crucial for acceptance. Applying for an OIC requires substantial paperwork, including detailed financial statements and documentation, and the review process can take six to 24 months.</p>

          <p>President Putin stated that, in his view, "the whole of Ukraine is ours" because he considers Russians and Ukrainians to be one people. He also cautioned that Russian forces could potentially take the Ukrainian city of Sumy as part of a bid to establish a buffer zone along the border. Putin reiterated that he is not seeking Ukraine's capitulation or denying its sovereignty but insisted that Ukraine must be neutral. He also said Moscow wants Ukraine to accept the reality of Russia's control over a significant portion of Ukrainian territory.</p>
