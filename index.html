          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 01:45:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formalized new tariffs on numerous global trading partners, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%. The duties, which also include a 40% tariff on goods transshipped to evade taxes, are set to take effect on August 7, providing a short delay for implementation. While some Asian nations received lower rates than initially proposed, countries like Canada face increased duties, and the move has prompted negative reactions in financial markets. Experts anticipate continued uncertainty and the likelihood of further trade negotiations and tariff adjustments in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the new US tariff schedule, which offered some relief from previously announced higher rates. Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments after their duties were significantly reduced, viewing it as beneficial for their economies and bilateral relations. In contrast, Taiwan faces a 20% "temporary tariff" while negotiations continue, and India is subject to a 25% rate as it has not yet secured a trade deal. The varied reactions highlight the widespread impact of the US trade policy and the ongoing efforts by nations to mitigate economic consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, contain any "back door" features that would allow for remote access or control. The statement follows an inquiry from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which summoned the company over potential security vulnerabilities in the chips. This development underscores the significant challenges the U.S. tech giant faces in navigating the complex geopolitical landscape and satisfying the security demands of both Washington and Beijing. The company's shares saw a slight decline following the news from China's regulator.</p>

          <p>Florida executed Edward Zakrzewski, a man convicted of murdering his wife and two children in 1994, marking the state's ninth execution this year. This sets a new record for the highest number of executions in a single year since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The event has drawn attention to the state's active use of capital punishment, as Florida has carried out more executions this year than any other state. Opponents of the execution noted Zakrzewski's military service and the narrow 7-5 jury recommendation for his death sentence, a verdict that would not meet today's state law requirements.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide, has expressed shock over President Trump's comment that Epstein had "stolen" her from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, they called the remark objectifying and urged for answers about what the president knew at the time. The family also advocated for Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice, to remain imprisoned amid reports of a Justice Department interview with her. This development adds another layer to the ongoing questions surrounding Trump's past association with Epstein and the broader sex trafficking case.</p>

          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, known as the Rhisotope Project, is underway to combat the illegal rhino horn trade by making the horns radioactive. Scientists from the University of the Witwatersrand are injecting small, harmless amounts of radioactive material into rhino horns, which can be detected by radiation sensors at international borders and airports. This innovative method aims to disrupt trafficking networks by making the horns easier to trace and riskier to smuggle. The project hopes to protect the country's large but dwindling rhino population, which is heavily targeted by poachers for the black market.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the tragic death of Becky Zerlentes, a 34-year-old professor and amateur boxer who became the first woman to die in a sanctioned U.S. fight in 2005. After being knocked unconscious in the third round of a Colorado championship match, she never recovered and passed away the next morning. The story explores the profound impact of her death on her husband, Stephan Weiler, and the opponent, Heather Schmitz, who was initially investigated for homicide. It also connects her story to others who have lost partners to the sport, raising critical questions about boxing's inherent dangers and the lack of support for families after such tragedies.</p>

Bukele, who was re-elected in 2024 after a court ruling bypassed a previous ban on successive terms, can now run for office indefinitely.

          <h2>Opinion: US Healthcare Failures Are Not Australia's Fault</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States should look to its own systemic failures rather than blaming countries like Australia for its high healthcare costs. The author points out that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse health outcomes, including lower life expectancy. The article criticizes President Trump's claim that other countries are "freeloaders" on U.S. medical research, noting that U.S. government research funding has stagnated. Instead of bullying trade partners, the author suggests the U.S. could learn from systems like Australia's Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to achieve better results.</p>

          <p>Mike Donilon, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden, reportedly told the House Oversight Committee that he was paid $4 million for his work on the 2024 campaign and was set to receive another $4 million if the president won reelection. This testimony was part of the Republican-led committee's investigation into the former president's cognitive fitness. In his opening statement, Donilon defended Biden's leadership, asserting that he was "deeply engaged and in command on critical issues."

          <p>In her first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is "broken." Explaining her decision not to run for governor of California, she stated a desire to step away from the system for now, as she feels it is not as strong as it needs to be to defend fundamental principles. Harris clarified that she is not giving up the fight but wants to engage with Americans outside of a transactional, political context.

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analysts' expectations. While AWS remains the market leader in cloud infrastructure, it faces growing competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher growth rates in their recent earnings. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized AWS's larger business scale and highlighted the company's focus on security as a key differentiator. The cloud division continues to be a major profit driver for Amazon, although it is still navigating supply constraints to meet the surging demand for AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), to prison. The convictions are related to their involvement in violent protests against the military in May 2023 following Khan's arrest. Among those sentenced is opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, who received a 10-year term. The PTI has denounced the rulings as politically motivated and a "black day for democracy," vowing to challenge the verdict. The sentences represent a significant blow to the popular opposition party as its leader, Imran Khan, remains imprisoned on numerous charges.</p>

          <p>Annual undergraduate tuition fees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. Maintenance loans for living costs have also been increased to help students cope with rising expenses. The move comes after universities warned of significant financial pressures due to high inflation and a decline in international student enrollment, which could lead to cuts in staffing and courses. The fee hike highlights the ongoing debate around university funding and student debt, with recent changes to loan repayment rules in England expected to increase costs for many graduates.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels chose to be modest buyers at the trade deadline, acquiring veteran relief pitchers and an infielder rather than selling off assets for future prospects. General Manager Perry Minasian defended the strategy, stating the importance of the team's young core playing meaningful, competitive games in August and September for their development. This approach comes despite the team being under .500 with long odds to make the playoffs. The decision reflects owner Arte Moreno's resistance to a full rebuild, aiming to remain competitive each year even if it means forgoing opportunities to strengthen the team's farm system for the long term.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has labeled "his gift to the country." The new building, which will replace the current East Wing, is designed to host large-scale events for up to 650 guests, addressing the capacity limitations of the existing East Room. According to the White House, the project will be funded by President Trump and other "patriot donors." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948 and is a significant part of the president's ongoing redecoration efforts.</p>
