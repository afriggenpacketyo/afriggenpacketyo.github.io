          <p>Nearly 50 years after the sexual assault and murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims with her death. Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. A thumbprint found on a cigarette carton in the victim's car matched Sims after the FBI upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm. Sims, who was stationed at Fort Ord in 1977, was already convicted of assault to commit murder and robbery in 1978. The victim's son expressed gratitude for the investigators' persistence in solving the case.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, 81, was convicted of 23 felony counts of financial fraud after offering the victim so-called "investment opportunities" with promised high interest and no risk. Prosecutors revealed that Cohen-Roth was operating a Ponzi scheme, using funds from new investors to pay off earlier ones and support a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute as a result of the scheme.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan agreed to a cease-fire on Saturday after days of intense fighting, but reports of continued violence emerged shortly after the announcement. The agreement, which followed missile, drone, and artillery strikes, was initially attributed to U.S. mediation, a claim disputed by India. Cross-border firing was reported on both sides of the border dividing Kashmir, the disputed region between the two nations. The conflict began after a terrorist attack in Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, which Pakistan denies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease considering the economic damage caused by climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively eliminates the use of the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to weigh the costs and benefits of policies related to carbon emissions. The administration cited uncertainties in calculating the figure and questioned the scientific consensus on pollution's role in climate change. Critics argue that this decision ignores the reality of climate change and its economic consequences.</p>

          <p>The recent escalation between India and Pakistan over Kashmir highlights the enduring tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.

The conflict's origins trace back to the 1947 partition and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir, which both countries claim. The threat of escalation is particularly concerning given both nations' nuclear capabilities and the potential for miscalculation.</p>

The Kremlin responded by accusing European leaders of confrontational remarks, while indicating they would consider the proposal, calling it a new development.</p>
