          <p>British supermodel David Gandy reflects on his nearly 25-year career, noting his inspiration from female supermodels and his desire to achieve greater pay equity in a female-dominated industry. He expresses significant concern over the rise of artificial intelligence, which he sees as an existential threat to models, photographers, and other artists in fashion. Along with over 2,000 other models, Gandy is calling on the UK government to regulate AI to protect human creators and prevent the industry's potential decline.</p>

In a video released by a Ukrainian brigade, Kibet explains he traveled to Russia for athletic competitions but was deceptively made to sign a military contract and sent for minimal training before being deployed. His family in Kenya is shocked and is appealing to their government for intervention, hoping for his safe return.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has announced his intention to resign amid pressure from the Trump administration to file criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources report that investigators found insufficient evidence to support mortgage fraud allegations against James, a frequent political opponent of President Trump. Trump publicly stated he wanted Siebert removed, leading to criticism that the move is a politically motivated attack on the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Russia has revived Intervision, a Soviet-era song contest, as its alternative to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The event is a clear geopolitical project, featuring 23 participating countries from Russia's political and economic allies in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. While the Kremlin frames it as cultural cooperation, critics, particularly in Ukraine, view it as a propaganda tool designed to show that Russia is not isolated on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Major US tech companies, including Microsoft and Google, have announced tens of billions of pounds in new investments in the United Kingdom, fueling optimism that the country could become a global AI superpower. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at British pessimism, highlighting the nation's strong foundation in tech research. However, critics like Sir Nick Clegg caution that the UK may just be picking up "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," raising questions about whether this influx of capital will truly transform the economy or simply increase its dependence on American tech giants.</p>

He emphasized that playing the violent gangster for over a decade has been a defining part of his career, though he is nothing like the character in real life.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed its Typhon missile system to a marine base in Japan for a joint military exercise, marking the first time such a weapon has been in the Asia-Pacific region since a Cold War-era treaty expired. The land-based system is capable of launching missiles with a range of over 500km. This move is expected to be viewed by China as a significant threat, likely prompting Beijing to accelerate the development of its own counterstrike systems and escalating regional military tensions.</p>

          <p>A senior UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During Trump's state visit, he implied military force could be a solution, but UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that the UK Border Force is responsible for border security. Kyle stated that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense and addressing global security threats.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has thrown out President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, characterizing the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the filing for its excessive length and "florid" details that violate federal rules requiring simple and concise allegations. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to submit a shorter, amended complaint that complies with the court's procedural standards.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to approve a massive $2.6-billion expansion of its downtown Convention Center ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games. The decision comes with stark warnings from the city's own financial analysts, who cautioned that the project is a risky bet that will likely divert hundreds of millions of dollars from essential city services like police and fire departments for decades. Proponents, however, argue the investment is necessary to create jobs and revitalize the city's economy.</p>
