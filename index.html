          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which encompasses President Trump's legislative agenda, but the Senate is expected to make significant changes. Senate Republicans, while aiming to pass Trump's agenda swiftly, intend to modify the bill, particularly concerning its addition of trillions to the national debt. Some senators are calling for steeper spending cuts, while others express conditional support, acknowledging the need for further work. The Senate's modifications risk complications when the bill returns to the House, with a Fourth of July deadline set for both chambers to pass it.</p>

          <p>Despite a 20-year ban on filmmaking and international travel, dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi presented his latest feature, "It Was Just an Accident," at the Cannes Film Festival, receiving an eight-minute standing ovation.

Panahi, who was arrested in 2022 and later released, insists on continuing to make films as an act of resistance against censorship, refusing to submit his scripts to the Islamic Guidance Ministry for approval.

Critics argue that Trump is using his presidency to enrich himself through crypto, while the White House denies any conflicts of interest. Trump's views on cryptocurrency have evolved, now embracing the industry, and his family holds a majority stake in a crypto exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida suggested that President Trump possesses the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and a precedent from a 1970s court case involving a Japanese zipper company. However, the judge transferred the lawsuit challenging Trump's tariffs to the Court of International Trade in New York.

He emphasizes that Harvard, despite its flaws, contributes significantly to knowledge and innovation, and that the appropriate response is to diagnose and remedy specific issues rather than dismantle the institution.

Scoring requirements are more demanding, particularly for soldiers in combat roles, with sex-neutral combat standards.

          <p>A Cooper's hawk in West Orange, New Jersey, has been observed using a pedestrian crosswalk signal to ambush prey. The hawk exploits the rhythmic clicking sound of the signal to anticipate traffic congestion, using the line of cars as cover to approach a residential yard where small birds gather. This ingenious hunting strategy demonstrates the hawk's cognitive abilities, including creating a mental map of the neighborhood and understanding the relationship between the traffic signal and the pileup of cars. This behavior highlights the flexibility and adaptability of animals in human environments.</p>

          <p>A luxury jetliner gifted by Qatar is awaiting a specialized overhaul to transform it into the next Air Force One, but experts caution that the conversion will take years. Despite President Trump's desire for a quick turnaround, the gifted plane requires extensive modifications to meet the high-tech communication, defense, and security standards of Air Force One. Concerns have also been raised about potential listening devices or malware on the plane, further complicating the conversion process. The conversion is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen, China's top exporting city, experienced a 2.9% year-on-year decline in export value during April, contrasting with the 8.1% national export growth. This suggests that the city's trade sector remains vulnerable to global tensions, particularly the tariff war with the US. The decline was primarily driven by an 8.3% drop in general trade, highlighting the city's dependence on foreign trade and limited room for policy maneuvers. Despite the volatility, the government is urged to prepare for future challenges and strengthen relationships with trading partners.</p>
