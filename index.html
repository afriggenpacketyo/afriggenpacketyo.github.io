          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight downturn following the release of mixed first-quarter results and cautious guidance for the upcoming period. The company anticipates gross profit growth in the high-teens percentage range, slightly below analysts' expectations, while revenue is projected to expand at a mid-20s percentage rate. Shopify's CFO, Jeff Hoffmeister, acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which could impact the company's merchants, though he expects the expiration of the de minimis exemption to have limited effect in the short term. The company is actively monitoring the situation to support its merchants amidst potential market changes.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden discussed his relationship with Vice President Kamala Harris and her loss in the 2024 presidential election on ABC's "The View," attributing her defeat to sexism and racism. Biden emphasized Harris's qualifications but acknowledged the challenges she faced due to societal biases. He also mentioned ongoing self-reflection and plans to write a book, while refraining from commenting on Harris's future political aspirations, including speculation about a potential gubernatorial run or a 2028 presidential bid. Biden expressed hope that Harris would remain engaged in a significant capacity, though he stopped short of endorsing a specific path for her.</p>

The Associated Press reported that Fetterman became agitated, repeating himself and shouting, leading an aide to end the meeting and break down in tears.

Fetterman's office responded by dismissing these concerns as lies from disgruntled former staffers, while reaffirming his support for teachers and public education.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to terminate funding for over 1,000 AmeriCorps grant programs has drawn criticism and legal action. The cuts impact various initiatives, including child abuse prevention, rural education, and disaster relief, disproportionately affecting states and communities that supported Trump in the 2024 election. Impacted organizations argue that the funding cuts are causing "damage and chaos," jeopardizing community assistance projects and potentially leading to staff layoffs. Several lawsuits have been filed, challenging the administration's decision and seeking to halt the dismantling of AmeriCorps, while attorneys general have also filed a separate federal lawsuit to avert the cuts.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will cease tracking the financial impact of climate crisis-fueled weather disasters, such as floods, heatwaves, and wildfires. This move is the latest in a series of changes under the Trump administration that limit federal government resources dedicated to climate change. The agency's National Centers for Environmental Information will no longer update its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024, raising concerns among scientists and policymakers about the ability to assess and address the escalating costs of extreme weather events. Critics argue that this decision will make it more difficult to understand the increasing disaster losses linked to climate change.</p>

Kennedy Jr. suggested the possibility of the policy returning, pointing to higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic. The Trump administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare under talks launched by the Biden administration, but only for its uses to treat diabetes and other health conditions.</p>

The law mandates that clergy report child abuse or neglect, even if learned during confession, which has traditionally been considered privileged. The Archdiocese of Seattle has threatened to excommunicate priests who comply with the legislation, while the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation, citing potential First Amendment violations.</p>

          <p>Several states, including Arkansas, Ohio, and Arizona, are reviving efforts to implement Medicaid work requirements, raising concerns among low-income Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. These requirements, which mandate that beneficiaries work a certain number of hours to maintain coverage, were previously blocked by courts. Critics argue that these measures are primarily aimed at reducing Medicaid enrollment and could lead to significant hardship for those unable to meet the work requirements due to illness, disability, or caregiving responsibilities.</p>

More than a million Californians are receiving payments of $21.65, distributed by check, direct deposit, or Venmo. The settlement stems from allegations that three gasoline trading firms manipulated gas prices in 2015, violating California antitrust laws. The companies allegedly took advantage of a market disruption following an explosion at an Exxon Mobile refinery to drive up gas prices for their own profit.</p>
