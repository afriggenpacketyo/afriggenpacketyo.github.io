          <h2>Trump Considers Tax Hike on Wealthy to Protect Medicaid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:15:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent, in an effort to help protect Medicaid. This move would partially reverse tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the top bracket rate to 37 percent. Trump's proposal aims to offset the cost of tax cuts and alleviate concerns about cutting Medicaid benefits to fund tax reductions for the wealthy. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>Newspapers are reporting on a new trade deal between the US and the UK, with the Daily Mail emphasizing it was 'made by Brexit' to save the British car industry from American tariffs. The Financial Times notes it's the first US trade deal since the start of the 'Trump war,' securing concessions on car and steel exports but not reversing a 10% levy on most goods. The Times highlights the deal's 'historic' nature, saving jobs while benefiting American beef and ethanol. The Daily Telegraph reports the US can object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim the government disputes. The Metro humorously declares 'the future's orange!' alongside a picture of President Trump.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:10:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a significant shift from its protectionist trade policies. This potential deal comes as the U.S. is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024. Experts suggest that a trade agreement could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding access to global markets. However, some analysts caution that zero tariffs might impact India's domestic manufacturing ambitions, although the overall effect on sectors like steel, pharmaceuticals, and auto parts may be limited.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department arrested 44-year-old Samuel Patrick Groft for allegedly cutting down 13 trees in downtown Los Angeles over seven days, causing over $170,000 in damages. The bizarre crime spree, initially unnoticed, gained attention after images of downed trees circulated on social media. Tips from the public, including surveillance footage, helped police track down Groft, who was found with a spray-painted electric chainsaw. Groft has pleaded not guilty to felony vandalism charges, and his motive remains unclear, although he reportedly claimed to love trees and be an arborist upon his arrest.</p>

          <p>Cameron Hamilton, the acting head of FEMA, was removed from his position after he publicly stated that FEMA should not be eliminated, contradicting President Trump's suggestion to disband the agency.

His removal highlights the ongoing debate about FEMA's role and future, especially as the agency faces increasing demands due to the rising frequency and severity of natural disasters. David Richardson has replaced Hamilton as acting administrator amid concerns about FEMA's staffing levels and preparedness for the upcoming hurricane season.</p>

The company's comparable sales increased 5% year over year in the first five weeks of the second quarter, driven by traffic and pricing growth. While the company raised its commodity cost inflation outlook for the year, analysts believe Texas Roadhouse's brand strength and value proposition will help it navigate economic uncertainties.

A recent Gaelic Players Association survey indicated that 70% of players experience discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% want the option to wear shorts.

          <p>The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK, loaned from China. Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material. The samples were collected on China's Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020. Professor Anand's team hopes to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth by grinding and zapping the dust with lasers. The specs of dust must be kept free from contamination on Earth.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is planning 'previously unthinkable' cuts to try to balance the books, health bosses say. Services including diabetes care for young people, rehab centres and talking therapies are in the firing line, according to NHS Providers, which represents health managers. Staff, including doctors and nurses, also face the axe - and some NHS trusts are stopping overtime for doctors, putting the drive to cut the hospital waiting lists at risk. NHS Providers said some of the savings were 'eye-watering'.</p>

This investigation is part of a broader pressure campaign on elite universities, following similar inquiries into Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.

Despite initial resistance and legal challenges, Harvard leaders recognize the long-term implications of the conflict, which could undermine its pre-eminence. The administration has threatened to choke off grant money indefinitely, forcing Harvard to consider working with Trump or seeking alternative funding sources. The university has already implemented a hiring freeze and started layoffs, and is exploring ways to operate with a smaller pool of research funds.</p>

The Hong Kong authorities have also set up a national security hotline, receiving numerous tip-offs. This has created pressure on those reported, with many facing arrests and emigration from the city.
