          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a significant meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House to discuss ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip. The high-stakes discussion will take place in the Oval Office, followed by a working lunch and a joint press address. This meeting occurs as the Trump administration also engages in critical domestic negotiations, with the president slated to meet bipartisan congressional leaders later the same day in an attempt to avert an impending government shutdown.</p>

          <p>As another potential U.S. government shutdown looms, this article provides a historical overview of the 14 times federal funding has lapsed since 1980. It details the political circumstances, duration, and outcomes of past shutdowns under presidents from Reagan to Trump, highlighting how these events have become more frequent and disruptive over the past decade. The analysis explains that prior to 1980, agencies often continued operating during funding gaps, but a series of legal opinions changed this practice, leading to the furloughs and service interruptions now associated with these political standoffs.</p>

          <p>With a potential federal government shutdown looming, this article offers financial preparation advice for government employees who may face furloughs or, in an unprecedented move, mass layoffs threatened by the Trump administration. Financial experts recommend that workers immediately assess their cash flow, track all expenses, and create a budget for reduced income. Workers are also advised to contact lenders about potential hardship assistance, such as payment deferrals, and to research unemployment benefits and health insurance options like COBRA or ACA marketplace plans in case of job loss.</p>

          <p>A violent incident at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, has left at least four people dead and several others injured. Authorities report that a 40-year-old suspect drove his vehicle through the church's front doors during a service with about 100 people present, then began shooting with an assault rifle before a fire broke out. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of targeted violence, and officials have indicated that some individuals may still be unaccounted for within the heavily damaged structure.</p>

          <p>President Trump is promoting a 21-point plan aimed at resolving the conflict in Gaza, which notably includes a pathway to a Palestinian state, a long-standing point of contention with Israel. Key provisions demand the release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the disarmament of Hamas, and the reform of the Palestinian Authority. The plan, developed with input from several Arab nations and the Tony Blair Institute, would establish a transitional government to administer Gaza while ensuring international aid can enter unimpeded.</p>

          <p>The U.S. electric vehicle market is poised for a significant test as federal purchase incentives of up to $7,500 are set to expire, leading to questions about the 'natural demand' for EVs. After a record-breaking third quarter, analysts and auto executives from companies like GM and Hyundai anticipate a sharp, short-term drop in sales as the financial motivation for consumers is removed. The end of these long-standing credits, part of the Trump administration's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' will challenge automakers to sustain growth based on product appeal and affordability alone.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland. The legal action follows President Trump's announcement that he would send federal forces to protect federal property, such as ICE facilities, from protesters he labeled 'domestic terrorists.' Oregon's Attorney General argues the president lacks the authority to federalize the state's National Guard for this purpose, with Governor Tina Kotek and other local officials insisting that federal intervention is unnecessary and an abuse of power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist challenges conventional self-care advice, suggesting that the most effective way to manage stress is not to focus inward but to channel stress-related energy outward by helping others. Research indicates that stress releases oxytocin, a hormone that motivates social connection, meaning the stress response is inherently social. Engaging in acts of service or support for colleagues, friends, or the community can activate the brain's reward centers and reduce activity in stress-related regions, effectively rewiring the brain to handle pressure more effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police is consulting on a new policy that would require officers and staff to declare if they are members of the Freemasons. This proposal follows a recommendation from the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel, which investigated a high-profile unsolved murder and noted that officers' membership in the secretive fraternity had been a source of suspicion and mistrust. While the force stated the move is to ensure impartiality, the Metropolitan Police Federation has raised concerns that it could violate officers' human rights to privacy and freedom of association.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international player union report has highlighted the excessive workload of elite footballers, using Moroccan star Achraf Hakimi as a prime example of a player pushed to physical limits. Last season, Hakimi played 69 matches for his club and country, far exceeding the recommended limit of 55, with his season lasting nearly a full year and allowing for only a 22-day offseason. The FIFPRO report raises concerns about the lack of rest and recovery time for modern players, warning that the demanding schedule increases the risk of injury and burnout.</p>

          <p>The governor's race in New Jersey between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli is being closely watched as a key indicator of the national political mood during President Trump's second term. Though traditionally a blue state, New Jersey has shown a rightward trend, making this election potentially more telling than the concurrent race in Virginia. National Democrats are investing heavily in Sherrill's campaign, hoping a victory will serve as a 'shot across the bow' against the Trump administration ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a 25-year trade agreement providing duty-free access for many sub-Saharan African nations to the U.S. market, is set to expire. While the deal fostered growth in sectors like textiles, its overall impact was varied, and its end now forces African countries to seek new opportunities and strengthen other partnerships. Economists view this as a chance for Africa to reduce dependency, advance the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and deepen economic ties with other major partners like China and the European Union.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively considering a request from Ukraine to purchase long-range Tomahawk missiles, which have a range capable of reaching Moscow from Ukrainian territory. Vice President JD Vance confirmed the request is being reviewed under a new policy where European NATO allies would finance the sale of U.S. weapons to Ukraine. The potential transfer of such advanced, deep-strike weaponry would mark a significant escalation in military support for Kyiv and has drawn a sharp response from the Kremlin, which is analyzing the implications of such a delivery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned that a new online booking system for GP appointments, set to launch across England, could jeopardize patient safety by failing to properly distinguish between urgent and non-urgent cases. The union argues that without adequate safeguards, serious health issues could be missed, and practices could be overwhelmed by an 'online triage tsunami' without additional staff to manage the demand. Despite the government's insistence that the system modernizes access to care, the BMA is threatening a formal dispute if changes are not made.</p>
