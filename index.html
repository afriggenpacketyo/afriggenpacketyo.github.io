          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a rally on Friday after reports surfaced that President Trump intends to sign executive orders aimed at accelerating reactor construction and securing vital materials for the industry. Companies like Oklo and NuScale saw significant jumps in their stock prices, while Constellation Energy and Cameco Corp also benefited from the news. The orders are expected to invoke the Defense Production Act, declaring a national emergency due to the U.S.'s reliance on Russia and China for enriched uranium and nuclear fuel processing. Additionally, federal agencies will be directed to expedite the permitting and siting of new nuclear facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased on Friday as President Trump's trade war threats prompted investors to seek safer assets. Trump's Truth Social posts suggested implementing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., leading to market instability. The 30-year Treasury yield fell by 3 basis points to 5.039%, while the 10-year Treasury shed 5 basis points to 4.507%. These moves followed a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones if the company does not shift some of its production to the United States. In a Truth Social post, Trump stated that he expects iPhones sold in America to be manufactured domestically, not in India or elsewhere. This threat comes after Apple's supplier, Foxconn, announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations. Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading following the announcement. The article notes that analysts believe manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. would significantly increase the cost of the devices.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, asserting that the decision to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students is a violation of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment. Harvard President Alan Gerber refuted these claims, stating that the university did respond to the Department of Homeland Security's requests as required by law. The lawsuit accuses the administration of waging a retaliatory attack due to the university's support for policies the administration opposes.</p>

          <p>Skeletal remains discovered on New Jersey beaches between 1995 and 2013 have been identified as Captain Henry Goodsell of the schooner Oriental, which sank in 1844. The identification was made possible through investigative genetic genealogy conducted by the New Jersey State Police and Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center. Students at Ramapo College researched the case, connecting the remains, known as "Scattered Man John Doe," to ancestry matches dating back to the 1600s. The Oriental sank off the coast of Brigantine Shoal while transporting marble, resulting in the death of all five crew members.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece on Fox News, David Marcus argues that pro-Palestine groups, particularly those supporting Hamas, should be banned from college campuses, drawing a comparison to hate groups like the KKK. He asserts that these groups promote violence and antisemitism, citing the call to "globalize the intifada" as an invitation to murder civilians. Marcus contends that there is no distinction between being pro-Palestinian and advocating for the destruction of Israel, and questions why universities would allow themselves to be associated with such ideologies. He advocates for colleges to judge the pro-Palestinian movement based on its actions, arguing that it embraces violence and terrorism.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from implementing mass layoffs and reorganizing major federal agencies. Judge Susan Illston ruled that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force that disregard congressional mandates. The order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. Illston emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress creates and funds federal agencies, assigning them duties they must carry out by statute. The judge stated that a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the pros and cons of using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) this summer. Experts suggest HELOCs can be beneficial for taking advantage of falling interest rates, consolidating credit card debt, and tackling home repairs or renovations. However, they advise against using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as they carry the risk of foreclosure if payments are not met. The article also explores using HELOCs for college costs or buying a new house, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and considering alternative options first. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite some politicians, like Hungary's Viktor OrbÃ¡n and Argentina's Javier Milei, cultivating ties with the American right, Trump has shown a willingness to act against their interests. Examples include Trump's negotiations with Hamas and Iran, criticism of Apple's move to India, and imposition of tariffs on countries led by right-wing leaders.

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on all goods imported to the United States from the European Union, citing stalled discussions. He also stated he would impose a minimum 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in America. Analysts are uncertain whether these threats will materialize, but they have already impacted markets. The EU has yet to comment on the proposed tariffs, which are scheduled to coincide with upcoming trade talks. Shares in both the US and EU dropped following the tariff announcements.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn on Friday after President Trump threatened the European Union and Apple with significant tariffs. The S&P 500 fell over 1% as trading commenced in New York, while European markets also saw similar declines. Trump announced a potential 50% tariff on EU goods, citing stalled trade negotiations, and proposed a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. Analysts suggest that the 50% tariffs are unlikely to be implemented long-term due to their potential harm to the U.S. economy, predicting they are a tactic to secure a trade agreement.</p>

The call comes as countries grapple with Trump's aggressive trade policy, particularly his "Liberation Day" tariffs.

          <p>New research reveals that clownfish shrank in size during a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea in 2023, suggesting it may be an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. Scientists measured 134 clownfish monthly between February and August, finding that most of the fish got shorter by a few millimeters. Being smaller may help clownfish meet their energy requirements in a hot climate, and the fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival. This study adds complexity to the understanding of how marine life is affected by climate change.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Mission: Impossibleâ€”The Final Reckoning, noting its shift from a focus on espionage and action to a character study of Ethan Hunt. While the film contains the series' signature stunts and globe-trotting adventures, it is encumbered by its attempt to bring cohesion to Hunt's past missions. The author argues that the self-importance of the film detracts from the lighthearted and entertaining elements that propelled the franchise to its peaks. The review acknowledges the impressive action sequences but finds the film's triumphalism about Hunt the man somewhat underwhelming.</p>

This process allows for quicker deportations without a court hearing for migrants lacking proper documents and unable to prove they have been in the U.S. for over two years.

If enacted, the bill would likely slow EV sales and production in the U.S., putting the country behind China and Europe. The measure would eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases and impose a $250 annual fee on EV owners. The bill also aims to cut taxes primarily for high-income households and businesses. It is estimated that the U.S. would sell eight million fewer electric vehicles by 2030.</p>
