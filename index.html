          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has reinstated almost all of the 381 books previously removed from its libraries. This reversal follows a new review using standardized Pentagon search terms for DEI titles. The Navy initially removed the books based on its own search terms, but the new review identified only a few titles needing further assessment by a DOD panel. Cmdr. Tim Hawkins, a Navy spokesperson, confirmed that the majority of the books are back in circulation, ensuring compliance with directives from the President and Department of Defense.</p>

          <h2>House Republican Budget Bill Proposes Increased Child Tax Credit</h2>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a budget bill that would increase the maximum child tax credit to $2,500 per eligible child, starting in 2025. However, the plan has been criticized for not benefiting the 17 million children currently excluded from the $2,000 credit. The proposal also requires both parents to have a Social Security number, potentially excluding 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. While the bill aims to provide relief, it may leave out the neediest families.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department plans to discontinue the manufacturing of pennies due to rising production costs. The penny, which costs more to make than its face value, will be phased out once the current supply of blanks runs out in early 2026. This move is expected to save the U.S. Mint approximately $56 million annually. The decision follows previous scrutiny from the Trump administration, which deemed the penny too costly to produce.</p>

          <p>Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state law regulating air-pollution monitoring, arguing that it violates their constitutional rights. The law imposes requirements on community testing activities, including using federally-approved equipment and restricting data analysis and sharing. Community groups claim the law's restrictions hinder their ability to monitor and report toxic pollution from refineries and chemical plants, particularly in areas like Cancer Alley.</p>

          <p>If you're struggling with tax debt, it's crucial to ask the right questions before engaging a tax relief specialist. Key questions include: What tax relief options am I eligible for?

And what are your fees, and how do I know this will be worth it? Understanding these aspects can help you make informed decisions and resolve your tax debt efficiently (not investment advice).</p>
