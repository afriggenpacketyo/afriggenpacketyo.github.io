          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the term "obliteration" accurately describes the damage inflicted on Iranian nuclear sites following recent U.S. strikes. This statement comes despite ongoing assessments of the full extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities. General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, but refrained from confirming total obliteration. The strikes, initiated early Saturday, involved U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bombers and Navy submarines targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities. </p>

The mission included in-flight refuelings, fighter jet escorts, and the deployment of deception tactics. The B-2s dropped GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on the Fordo and Natanz sites, while Tomahawk missiles targeted Isfahan; initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites. </p>

The suspect, a 31-year-old man, arrived at the church armed with a long gun and handgun and began firing at the building. A parishioner struck the suspect with their vehicle, and at least two staff members shot at him, killing him. One staff member, a security guard, was shot in the leg but is expected to recover. </p>

          <p>China has criticized the United States and Israel, calling for de-escalation of the conflict with Iran and emphasizing the importance of civilian safety and adherence to international law. China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, stated that Washington's actions have violated Iranian sovereignty and undermined the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. While the UN Security Council discussed the conflict, divisions emerged along geopolitical lines, with China and Russia defending Iran and the US and its allies defending Israel. Beijing's criticism was largely diplomatic, while Moscow expressed stronger condemnation. </p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining attention as Japan faces a potential shortage of giant pandas, with all pandas currently in the country scheduled to return to China. Foreign affairs experts suggest that China may loan new pandas to Japan as a gesture to stabilize relations amid increasing tensions with the United States. The panda is seen as a symbol of friendship, and a new loan could coincide with a potential visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. However, some analysts doubt the gesture will have the same diplomatic weight as it once did. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships has identified five "toxic" phrases that can hinder children's cooperation. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying," often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the study suggests using language that respects a child's autonomy and fosters a sense of emotional safety. Alternative phrases include explaining the reasoning behind decisions, giving children agency over their actions, and validating their emotions. The real secret to getting kids to listen is creating conditions where cooperation feels natural. </p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported to police for suspected cyberstalking offences, raising concerns about the normalization of digital surveillance. Experts argue that constant online monitoring, often seen as a sign of love and care, can fuel concerning behaviors. The Crime Survey for England and Wales found that people aged 16 to 19 were most likely to be victims of stalking. The government is introducing measures to allow victims to learn their stalker's identity quickly and expand the use of Stalking Protection Orders. </p>

Trump warned Iran against retaliating, stating that any retaliation would be met with force greater than what was witnessed. The U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically, stating that regime change is not planned, but homeland security officials are monitoring for potential physical and cyber reprisals. </p>
