          <p>Susan Monarez has been ousted as the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention less than a month after her confirmation by the Senate. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed her departure but did not provide a reason for the sudden removal. Monarez had been serving as the agency's acting head since January before her party-line confirmation in late July. This unexpected leadership change at a critical public health agency raises questions about its stability and direction moving forward.</p>

          <p>To mark the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death, his family, friends, and officials are retracing the train journey he took from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955. The commemorative ride is organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center and includes his cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., the last living eyewitness to the kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was brutally murdered for allegedly whistling at a white woman. His mother's decision to have an open-casket funeral exposed the brutality of racism and is credited with helping to ignite the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire during a morning Mass at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injuring 17 others, including 14 children. The 23-year-old suspect, identified as Robin Westman, fired a rifle through the church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The attack, which occurred at the start of the school year, has prompted a massive law enforcement response and a federal investigation into a possible hate crime. Officials praised the heroic actions of teachers who protected students during the incident.</p>

          <p>Kinloch Castle, a Victorian-era hunting lodge on the Scottish Isle of Rum, is back on the market with an asking price over £750,000. The property, owned by the government agency NatureScot, is in need of significant restoration after a previous sale to a millionaire businessman fell through. The local community of about 40 residents has expressed a strong desire for any new owner to be committed to supporting the island's nature and economy. The sale represents a unique opportunity to restore a significant piece of Scottish heritage while integrating with the small island community.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Alex Padilla of California deflected questions about a potential run for governor in 2026, stating his current focus is on a November special election to redraw the state's congressional districts. While not ruling out a future candidacy, Padilla emphasized the importance of the redistricting effort, which he framed as a necessary counter to Republican attempts to "rig the system." The gubernatorial field remains open after former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to run, leaving many voters undecided. Padilla highlighted his extensive experience in California politics as a potential asset for the role.</p>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV and Fox Corp. have reached a short-term contract extension, preventing Fox channels like Fox News and Fox Sports from being removed from the streaming service. The previous agreement was set to expire just days before major college football and NFL games were scheduled to air. The dispute centers on the fees YouTube TV pays to carry Fox's content, which Google claims are "far higher" than those for comparable offerings. This temporary truce allows service to continue for YouTube TV's 9.4 million subscribers while negotiations for a new long-term deal proceed.</p>

Current HELOC rates are significantly lower than those for personal loans and credit cards, making it one of the most affordable borrowing methods available. Furthermore, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the variable rates on HELOCs are positioned to become even cheaper. Rising home equity levels also mean that homeowners have a larger pool of funds to draw from for major expenses or investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Abraham Shafi, the founder and CEO of the social media app IRL, has been federally indicted on charges of wire fraud, securities fraud, and obstruction.

Shafi is accused of concealing marketing expenses and using investor funds for lavish personal purchases, including his wedding.

          <p>President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has sparked a debate among liberals regarding the principle of central bank independence. While many view the move as another assault on democratic institutions, some progressives argue that the Fed's insulation from political oversight is inherently undemocratic. This article explores the tension between defending established norms against authoritarian overreach and pursuing a more democratic approach to economic governance. The analysis suggests that while the Fed's structure could be more representative, Trump's actions are procedurally anti-democratic and aimed at subordinating national economic interests to his personal political goals.</p>
