            <h2>BP Faces Shareholder Opposition Over Shift in Green Strategy</h2>

            <p>Oil giant BP is anticipating a shareholder revolt at its upcoming annual general meeting due to its recent decision to scale back renewable energy investments and increase spending on oil and gas. Major investors, including Legal & General and Robeco, plan to vote against the reelection of BP's chair, Helge Lund, citing concerns over the company's revised energy transition strategy and lack of shareholder consultation. This shift comes as BP seeks to boost investor confidence and short-term returns, but it has raised questions about the company's long-term commitment to climate goals amid potential takeover interest from rivals like Shell and Exxon Mobil. The outcome of the shareholder vote will indicate the level of investor dissatisfaction with BP's current direction.</p>

            <p>Fraudsters are increasingly using sophisticated fake banking apps to deceive individuals selling goods online, meeting them in person, and faking bank transfers.

Reports of such crimes are rising, with some apps even previously available on the Google Play store. Experts warn that this scam highlights the need for increased vigilance when dealing with in-person transactions, as online safety measures are not enough to prevent this type of fraud.</p>

            <p>A widespread power outage has plunged Puerto Rico into darkness, affecting all 1.4 million customers and disrupting Easter weekend preparations. The blackout has led to widespread frustration and renewed calls for the government to cancel its contract with Luma Energy, the company responsible for power transmission and distribution. Governor Jenniffer González has pledged to investigate the outage and consider alternatives to Luma, acknowledging the unacceptability of the island's chronic power issues. The blackout has also impacted water services, leaving hundreds of thousands without access to water, and has disrupted businesses and tourism.</p>

            <p>Bobby Miller struggled in his first MLB start of 2025 after being called up from triple-A, giving up six runs in three innings against the Colorado Rockies. Despite Miller's poor performance, the Dodgers managed to secure an 8-7 victory, completing a three-game series sweep. The Dodgers' offense exploded for seven runs in the first inning, providing enough of a cushion for the bullpen to hold on for the win. Miller's struggles raise concerns about the Dodgers' pitching depth and his ability to regain his form from early 2024.</p>

The EU's experience with China, where Beijing used both incentives and retaliatory measures to influence EU member states' decisions on tariffs, has highlighted the bloc's vulnerability to superpower influence. Now, the EU is considering employing similar strategies against the US, signaling a shift in its approach to trade relations with its traditional ally. This shift underscores the increasing complexity of global trade dynamics and the challenges to maintaining unity within the EU.</p>

            <p>China is shifting its strategy in the trade war with the United States, moving beyond tariffs on goods to target the American services sector. This includes measures such as tightening export controls on rare-earth minerals, launching antitrust probes into American companies, and restricting Chinese airlines from taking deliveries of Boeing jets. These actions signal Beijing's intent to exert pressure on the US through non-tariff measures, creating different levels of pain for American companies.

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has canceled $2.7 million in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about anti-American and pro-Hamas ideology on campus. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has deemed the university "unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars" and is demanding records related to foreign visa-holding students. This action follows President Trump's decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard and request a review of its tax-exempt status. The move is part of a broader federal crackdown on campus antisemitism and concerns about institutional accountability.</p>

            <p>The UK's leading business groups are calling for urgent changes to the government's proposed Employment Rights Bill, warning that it could negatively impact economic growth. The bill aims to guarantee new rights for workers, including sick pay, protection from unfair dismissal, and restrictions on "fire-and-rehire" practices. However, business groups argue that the bill's current form could discourage hiring and reduce flexibility for employers and staff. The government maintains that the bill will deliver the "biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation," but the business community's concerns highlight potential challenges in balancing worker protections and economic competitiveness.</p>

            <p>Despite Elon Musk's initial intervention, the Trump administration has reportedly doubled down on its decision to halt emergency food shipments to millions of starving children in countries like Bangladesh and Somalia. Orders for therapeutic peanut paste, a lifesaving treatment for malnutrition, have been canceled, and contracts for shipping the food have not been awarded. The situation has left boxes of food stockpiled in warehouses, with concerns that many children will die without urgent intervention.

While acknowledging that awareness plays a role, he emphasized the need to investigate potential environmental exposures, such as mold, food, and pesticides. The announcement comes after a new report showed an increase in autism diagnoses, prompting a renewed focus on understanding the causes of the condition.</p>
