          <p>Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh has named quarterback Trey Lance as the starter for the upcoming NFL Hall of Fame preseason game against the Detroit Lions. Lance, a former third overall draft pick, is expected to play into the third quarter, providing him with significant game experience as he begins his tenure with the team. This decision aligns with the common practice of resting primary starters like Justin Herbert in the first exhibition game. The annual game in Canton, Ohio, offers an additional evaluation opportunity for the participating teams ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>A gunman identified as Shane Tamura, 27, killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The shooter used a high-powered rifle and left a note suggesting he believed he had CTE, a brain disease linked to head trauma, and appeared to blame the National Football League, which has offices in the building. The victims included officer Didarul Islam, a security guard, and employees of Blackstone and Rudin Management. The investigation revealed the shooter drove from Las Vegas and had a documented mental health history.</p>

          <p>The mass shooting in Manhattan, carried out by a Las Vegas resident, has raised questions about how the gunman acquired his weapons under Nevada's gun laws. The suspect, Shane Tamura, legally purchased a revolver and possessed a Nevada-issued concealed carry permit, though it is unclear how he obtained the M4-style rifle used in the attack. While Nevada is an open-carry state, it has implemented stricter laws since 2017, including universal background checks for private sales and a "red flag" law. However, unlike New York, it does not ban assault-style weapons, highlighting the regulatory differences between states.</p>

He called for Democrats to show more "backbone" and use their leverage to fight what he termed unconstitutional actions.

          <p>Data from Los Angeles County indicates that July is the deadliest month for drug overdoses, a trend some experts believe is linked to extreme heat. Researchers suggest that substances like opioids can impair the body's ability to regulate temperature, while sedating effects may prevent users from seeking shelter from the heat. Despite this evidence, official records often do not list heat as a contributing factor in overdose deaths, leading to probable undercounting. This discrepancy highlights a systemic issue in how deaths are certified, potentially hindering effective public health responses to the combined risks of heatwaves and substance use.</p>

The recent China-EU summit is cited as evidence, where the EU gained little beyond minor agreements, suggesting China no longer sees it as a serious partner.

          <h2>Twenty States Sue Trump Administration to Block Demand for SNAP Recipient Data</h2>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from collecting personal data on recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The states argue the demand is an overreach and fear the information, including immigration status and addresses, will be used for mass deportation efforts. The U.S. Department of Agriculture claims the data is needed to combat fraud, but has threatened to withhold funding from non-compliant states. Attorneys general leading the suit called the demand a "bait-and-switch" that violates the privacy of vulnerable families who provided information to receive food aid.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece critiques a new directive from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth that suspends Defense Department participation in conferences and activities hosted by think tanks. The author argues the policy stems from resentment, insecurity, and a fear of public dissent within an administration that punishes any deviation from the official line. The ban, which has affected events like the Aspen Security Forum, is seen as a way for unqualified officials to avoid scrutiny and embarrassment. The article warns that this intellectual lockdown will damage vital civil-military relationships and hinder the exchange of ideas necessary for national defense.</p>

          <p>Athleta has appointed Maggie Gauger, a 20-year Nike veteran who led its women's business in North America, as its new chief executive. This move is a significant win for the struggling Gap-owned athleisure brand and a notable loss for Nike, which has been focusing on growing its female customer base. Gauger is the third CEO for Athleta in two years, tasked with reinvigorating the brand after several quarters of declining sales. The leadership change underscores the intense competition in the women's activewear market and highlights the strategic importance of this demographic for major apparel companies.</p>

The family stated that they were unaware of the risks of swimming in the lake where their son was exposed and do not want his death to be in vain.

Chinese officials reportedly responded by asserting their energy sovereignty. Bessent also expressed U.S. displeasure with China's sales of dual-use technology to Russia, which he said is damaging China's reputation in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

This repeal would dismantle the basis for numerous Clean Air Act regulations, including emissions standards for vehicles and power plants.

Companies like Novartis and Roche, with significant overseas manufacturing, appear more exposed, while firms with larger U.S. production footprints, such as AbbVie and Eli Lilly, may be better positioned. The potential tariffs, which could be as high as 200%, are expected to pressure company cash flows and could lead to politically difficult price hikes or cuts in R&D spending.
