          <p>A strike by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union over pay and conditions has severely disrupted London's Underground services, forcing commuters to use alternative transport like bikes and buses. The union is demanding a shorter work week, which they argue is affordable given Transport for London's budget surplus, but TfL has called the demand "simply unaffordable." The industrial action has caused frustration among some public members due to significantly longer travel times, while officials including the Mayor of London have urged both sides to negotiate a resolution.</p>

This move highlights Nvidia's efforts to maintain a strong relationship with the administration as it seeks licenses to sell its advanced Blackwell chips in China. Huang has been actively engaging with Trump, arguing that allowing Nvidia's exports to China benefits U.S. national security by maintaining American leadership in the AI sector. The visit underscores the critical intersection of technology, international trade, and geopolitics for major U.S. corporations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Congress is considering legislation to create a national standard for how collegiate athletes can be compensated for their name, image, and likeness (NIL). Proponents, primarily Republicans, argue that a federal framework is needed to replace the current chaotic "Wild West" of varying state laws. However, the proposed House bill faces strong opposition from most Democrats and players' associations, who believe it infringes on athletes' rights to organize and negotiate as employees. The debate highlights a deep partisan divide on whether to regulate the burgeoning market or to grant student-athletes full labor rights.</p>

The crash occurred in an industrial area, ripping the bus apart upon impact.

Authorities are investigating the cause of the tragic incident, while the train line, Canadian Pacific Kansas City of Mexico, is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court dismissed Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he should have presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide grounds for reconsidering the immunity issue. The judges affirmed that the lower court's rulings were correct and the damages awarded were fair and reasonable. This decision relates to Trump's statements denying Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which saw minimal payroll growth and a rise in the unemployment rate, market traders are increasingly pricing in a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. While a 25-basis-point reduction is the most likely scenario, there is a growing, albeit small, possibility of a more aggressive 50-basis-point cut being considered. Economists are debating the Fed's next move as it balances the need to address labor market weakness against persistent inflation concerns. Upcoming inflation data will be a critical factor in the Federal Open Market Committee's decision-making process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The French government has been toppled after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a parliamentary confidence vote, forcing President Emmanuel Macron to find a fourth prime minister in the last year. Bayrou's government fell after he gambled on securing support for an unpopular budget focused on deep public spending cuts to address France's significant national debt. The ouster, driven by a coalition of left-wing and far-right lawmakers, plunges the nation into renewed political uncertainty. The crisis stems from Macron's 2024 decision to call a snap election that resulted in a hung parliament.</p>

The lawsuit argued the terminations were unlawful because the administration failed to provide the required 60-day notice for large-scale layoffs.

In response, the Department of Homeland Security announced an expanded immigration enforcement operation in the area called "Midway Blitz."

The article reflects on how these predictable victories against lesser opponents often fail to generate excitement or provide a true measure of the team's capabilities ahead of major tournaments. Memorable qualifiers, like David Beckham's 2001 free-kick against Greece, are rare exceptions. The analysis suggests that the prevalence of defensive tactics from underdog teams and England's possession-based style contribute to the lack of jeopardy and entertainment in these preliminary games.</p>

With a national debt of approximately €3.35 trillion (113% of GDP) and a high budget deficit, France faces pressure to implement drastic savings measures that are politically unpopular. Financial markets have reacted with higher risk premiums on French bonds, and analysts worry that continued political deadlock could hinder necessary economic reforms.

          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in history, totaling $1.787 billion, will be split between two winning tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. Each ticket holder can choose between a pretax lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million paid over 30 years. Both winners will face a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding on their prize. However, the Missouri winner will also be subject to state income taxes, potentially resulting in a significantly higher overall tax bill compared to the winner in Texas, which does not tax lottery winnings.</p>

          <p>Democratic senators on the Senate Banking Committee are demanding that Federal Reserve nominee Stephen Miran resign from his position as a White House economic adviser before they will advance his nomination. The lawmakers argue that Miran's plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisers while serving on the Fed board creates an unacceptable conflict of interest. They contend that holding both roles simultaneously would prevent him from exercising independent judgment on monetary policy, potentially violating the Federal Reserve Act's requirement that governors devote their "entire time" to the board's business.</p>

The decision puts a lower court's order to reinstate Slaughter on hold while the full Supreme Court considers the administration's request. Slaughter sued after being fired by President Trump, arguing her removal violated a law limiting a president's power to fire FTC commissioners. This case is part of a broader legal conflict over the president's authority to remove appointees from independent federal agencies without cause.</p>

The incident occurred as the players were celebrating a touchdown near the stands during their game against the Bills. Jackson admitted that he let his emotions get the best of him and should have allowed security to handle the situation. The fan was reportedly ejected from the stadium, and it remains unclear if Jackson will face any disciplinary action from the NFL for his involvement in the altercation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts advise that potential homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score, as a higher FICO score directly translates to a lower interest rate. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable lending terms and help avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

Bayrou's push for €44 billion in unpopular budget cuts to address France's massive public debt ultimately led to his downfall.
