          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, compounding a previous loss in the lower house. The defeat comes amid public discontent over inflation and political scandals, alongside the rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party. Despite the significant electoral blow, Ishiba has pledged to remain in his post to lead critical tariff negotiations with the United States. This marks the first time since its 1955 founding that the Liberal Democratic Party does not hold a majority in either house of parliament.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited notorious drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias to the U.S. to face charges of cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and firearms violations. Macias, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June following a high-profile escape from a maximum-security prison in January. His escape prompted Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens to a foreign country, signaling a significant step in the nation's fight against powerful drug cartels.</p>

          <p>Drake Bell, former star of the Nickelodeon show "Drake & Josh," has accused the network of failing to pay residuals to its child actors for shows that continue to air and stream widely. He claims that despite the enduring popularity of his sitcom, he and his co-stars do not receive ongoing compensation, while the parent company profits immensely. Bell contrasted this with industry standards at other networks and described the practice as exploitative, linking it to the broader emotional and mental strain placed on young performers in the industry.</p>

          <p>A significant divergence is emerging in the energy policies of China and the United States, particularly as global demand for electricity rises due to technologies like AI. While China is accelerating its investments in renewable energy to secure a technological and environmental lead, the Trump administration is actively canceling tax credits for wind and solar power. This contrast highlights the different strategic approaches the two global powers are taking to address climate change and future energy needs, with Beijing forging ahead in the green energy race.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is shutting down the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), its primary scientific research arm. The move is part of a broader plan to cut the EPA's staff by 23% and is framed by the administration as a way to streamline operations and focus on the agency's core mission. Critics, including congressional Democrats and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing that it will severely impair the EPA's ability to use science to protect human health and the environment.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert, the single most important skill to teach a child for a successful life is 'self-connection'—the ability to tune into their own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and develops authentic confidence from within. The author provides parents with practical strategies, such as validating feelings instead of dismissing them and modeling emotional self-regulation, to help children build a strong sense of self-worth that will support their mental health into adulthood.</p>

This creates an environment of uncertainty and forces US businesses to walk a tightrope as they try to maintain their presence in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of plea deals for the accused 9/11 orchestrators has thrown the long-delayed case into further uncertainty. The deals would have allowed the defendants to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, avoiding a death penalty trial. According to Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck, this reversal not only removes a path to closure but will also trigger more litigation over the decision itself, likely adding years of delays to a legal process that has already spanned more than two decades.</p>

The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, causing a fatal medical episode. This event serves as a stark reminder of the safety protocols required around MRI equipment.</p>
