Postecoglou was recently sacked by Tottenham despite leading them to a Europa League victory, a move that surprised many in the football community. The potential appointment has generated mixed reactions among Forest fans, with some questioning his defensive tactics while others hope he can build on the club's recent successes. The club aims to finalize the appointment before their upcoming match against Arsenal.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike has killed more than twenty people in the village of Yarova in eastern Ukraine, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The victims were reportedly civilians who were gathered to collect their pensions at the time of the attack. This incident marks one of the deadliest assaults on civilians in recent weeks, occurring as Russian forces continue their slow advance in the Donetsk region. President Zelensky condemned the strike as a brutal act and called for a stronger international response to Russia's aggression.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch family has concluded, with a deal that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the media empire. The agreement ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's passing. Under the terms, Lachlan's siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of the trust holding company shares, receiving a cash buyout of approximately $1.1 billion each. This resolution effectively ends litigation over the family trust and removes the influence of the more politically moderate siblings.</p>

          <p>Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, discusses the challenges facing American higher education and the notable surge in applications to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). She suggests that in an era of political attacks on diversity initiatives, Black students are increasingly seeking affirming environments where their history is valued rather than erased. Dr. Tatum also addresses the weaponization of issues like antisemitism and the pushback against DEI programs, framing it as a predictable backlash to racial progress. While HBCUs offer a refuge, they still face significant financial challenges in meeting student needs.</p>

          <p>A country music radio station in Fort Myers, Florida, has rebranded itself as "Trump Country 93.7 FM," using President Trump's name, image, and a voice impersonator without official permission.

The station's promotions include controversial content, such as a "Deportation a day" campaign that mockingly offers cruises to Mexico.

          <p>Recent cuts to Medicaid enacted under President Trump, aimed at reducing fraud and promoting work among adults, are projected to have severe side effects for children's healthcare. According to the Children's Hospital Association, pediatric hospitals could lose billions in revenue, as nearly half of all Medicaid enrollees are children. The law reduces federal Medicaid spending by $900 billion over a decade and caps supplemental payments that hospitals rely on to offset low reimbursement rates. Hospital officials warn that without this funding, they may be forced to cut essential services and staff, disproportionately affecting vulnerable young patients.</p>

          <p>At a virtual BRICS summit, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar urged fellow member nations—Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa—to address their significant trade imbalances with New Delhi. The call came as the bloc presented a united front against U.S. tariffs, which have impacted several of their economies. India's trade deficit with China has reached a record high, and its deficit with Russia has also grown substantially due to increased oil imports. The statement highlights India's focus on the economic aspects of the BRICS partnership, seeking more balanced trade flows.</p>

          <p>Serbian riot police used tear gas, stun grenades, and batons to disperse a peaceful protest at the University of Novi Sad, leading to widespread condemnation. The demonstration was met with what observers described as excessive and indiscriminate force, with police charging and beating students, professors, and bystanders. President Aleksandar Vucic defended the police action as a "professionally executed job," accusing the demonstrators of being "cowards" who attacked first. Critics argue the crackdown is a sign of the government's shift toward open repression and an attempt to intimidate and silence dissent against the regime.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a U.S. judge decided against breaking up Google, citing the rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence as a potential game-changer in the search market. While the court found that Google illegally monopolized the search market, Judge Amit Mehta's penalty was limited, requiring the company to share some information with rivals. The judge argued that AI-powered chatbots from competitors like OpenAI could significantly disrupt Google's dominance, a "new reality" that influenced his decision to avoid more drastic structural remedies like selling off the Chrome browser.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has personally supervised the final ground test of a new high-thrust, solid-fuel engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), according to state media. This development is a significant concern for international security, as solid-fuel missiles can be deployed much faster and are harder to detect before launch than their liquid-fuel counterparts. Analysts believe the successful completion of this test phase means North Korea is now prepared for a full test launch of the new ICBM, potentially before the end of the year, further advancing its strategic nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated she is "really worried" the country might need a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), similar to the 1976 crisis. She argued that without a credible plan for economic growth from the Labour government, the UK could find itself in a "doom loop" of rising taxes and unstable public finances. Badenoch pointed to rising government bond yields as a worrying indicator and offered to work with the government on cutting welfare spending. A Labour source dismissed her comments, blaming the previous Conservative government for having "crashed the economy."</p>
