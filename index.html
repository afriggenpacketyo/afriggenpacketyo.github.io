          <p>President Trump has announced that a 50% tariff on copper imports will take effect on August 1, following a national security assessment that deemed the metal critical for defense and technology. The move has caused copper prices to surge and is expected to create a significant price disparity between the U.S. and global markets. Analysts warn this could lead to higher consumer costs for goods like cars and appliances, and potentially slow down infrastructure projects, impacting employment. The administration's goal is to increase domestic copper production, though experts believe this will take a considerable amount of time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the interim administrator of NASA, highlighting the increasing importance of space in national priorities. Duffy, a former congressman and longtime Trump ally, will temporarily lead the space agency, a role previously held by acting administrator Janet Petro. The appointment follows the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman's nomination for the permanent role in May, which was reportedly due to concerns over his ties to Elon Musk and potential conflicts of interest with SpaceX.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its key interest rate steady at 2.5%, an almost three-year low, amid signs of a contracting economy and concerns over financial stability. The decision comes as housing prices in Seoul have spiked and household loan growth has accelerated, prompting new mortgage lending restrictions. Analysts suggest these measures could pave the way for a rate cut in August. The South Korean economy also faces potential headwinds from threatened U.S. tariffs if a trade deal is not reached with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, escalating a trade and political dispute with the South American nation. In a letter, Trump cited a "witch hunt" against former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing prosecution for an alleged coup plot, and accused Brazil of unfair digital trade practices. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that any unilateral tariff increase would be met with reciprocal measures and warned against interference in Brazil's judicial system, underscoring the growing diplomatic friction between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California, while improving, remains nearly a year lower than it was in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. While the virus was the primary driver of the initial drop, the slower-than-expected recovery is now attributed mainly to drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The research highlights significant disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower rebound in life expectancy compared to white and Asian residents.

          <p>The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing that the state's stringent animal cruelty laws for egg-laying hens are unconstitutional and contribute to high egg prices nationwide. The suit claims that California's requirements, which mandate cage-free systems and more space for hens, are preempted by federal law and constitute "unnecessary red tape." Supporters of the laws argue they are crucial for preventing animal cruelty and reducing food safety risks.

          <p>Russia has launched its most extensive drone attack on Ukraine in a single day, firing over 700 Shahed and decoy drones along with 13 missiles overnight. Ukrainian officials reported at least eight civilian deaths from strikes that hit vehicles in the eastern part of the country. The massive assault occurred just after President Trump pledged more weapons for Ukraine and issued direct criticism of Vladimir Putin, stating he was "not happy" with the Russian leader. The Kremlin responded to Trump's comments by saying it was "quite calm" about his mounting criticism.</p>
