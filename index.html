          <p>Boeing has reached a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, allowing the company to avoid criminal charges related to the two 737 Max crashes that resulted in 346 deaths. The agreement requires Boeing to pay over $1.1 billion, including a criminal fine, compensation for crash victims' families, and investments in compliance and safety programs. While this deal shields Boeing from a trial, families of the victims have criticized it as lenient, advocating for greater accountability and the prosecution of company executives. The crashes, involving Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights, led to a nearly two-year grounding of the 737 Max aircraft worldwide.</p>

          <p>The CDC has reported cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a significant surge of the virus in China. The variant has been found in international travelers arriving at airports in multiple states, as well as in other states separate from the airport cases. While Hong Kong authorities say there is no evidence that the variant is more severe, they have urged residents to mask in public. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 has a greater ability to bind to human cells, potentially increasing its transmissibility. The FDA's vaccine advisers discussed whether to update COVID-19 vaccines for the coming seasons, with early data suggesting that a vaccine targeting the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 could boost protection against NB.1.8.1.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he is recommending a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, effective June 1, citing stalled trade negotiations and unfair trade practices. Trump stated he is "not looking for a deal" and that the tariff is a response to the EU's trade barriers, VAT taxes, and lawsuits against American companies. The announcement caused immediate reactions in the financial markets, with U.S. stock futures and European stock markets declining. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope that the tariff threat would prompt the EU to negotiate more seriously. The EU was the second-largest purchaser of U.S. exports in 2022, importing nearly $351 billion in American goods.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily blocked lower court orders that mandated the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to hand over information to a government watchdog group. This action is part of a lawsuit examining whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force must comply with federal public records law. The temporary stay allows the Supreme Court additional time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief. The dispute originated from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), seeking details about DOGE's operations and personnel. The district court had previously granted CREW's request, asserting that DOGE likely falls under FOIA regulations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investing in gold can be a prudent strategy, especially amidst economic uncertainty, but beginners should consider several factors before diving in. Physical gold carries storage and premium costs, making gold ETFs a more efficient entry point for new investors. While gold is considered a safe-haven asset, its price is influenced by various factors, making it essential to view it as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit opportunity. Investors should be cautious of scams and high premiums, opting for reputable dealers or well-known ETF platforms with low expense ratios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a month-long trial in Paris, eight of the ten individuals accused of robbing Kim Kardashian of millions of dollars' worth of jewelry in 2016 have been convicted. The robbers, known as the "Grandpa robbers" due to their advanced age, received sentences ranging from three to eight years, but most were suspended due to the defendants' ages and health issues, meaning they will not return to prison. During the trial, Kardashian testified that she feared for her life during the armed robbery, where she was bound and gagged. Kardashian expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice, stating the crime was the most terrifying experience of her life, leaving a lasting impact on her and her family.</p>

          <p>The ETF market is expected to experience a surge in new product launches due to a change from the SEC allowing mutual fund managers to offer an ETF share class of their existing funds. This could lead to a doubling of the number of ETFs available, creating a challenge for investors to navigate the expanded landscape. While many of the new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, there are concerns about the history of active managers struggling to beat the index. Investors should be cautious about new, straight-to-ETF strategies, particularly those involving illiquid securities, and consider whether the ETF structure is the right fit for the investment idea.</p>

While he believes Israel has a right to exist, he carefully avoided stating whether it should exist as a Jewish state. Mamdani's stance has drawn criticism, especially after a social media clip surfaced showing him leading a "BDS" chant at an anti-Israel protest.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's decision to block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accuses the administration of a "campaign of retribution" and a violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights. A federal judge in Boston swiftly issued a temporary restraining order against the ban, agreeing that it would cause "immediate and irreparable injury" to the university. The administration's action stems from allegations that Harvard has not adequately addressed antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison has agreed to pay $82.5 million to cover costs and damages from the 2020 Bobcat fire, marking a record settlement for one of the largest blazes in Los Angeles County. Federal officials allege that the fire was ignited when trees, not properly maintained by Edison and its contractor, came into contact with power lines. The settlement comes as Edison seeks to raise customer rates to fund wildfire mitigation efforts and cover operational costs. The federal government had filed a lawsuit seeking damages in excess of $121 million for the cost of extinguishing the fire and resulting damage.</p>

Concerns have been raised about potential violations of laws requiring the government to report statistics that a canceled survey would produce.

The article highlights instances such as the platform's chatbot promoting white-supremacist talking points and the prevalence of anti-Semitic content. While some users may simply be using X for sports, news, or memes, the article argues that the platform has become an accelerator for a culture of hate, raising ethical questions about continued participation.

The legislation sets aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for families to use for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning, potentially benefiting religious education. While voucher advocates once focused on low-income students, they are now pushing for vouchers for most everyone, backed by powerful conservative donors.

          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill includes new tax rules that could significantly impact workers who earn tips or overtime pay. The bill aims to eliminate taxes on tipped income for those earning less than $160,000 annually, potentially saving each tipped worker around $1,700. It also offers a tax break for workers who receive overtime pay. However, some experts caution that the benefits may be limited, as many low-income tipped workers pay no federal income tax.
