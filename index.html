          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been moved from the intensive care unit to a rehabilitation facility over three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home. The attack also wounded his wife, Yvette, and is believed to be linked to the fatal shooting of state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband on the same night. The suspect, Vance Boelter, faces multiple federal and state charges for what officials have described as politically motivated attacks against several elected officials. Boelter was taken into custody and is facing charges that could result in the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes, a change being rolled out at major U.S. airports. The rule, implemented nationwide in 2006, was a response to the 2001 "shoe bomber" attempt. According to a memo, the goal is to expedite security screening, though passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove footwear for additional checks. This policy shift brings the standard screening process more in line with the expedited TSA PreCheck program, aiming to improve the passenger experience.</p>

          <p>Police in Philadelphia are searching for three suspects after a mass shooting in the Grays Ferry neighborhood left three men dead and nine others, including two juveniles, injured. The incident occurred early Monday morning, and authorities have recovered nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence, believing a weapon modified for automatic fire was used. This shooting was part of a violent holiday weekend in the city, though officials noted that overall homicide and shooting rates for the year remain down compared to the previous year. Community leaders expressed heartbreak over the violence impacting local youth.</p>

          <p>Two teenage camp counselors from Mexico, Silvana Garza Valdez and María Paula Zárate, described their efforts to protect young campers at Camp Mystic during the deadly Texas floods. They recalled keeping the girls calm with songs and games as floodwaters rose, eventually preparing them for evacuation by writing their names on their skin for identification. The counselors were initially unaware of the fatalities but understood the gravity of the situation upon seeing helicopter evacuations. Their account provides a personal perspective on the chaos and tragedy that claimed the lives of 27 campers and staff at their camp.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian aggression. This decision comes just days after the White House confirmed a temporary halt on some weapon shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The President stated the weapons are necessary because Ukraine is being "hit very hard" and emphasized that the shipments will be primarily defensive. The announcement followed recent phone calls between Trump and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia, with Trump expressing disappointment in his conversation with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Singapore is emerging as an increasingly popular choice for Chinese students pursuing higher education, as the appeal of studying in the United States wanes. Factors such as cultural similarities, safety concerns, and a welcoming environment are drawing students like Miya Zheng to reconsider their plans. Industry insiders suggest that while the U.S. has historically been the top destination, growing instability and cultural adjustment difficulties are causing a shift. Singapore's top universities are expected to see a rise in applications from Chinese students seeking a high-quality international education in a more familiar setting.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that one in five vehicle accidents in the U.S. occurs in parking lots, resulting in over 500 deaths and 165 injuries daily. The study identifies cities like San Bernardino, California, where parking lots comprise nearly half the downtown area, as concrete danger zones due to poor design and lack of regulation. Common issues include inadequate lighting, faded markings, and unmarked pedestrian crossings, compounded by high rates of driver distraction from activities like phone calls and texting. The report suggests safety improvements for cities and drivers, such as better design, enhanced maintenance, and more attentive driving habits.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers endured a 9-1 defeat against the Milwaukee Brewers, largely due to a catastrophic first inning from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. In the shortest start of his MLB career, Yamamoto gave up five runs on 41 pitches before being pulled with only two outs recorded. The inning was marred by a three-run homer, poor defense including a critical error by Mookie Betts, and an inability to regain rhythm.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." An amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will prevent such evictions unless a landlord obtains a formal Government Agency Order requiring the unit to be vacated for safety reasons. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenant protection during legitimate renovations, including provisions for relocation assistance and the right to return at a legally capped rent increase. This action aims to close a loophole that tenant advocates say has been used to unfairly displace renters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas that killed over 100 people were caused by a confluence of geographical and meteorological factors. The region's terrain is naturally prone to rapid runoff, and a stalled weather system, fueled by moisture from a tropical system, dumped extreme amounts of rain in a short period. The Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes while many were asleep during the holiday weekend. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the lack of a robust local warning system and the timeliness of alerts, with survivors reporting they received no warning before the deluge hit their campgrounds and homes.</p>

          <h2>Department of Veterans Affairs Cancels Plan for Large-Scale Layoffs</h2>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs. The agency announced that it is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, making mass layoffs unnecessary. The initial plan considered cutting the workforce by up to 15%, or over 80,000 jobs, to return to 2019 staffing levels. Critics, however, argue the significant staff reduction is due to a "toxic work environment" and will negatively impact veteran care.</p>

          <p>China has activated another branch of the M503 flight path in the Taiwan Strait, a move made without consulting Taipei that has raised alarms in Taiwan. The new route, W121, is one of three offshoots from the main north-south path and at its closest point lies just 4.2 nautical miles from the strait's unofficial median line. Beijing's civil aviation authority stated the change was a technical adjustment to ease air traffic and improve safety. However, the unilateral action is viewed by Taipei as a potentially destabilizing move in the sensitive region, continuing a pattern of increasing pressure on the island.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that investigators found no evidence of a so-called "client list" used for blackmailing prominent individuals. The findings, detailed in a memo, aimed to address widespread conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody and his sex trafficking case. The review confirmed that video footage showed no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death. Officials stated that while Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the cause of justice for them.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a surprise to Kershaw, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. The 37-year-old future Hall of Famer expressed gratitude for the honor, describing it as "weird but cool." While his workload has been limited, he has maintained a solid 3.43 ERA and recently achieved his 3,000th career strikeout, adding another milestone to his celebrated career.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a $2.2 billion plan to purchase an additional 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones in the war in Ukraine, as well as a significant increase in the aircraft's cost. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the country must invest in capabilities that reflect the future of warfare, such as drones and smart systems, rather than expensive legacy platforms. This move signals a potential strategic shift in military procurement, prioritizing survivability and adaptability on the modern battlefield.</p>

The decision provides relief to thousands of participants who faced potential fines. Organizers, including Budapest's liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, had declared the march an official municipal event to circumvent the ban, a move that put them at risk of prison time.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targets groups providing abortion services. While federal funds cannot be used for most abortions, Planned Parenthood argued the new law would devastate its ability to provide other essential health services, like cancer screenings, to its many Medicaid patients. The judge's 14-day order ensures funding continues while the court considers the full case, which Planned Parenthood calls a defense against an unconstitutional attack.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly floods in Texas that claimed over 100 lives, questions are being raised about the adequacy of emergency alerts and the impact of federal budget cuts. Local officials in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, noted the lack of a robust flood warning siren system, a project that had been discussed but not funded. The National Weather Service issued multiple warnings, but some residents received no alerts or have become desensitized to them. Concerns have also surfaced about staffing levels at NWS offices, though meteorologists defend the accuracy of their forecasts, pointing to the storm's extreme and unprecedented nature.</p>
