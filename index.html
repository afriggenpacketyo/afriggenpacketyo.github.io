          <p>U.S. officials have stated that Hamas's response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire agreement is a setback, particularly regarding guarantees for a permanent end to the war, which has been a key point of contention with Israel. The U.S. envoy for the Middle East described Hamas's response as "totally unacceptable and only takes us backward." Hamas has reiterated demands for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a permanent truce, and assurances of continuous humanitarian aid, which are not currently part of the proposed deal. The U.S. is urging Hamas to accept the original framework for immediate proximity talks to close a 60-day cease-fire deal.</p>

          <p>A British man, John Miller, has been indicted along with Cui Guanghai of China for allegedly attempting to smuggle U.S. military technology to China and organizing the stalking and harassment of a critic of Beijing.

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, warns that China's quantum satellite, Micius, is potentially vulnerable to hacking due to minor delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers, compromising the satellite's performance, which is crucial for expanding China's quantum communication network. Miller analyzed data from communications between a ground station and Micius, discovering time delays in the quantum transmitter's lasers. Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data, theoretically making it unhackable, but flaws in implementation can create vulnerabilities.</p>

The U.S. envoy for the Middle East has deemed the response "totally unacceptable," while Israel has stated that Hamas continues to adhere to its refusal to accept the updated framework.

The IAEA report sternly warns that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, prompting calls for urgent cooperation and compliance with the agency's probe.

The approval is based on a study comparing mNexspike to Moderna's existing vaccine, demonstrating its safety and effectiveness.
