          <p>The owner of a paddleboard company has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison following the deaths of four individuals on a river in Wales in October 2021. Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a former police officer, admitted to gross negligence manslaughter after leading a tour in hazardous conditions without proper qualifications. The court found that Lloyd disregarded safety protocols, leading the group over a dangerous weir. The victims, including Paul O'Dwyer, Morgan Rogers, Nicola Wheatley, and Andrea Powell, tragically lost their lives due to the negligence and lack of safety measures during the paddleboarding excursion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports, potentially lowering them to a range of 50% to 65%. This move comes as part of a broader recalibration of trade strategy, following earlier increases to 145% tariffs. The report of potential tariff reductions has spurred a rally in U.S. equity markets. The administration is also reviewing a tiered system that would differentiate between strategic and non-strategic goods, potentially phasing in the new structure over five years.</p>

          <p>International tourism to the United States is experiencing a slump, while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas. Foreign visitors arriving by air fell nearly 10% in March compared to the previous year. This imbalance is widening the gap between what the U.S. generates through travel and tourism services and what Americans spend abroad. Factors contributing to the decline include trade tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar. The U.S. travel industry is concerned about the trend and its potential impact on the economy.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the increasing prevalence of legislation that treats fetuses as people, potentially subjecting women who have abortions to homicide charges. Mary Ziegler, a legal scholar, argues that the anti-abortion movement has always been a fetal-personhood movement, increasingly emboldened since the overturning of Roe v Wade. The article explores the movement's historical trajectory, its alliance with the Republican party, and the rise of "abortion abolitionists." While these extreme views are not widely popular, the movement's focus on influencing the courts allows it to disregard public opinion.</p>
