          <h2>US Offers Iran a Nuclear Deal Proposal After IAEA Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 21:06:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear agreement, confirmed by the White House after a UN nuclear watchdog report indicated Iran had increased its enriched uranium production. The proposal, delivered by US President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, is under consideration by Iranian officials, who stated they will respond in line with their principles and national interests. The IAEA report revealed Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, nearing weapons-grade level, prompting concerns from the US, Britain, France, and Germany. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, dismissing the IAEA report as politically motivated. Optimism around the situation is tempered by the complexity of international negotiations.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September while facing a mass-recall campaign initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The recall campaign threatens the KMT's legislative majority and could disrupt the leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has expressed his intention to step down after completing his term, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor. The KMT plans to announce the party chair race in July and install a new leader by October, hoping to regain power after years on the political sidelines. The party's ability to navigate the recall challenge will significantly impact its future.</p>

          <p>Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the UN nuclear watchdog. The report states that as of May 17, Iran possesses 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February. The IAEA has warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, raising serious concerns. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the U.S. has sent a "detailed and acceptable proposal" to Iran through special envoy Steve Witkoff, emphasizing that Iran must never obtain a nuclear bomb.</p>

The crash caused both vehicles to burst into flames, killing Moreno and six passengers from China, Italy, and California; survivors were hospitalized with injuries. Police Capt.

          <p>A new TikTok trend suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" consisting of full-fat coke and salty fries can alleviate migraine symptoms, but experts caution against its effectiveness as a universal cure. While some individuals find relief from the caffeine and sugar in coke or the salt in fries, migraines are complex neurological conditions that cannot be cured by fast food. Dr. Kay Kennis, a GP specializing in migraines, notes that caffeine can disrupt nerve activity, but too much can also trigger migraines. Neurologist Prof Peter Goadsby emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes and listening to one's body over relying on social media trends.</p>

          <p>According to Ross Douthat, Donald Trump's political resilience hinges on his ability to adapt, backtrack, and contradict himself. This willingness to swerve and backpedal reassures swing voters that extreme actions are provisional and that Trump is willing to pull back. Trump's recent adjustments, such as easing China tariffs and distancing himself from Elon Musk, have improved his poll numbers. Seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned of an "imminent" threat from China to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war.

China responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, citing US military activities in the South China Sea. The US aims to create a "strong shield of deterrence" with allies to prevent war, but emphasizes that deterrence requires increased defense spending from Asian countries.</p>

          <p>The UK government will invest £1.5bn in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. This initiative is part of the government's strategic defense review and aims to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up. The UK will also purchase over 7,000 British-built long-range weapons, including drones and missiles, over several years. Ministers state that this investment will strengthen the armed forces, boost the economy, and provide security for working people in an uncertain world.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has launched a multi-pronged attack on Harvard University, including threatening to redirect research funding and suspending foreign students, impacting American higher education. Students at Harvard have expressed concern over the administration's actions, which are perceived as a threat to academic freedom. Trump's actions are viewed by some as an attempt to erode traditional pillars of support for the Democratic Party and reshape universities in a more conservative-friendly image. While Harvard is resisting, the potential for long-term transformation depends on whether other universities accommodate the administration's demands.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for various sectors. The level of spending on health will determine whether cuts are made to other areas outside of the NHS, defense, and schools. Increased funding in 2024 for transport, net zero, hospitals, schools, and prisons will not continue year on year, given the government's commitments. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's stance on not borrowing more money or raising taxes again has led to speculation about spending cuts. The government will scrutinize every pound spent.</p>
