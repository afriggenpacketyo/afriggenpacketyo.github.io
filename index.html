          <p>Venture capitalist Peter Thiel's firm, Founders Fund, has acquired a 9% stake in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy. This disclosure led to a significant surge in Bitmine's stock, with shares climbing as much as 29%. The investment has also positively impacted other companies in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital, which saw their own stock prices rise. This trend reflects growing investor interest in Ethereum-related assets, bolstered by recent developments like Robinhood's expansion of tokenized stock trading in Europe and progress on stablecoin legislation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, just hours after reports emerged that he had discussed the possibility with Republican lawmakers. The initial reports caused temporary dips in stock markets and the dollar, highlighting concerns over the potential dismissal of a Fed chair, a move that would break with historical precedent. Trump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, continuing his attacks by calling him a "knucklehead." Despite acknowledging the discussions, the president downplayed any immediate plans for removal, suggesting it would only happen in a case of serious misconduct. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines has issued a revised earnings forecast for 2025, now expecting adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share, aligning with analyst expectations. This update comes after the airline's second-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, signaling a recovery in travel demand after a slow start to the year. CEO Scott Kirby expressed confidence in a strong finish to 2025, stating the world feels "less uncertain." The airline's performance was slightly hampered by operational issues at its Newark hub, but the overall outlook suggests a stabilizing environment for the travel industry.</p>

The renewed momentum came after President Trump indicated that several Republican lawmakers had reversed their opposition following a White House meeting. This legislative progress has injected optimism into the market, boosting shares of related companies like Circle and Coinbase, and further fueling the recent surge in ether-related stocks.

          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by four wickets in the first one-day international match in Southampton. Chasing a target of 259 runs, India was guided to victory by all-rounder Deepti Sharma's crucial unbeaten score of 62. Despite a late-game effort from England that created some tension, India successfully reached their target with 10 balls remaining. For England, the loss highlighted issues with their fielding and a failure to capitalize on a strong batting performance from Sophia Dunkley, who scored 83 runs. The result is significant as both teams prepare for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao is set to return to the ring at age 46 to challenge the 30-year-old welterweight champion, Mario Barrios. The fight marks Pacquiao's first competitive bout in four years, following his 2021 loss to Yordenis Ugás. Despite the long layoff and significant age difference, Pacquiao claims his passion and disciplined training will lead him to victory. If he wins, he would make history as one of the oldest boxing champions ever and the only active fighter in the Hall of Fame to hold a title, adding another remarkable achievement to his eight-division championship career.</p>

          <h2>Rising Inflation May Keep Credit Card Interest Rates at Elevated Levels</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent uptick in the U.S. inflation rate, which rose to 2.7% annually in June, is creating pressure that could keep consumer borrowing costs high. While the Federal Reserve is expected to hold its key interest rate steady in the short term, persistent inflation could force it to maintain a tight monetary policy. Because most credit card annual percentage rates (APRs) are variable and tied to the Fed's benchmark rate, consumers are likely to continue facing high interest charges on their balances. For Americans carrying credit card debt, this economic environment makes it more difficult and expensive to pay down what they owe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in several years, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has begun transferring inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), despite local sanctuary policies. Records show that 20 inmates were handed over to federal immigration authorities in May and June 2025. According to the department, these transfers were lawful as they were executed in response to federal judicial warrants, which are an exception under state and local sanctuary laws. The resumption of these transfers marks a tactical shift in federal immigration enforcement within a region that has aimed to limit cooperation with ICE.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced legislation aimed at increasing transparency and imposing restrictions on donations to presidential libraries. The move follows several large, controversial contributions to Donald Trump's future library from corporations like Paramount and Disney, which were part of legal settlements. The proposed Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act would cap contributions, prohibit donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and require public disclosure. Proponents argue the bill is necessary to close loopholes that could allow such donations to be used as a tool for currying political favor or bribery.</p>

These fraudulent reports were then used to apply for U visas, which are reserved for victims of certain crimes who assist law enforcement. The officials allegedly received payments for creating the false documents. The scheme involved hundreds of names, creating the appearance of an unusually high number of robberies in the area.</p>

Meanwhile, the parties in the current ruling coalition continue to struggle, with the Social Democrats (SPD) at 14% and the Greens at 11%.

He emphasized the shared interest in reliable trade and international law as a basis for renewed cooperation.

          <p>The system of staggering summer vacation start times across Germany's 16 federal states is a source of annual political friction. While designed to prevent nationwide travel chaos, the schedule consistently benefits the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, which always get the desirable later holiday slots. Other states argue this is unfair, as their residents are often forced to travel during peak, more expensive periods. The southern states refuse to join the rotating schedule, citing tradition and the timing of their Pentecost holidays.

The survey, which included about 130 large US corporations, found that while leaving China is not a viable option for most, fewer than half are optimistic about the future.

New York officials accuse Tesla of a "bait-and-switch," arguing the company implemented the restrictive bylaw shortly after shareholders approved its reincorporation from Delaware to Texas, based on assurances that their rights would remain equivalent.
