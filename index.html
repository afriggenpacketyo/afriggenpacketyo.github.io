          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace secured a $96 billion agreement with Qatar Airways for up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody and 787 order. The deal, which includes 787 Dreamliners and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, was finalized during President Donald Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates the agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs during production and delivery. This deal could significantly boost Boeing's financial recovery after recent losses due to safety concerns and trade disruptions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to lower prescription drug prices have reignited the debate over the high costs faced by U.S. patients. A RAND Corporation report found that drug prices in the U.S. are almost three times higher than in other high-income countries, due to a complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. While Americans pay more for branded drugs, unbranded generics are often cheaper. The article also mentions a clampdown on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) as a potential cost-saving measure.</p>
