          <h2>China's Economic 'Involution' Problem Stems from Both Supply and Demand Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 19:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is facing an economic problem known as 'involution,' where intense internal competition leads to diminishing returns and stagnation. This issue is driven not only by oversupply, as local governments offer excessive incentives creating hyper-competitive markets, but also by insufficient demand. With profit margins approaching zero, businesses lack the resources for new investments, trapping them in a self-defeating cycle. The article argues that this phenomenon is a symptom of deeper structural issues, as both local governments and enterprises feel they have no other viable options but to engage in this excessive competition.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House, former President Donald Trump announced he has initiated arrangements for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. The goal is to facilitate direct negotiations to end the nearly four-year-long war, with Trump intending to join for trilateral talks afterward. This development represents a potential, albeit early, step toward a diplomatic resolution after previous attempts to bring the two leaders together were unsuccessful. The Kremlin acknowledged the call but did not confirm a direct Putin-Zelenskyy meeting.</p>

          <p>A second airman from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming has been charged with involuntary manslaughter within a month following a fatal shooting. Airman First Class Jadan Orr, 20, allegedly shot and killed a 23-year-old man in a Cheyenne apartment after handling an AK-47 rifle while drinking with friends. This incident follows the August arrest of another airman from the same base in connection with a separate shooting death in July. The earlier shooting led the Air Force Global Strike Command to suspend the use of the Sig Sauer M18 handgun amid concerns about its safety.</p>

          <p>Leeds United celebrated their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory over Everton, driven by a contentious late penalty converted by Lukas Nmecha. The match at Elland Road was marked by an intense and hostile atmosphere, which Leeds leveraged to dominate the first half, though without scoring. Everton, described as passive and panicky, offered little threat throughout the game. The win provides a crucial surge of belief for Leeds, making them one of two newly-promoted sides to win their opening game, a rare feat in Premier League history.</p>

This sentiment is shared by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who also advocates for hosting the game to solidify London's status as a global sports capital. The NFL has held regular-season games in London since 2007, but the Super Bowl has never been played outside of the United States.</p>

He stated that an executive order is being drafted to bar states from using these methods, which he claims without evidence are corrupt and unreliable. However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate state-run elections, a power granted to Congress.

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that women in Afghanistan are effectively trapped in the country's largest women's mental health facility due to a combination of societal restrictions and family abandonment. Many patients, some of whom are victims of domestic violence, are medically ready for discharge but have nowhere to go, as strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions prevent them from living independently. The center is overcrowded, with a growing waiting list, reflecting a worsening mental health crisis among Afghan women since the Taliban's takeover.

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic examines the escalating militarization of Washington, D.C., one week after former President Trump initiated a federal takeover of the city's policing. With National Guard troops from several Republican-led states being deployed, the stated mission to 'liberate' the city from crime lacks a clear objective or endpoint, raising concerns about an indefinite occupation. The article notes that federal forces are not primarily in high-crime areas, and immigration arrests have increased sharply. This action in D.C. is viewed as a potential experiment for similar takeovers in other Democrat-run cities, testing the legal and constitutional limits of presidential power.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill requiring mortgage lenders to pay homeowners at least 2% interest on insurance payouts held in escrow accounts following natural disasters. Previously, lenders could deposit these funds, intended for rebuilding, into an account and keep the accrued interest, which could be significant over the months or years it takes to rebuild. The new legislation, authored by Assemblymember John Harabedian and sponsored by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to close this loophole and provide additional financial support to homeowners during their recovery process.

          <p>A new study from Bankrate indicates that despite wage increases, the average American worker's pay has lagged behind the rise in the cost of living by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years. This gap signifies a loss of purchasing power for many households, contributing to widespread dissatisfaction with the economy. The analysis found that educators have experienced the largest disparity between income growth and inflation. In contrast, professions in high-demand sectors like leisure, hospitality, and healthcare have seen wage growth that outpaced the rate of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The union representing 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants is continuing its strike despite the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) declaring the job action illegal and ordering employees back to work. The strike, now in its third day, has disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers during the peak summer season. The union president stated they are willing to face penalties, including jail time, and will only resolve the dispute through a negotiated settlement. The conflict centers on demands for higher pay and compensation for time spent on the ground, which the union argues the airline's latest offer fails to adequately address.</p>

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about significant and disruptive federal immigration raids that occurred over the weekend. The city has experienced increased enforcement activity since a judge blocked agents from using racial profiling for random arrests in July. Recent incidents included agents detaining a bystander at a car wash and several laborers outside a Home Depot. Local officials condemned the federal actions, stating they spread fear, destabilize the community, and do not enhance public safety, affecting citizens and non-citizens alike.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a framework that would involve Hamas releasing about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for an initial 60-day truce, during which negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would occur. It remains uncertain how Israel will respond, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously stated that all hostages must be released at once. The development comes as the Israeli military intensifies its operations in Gaza City.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article examines whether debt from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay can be included in debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans are technically eligible for settlement, similar to credit card debt. However, because the industry is relatively new, not all providers may be willing to negotiate, and debt relief companies may lack established relationships with them. The article suggests that while debt forgiveness is a possibility, consumers struggling with BNPL payments should also consider direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling as alternative strategies.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Polari Prize, an award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following a controversy surrounding longlisted author John Boyne. Several other nominated authors withdrew from consideration to protest Boyne's inclusion, citing an article he wrote defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues. An open letter signed by over 800 publishing figures also criticized his nomination. In response to the backlash, organizers decided to pause the prize for the year to review their processes and increase the representation of trans and gender non-conforming judges, with hopes of returning in 2026.</p>
