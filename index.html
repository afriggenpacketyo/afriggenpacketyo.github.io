          <p>According to Gaza health officials and eyewitnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians seeking food, resulting in 32 deaths near two distribution hubs operated by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF, which denies any incidents occurred at its sites, stated the shootings happened hours before they opened. The Israeli military reported firing "warning shots" at suspects who approached their forces and is investigating the casualties. This event highlights the ongoing violence and catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where deadly incidents frequently occur as desperate civilians attempt to access scarce aid supplies.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat carrying 48 Vietnamese passengers and five crew members capsized during a sudden thunderstorm in Vietnam's popular Ha Long Bay, resulting in at least 34 fatalities. Rescue workers managed to save 11 people, but 23 others remain missing as search efforts continue. According to reports, the boat overturned due to strong winds, and many of the passengers were tourists from Hanoi, including about 20 children. The tragedy occurred as Tropical Storm Wipha is forecast to approach the region, threatening further severe weather conditions in the coming days.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations across the United Kingdom protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization have led to at least 80 arrests. The largest protest in London saw 55 people arrested for displaying placards in support of the group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The ban followed an incident where activists caused millions in damage to aircraft at an RAF base. The protests, which also occurred in cities like Bristol and Manchester, come as the group's co-founder prepares to challenge the proscription in the High Court.</p>

          <p>Members of Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Christian activist group, recently visited the Jersey Shore to advocate for chastity before marriage among young people. The Gen Z activists engaged beachgoers in conversations about love and relationships, often framing their message as a countercultural response to the perceived superficiality of social media and modern dating culture. Rather than focusing strictly on abstinence, they define chastity as seeing a person for their whole being and fostering deeper intimacy. The article explores their approach in a setting synonymous with hedonism, highlighting the challenges and convictions of promoting a traditional message to a new generation.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a crucial election, far-right political parties in Japan, such as Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan, are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment. These groups are challenging the ruling Liberal Democratic Party by focusing on issues like unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners, echoing nationalist movements in the US and Europe. While businesses advocate for more foreign labor to address shortages, these parties argue for stricter controls and prioritizing "Japanese capabilities." This rhetoric resonates with some voters amid economic anxieties, even as data shows a decrease in arrests of foreign residents in recent years.</p>

The throw caught Yankees runner Jorbit Vivas, who was attempting to advance, by surprise for the final out of the inning, completing a double play.

According to the report, workers had reported vibrations and were told to cover up defects, with a health and safety officer even resigning in protest before the collapse.

Such a move could destabilize financial markets, undermine the central bank's independence, and potentially harden the Fed's stance on interest rates. The article suggests the ongoing criticism may be a political strategy to create a scapegoat for any future economic downturn, regardless of whether a firing is actually attempted.

          <h2>Bestselling Author Argues 'Follow Your Passion' is the Worst Career Advice from Billionaires</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to entrepreneur and NYU professor Scott Galloway, the worst piece of career advice is to "follow your passion," a sentiment he claims is often dispensed by those who are already wealthy. Instead of pursuing a passion blindly, Galloway advises individuals to find something they are good at that also has the potential to be financially lucrative. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting when necessary, rather than from a linear pursuit of a single interest. This approach, which involves combining personal strengths with market opportunities, is echoed by other successful leaders like Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach.</p>

          <p>Tanning is experiencing a cultural comeback, moving beyond a simple aesthetic choice to become associated with a political and health ideology. The article notes the prevalence of tans among figures in the MAGA movement and points to health officials like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his advisors, who question mainstream guidance on sun avoidance. This new "sun worship" is fueled by alternative-health influencers who promote sunlight as a natural remedy and spread conspiracy theories about sunscreen. This trend defies established medical risks of skin cancer, framing tanning as an act of defiance against the scientific establishment.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) and will reduce its workforce by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. The ORD has historically provided the scientific foundation for the agency's regulations, but its functions will now be shifted to other program offices. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the changes will make the agency more efficient, while critics, including a union leader and a ranking House Democrat, warned the move will "devastate public health" by dismantling the agency's core scientific capabilities. The layoffs follow a recent Supreme Court ruling that facilitated the administration's plans to downsize the federal workforce.</p>

An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the widespread flooding that was feared. However, the dry, parched ground from the recent heatwave increases the likelihood of surface water runoff. The unsettled weather is expected to continue, with additional alerts for heavy rain and thunderstorms extending across England, Scotland, and Wales into Monday.</p>

The 27-year-old has not been assigned a squad number for the upcoming season.

          <p>A month after U.S. airstrikes targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, the full extent of the damage and the status of Iran's enriched uranium remain unclear. The operation, which used powerful "bunker buster" bombs, aimed to cripple facilities where Iran has been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. While the IAEA has not detected increased radiation in the region, experts warn of the chemical dangers if storage tanks were breached. The fate of Iran's existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium is a primary concern, with conflicting reports on whether it was moved before the strikes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress's recent approval of President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in federal funds is being viewed as a significant test case for future government appropriations. Unlike traditional budget bills that require a 60-vote, bipartisan majority in the Senate, this rescission request passed with only 51 votes. Political analysts suggest this could set a precedent for a more partisan budgeting process, allowing the majority party to claw back previously approved spending without needing bipartisan support. This procedural shift could dramatically alter how the federal government has been funded for years, moving away from a system that necessitates compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

The powerful magnetic field of the machine pulled the chain, and consequently the man, into the device, causing severe and ultimately fatal injuries.

Instead of fixating on a specific number, experts advise focusing on whether your financial habits align with your core values and goals.
