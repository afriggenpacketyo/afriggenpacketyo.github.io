Management forecasts $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion in second-quarter revenue and $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion for the year, driven by new client acquisitions and infrastructure demand.

          <p>A direct communication hotline between the Pentagon and the air traffic control tower at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has been out of service since March 2022 due to construction at the Pentagon. This was revealed during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing following a deadly January collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a commercial jet approaching the airport, which killed 67 people. The FAA became aware of the issue after the accident and is insisting on its repair before resuming operations from the Pentagon's Army Heliport. Hotlines are common for air traffic control facilities to communicate with critical offices, such as weather agencies, government buildings, and military facilities.</p>

In the previous game of the series, RodrÃ­guez misplayed a similar fly ball, resulting in a home run for Grisham.

          <p>Satellite images show Israel preparing sites in Gaza for aid distribution centers as part of a plan criticized by the UN. The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million people was at "critical risk" of famine. The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces. The UN insists it will not cooperate with the plan, saying it contradicts humanitarian principles, while humanitarian organizations call it a "farce" and urge Israel to lift the siege and open crossings.</p>

          <p>The Greer Fire, a wildfire in eastern Arizona, has grown to over 6,400 acres with 0% containment as of Wednesday. Fueled by winds, vegetation, and terrain, the fire is moving north through Hobson Canyon onto state trust lands, prompting evacuations in the unincorporated community of Greer. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs reported that multiple structures have been destroyed, and more than 200 personnel are working to combat the blaze. High wind gusts are expected to continue, posing challenges for containment efforts and resulting in road closures, including Highway 260 near Greer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to deport Kseniia Petrova, a Harvard researcher, back to Russia, despite her fears of arrest due to her history of political protest. Petrova, who fled Russia in 2022, faces criminal smuggling charges for failing to declare scientific samples she was carrying in her luggage. Judge Reiss repeatedly quizzed the government lawyers about their grounds for canceling Ms. Petrovaâ€™s visa and detaining her. Her lawyer argues the charges, filed three months after the alleged violation, are intended to justify her deportation after a judge scheduled a bail hearing. The smuggling charge could lead to a 20-year prison sentence or a $250,000 fine.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction, escalating a conflict between the Trump administration and local authorities over immigration enforcement. Dugan allegedly misdirected federal agents away from a person in her courtroom who is in the U.S. illegally. Dugan filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, claiming judicial immunity, while prosecutors argue her actions were outside her judicial authority. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan, and she is expected to plead not guilty at her arraignment.

His remarks resonated with some in the Middle East who criticize past U.S. interventions.

Trump's visit focused on business deals and diplomatic efforts, including urging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and meeting with the new leader of Syria.

These groups are pressuring the Trump administration to restrict or ban the drug, despite scientific evidence supporting its safety. Kennedy's decision follows a report claiming higher complication rates from mifepristone, a claim disputed by medical experts. Anti-abortion leaders plan to use this report to lobby for stricter access to the drug, including ending telemedicine prescriptions, potentially leading to a full ban.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest forward Taiwo Awoniyi has regained consciousness after undergoing surgery to repair a severe abdominal injury sustained during a match against Leicester City. Awoniyi collided with a goalpost, resulting in a ruptured intestine, and was placed in an induced coma for monitoring post-surgery. The club is initiating an internal review of the incident, as Awoniyi received on-field medical attention but remained in the game despite the injury. The review will likely focus on player safety protocols and medical decision-making during matches.</p>
