            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are continuing their strike after overwhelmingly rejecting the city council's latest pay offer, escalating a month-long dispute over proposed pay cuts for drivers and the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles. The Unite union deems the offer inadequate, while the council insists it is fair, leading to a major incident declaration due to accumulating rubbish. Military planners have been called in to assist with the cleanup, while neighboring councils have offered support. Public health concerns are mounting due to the uncollected waste and vermin, with residents expressing frustration over the prolonged strike.</p>

            <p>A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey indicates growing consumer anxiety over rising inflation, unemployment, and stock market instability due to the escalating global trade war.

The survey also reflects increased pessimism regarding stock market performance and a shift towards gold as a safer investment.

            <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors assessed President Trump's unexpected tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and electronic components.

            <p>Democratic senators are pressing the Social Security Administration (SSA) regarding potential staff cuts, particularly within the Office of the Chief Investment Officer (OCIO), which is responsible for data protection and claims processing systems. The senators expressed concern that these cuts could lead to website and benefit disruptions, impacting millions of Americans. They also noted the SSA's website issues and field office glitches. The lawmakers criticized the cuts as "intentional and dangerous," arguing that OCIO staff are essential for maintaining the agency's systems.</p>

They contend that settling with the government would undermine the firm's ability to zealously represent its clients and uphold the rule of law.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff war has increased the cost of imported research supplies for scientific labs in both the United States and China. Experts suggest that the US could be more severely affected, at least initially. The tariffs impact essential lab infrastructure, including glassware, reagents, spectrometers, and DNA sequencers. The sudden increase in costs could significantly hinder scientific research efforts in the US.</p>
