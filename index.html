          <h2>India Becomes Top Smartphone Exporter to the U.S., Surpassing China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 04:34:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, with its share of U.S. imports jumping to 44% in the second quarter. This significant shift, representing a 240% increase in volume from the previous year, is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. While global manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola are also increasing production in India, Apple's move is the most substantial, though the company still relies on China for its premium models. This trend highlights a broader realignment of global supply chains.</p>

The incident prompted a massive police response, with streets blocked off and nearby buildings placed on lockdown for hours.

          <p>NYPD officer Didarul Islam, 36, was one of four victims killed in a shooting at a Park Avenue office building. Officials praised Islam, a Bangladeshi immigrant and father of two with a third child on the way, as a hero who died protecting New Yorkers. Mayor Eric Adams highlighted his service and the profound loss to his family and community, who remembered him as an active mosque member and mentor. The attack was carried out by a lone gunman who also died from what is believed to be a self-inflicted wound.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike on a prison in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine has killed 17 inmates and wounded 42 others. Ukrainian officials reported that the Bilenke penitentiary was struck by eight high-explosive glide bombs, which are difficult to intercept. The attack destroyed several buildings within the complex and drew condemnation from Ukrainian authorities, who labeled it a war crime and a gross violation of humanitarian law. The strike occurred amid ongoing fighting, including a separate deadly Ukrainian drone attack in Russia's Rostov region.</p>

          <p>In Nigeria's northern Zamfara state, kidnappers have killed at least 35 of the 56 people they abducted from a village in March, despite having received ransom payments. A local official confirmed that the victims, mostly young people, were slaughtered after their families paid the demanded sum. The gunmen released 18 women and one boy, but the bodies of the deceased are not expected to be returned. This brutal act highlights the escalating crisis of kidnapping-for-ransom by criminal gangs in the region, a problem a 2022 law making ransom payments illegal has failed to curb.</p>

Created in Japan in 1974, the monkey-like doll became a global phenomenon in the 1980s, especially in Europe. Interestingly, due to Cold War restrictions, capitalist West Germany's popular Monchhichi was not available in communist East Germany. Instead, a state-owned enterprise in the toy-making town of Sonneberg produced a nearly identical version called the Tiemi, which became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc. Today, both original Monchhichis and the rarer Tiemi dolls are sought-after collector's items for nostalgic adults.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by its investment banking division, where income rose 10% year-on-year to £3.3 billion due to heightened market volatility. Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from increased trading in currency and fixed income markets, which helped offset a decline in advisory fees. The results come as the bank continues its three-year strategic plan focused on cost reduction and delivering more stable returns for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman in the deadly Midtown Manhattan shooting as 27-year-old Shane Devon Tamura of Las Vegas. Police stated Tamura had a documented mental health history and recently drove across the country to New York. After arriving, he entered an office building on Park Avenue with a high-powered rifle, killing four people, including a police officer, before taking his own life on the 33rd floor. Investigators found additional ammunition and medication in his vehicle, but his motive and connection to the specific location remain under investigation.</p>

The suspect, who had no known connection to the victims, began shooting in the valet area before fleeing through the parking lot.

The hardest-hit areas are the outlying districts of Miyun and Yanqing, where some towns received over 21 inches of rain. The storms have forced the relocation of over 80,000 people in Beijing, knocked out power, and damaged roads and communication lines. In neighboring Hebei province, a landslide killed four people.

After relocating to Bengal, his raw talent was recognized, and with coaching to build his self-belief, he rose through domestic cricket and the IPL to earn a spot on the national team.

The EU has committed an initial €20 billion to the initiative, which has already attracted significant interest from member states. However, the plan faces challenges, including the need for massive private investment, high energy costs, and the modernization of Europe's power grid to support such energy-intensive operations.

The steepest annual increases were seen in commuter towns like Ascot and northern regions like Rochdale, driven by high demand and low supply. Although the rate of rent increases is beginning to slow, the number of available rental properties remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA) shares fell over 8% after the carrier reported a 59% plunge in its first-quarter net profit, which fell to S$186 million. The significant decline was largely attributed to losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex and costly restructuring. While SIA's core operating profit also saw a 13.8% decline due to normalizing demand and increased competition, the financial drag from Air India was a major factor. Analysts noted that Air India's losses were deeper than expected and are likely to continue impacting SIA's bottom line in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of bribery and witness tampering. The verdict concludes a nearly six-month trial where prosecutors presented evidence that Uribe, a polarizing conservative figure, conspired to influence testimony from imprisoned former paramilitaries who had accused him of having links to their groups. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong U.S. support, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal. The case originated from a libel suit Uribe himself filed against a political opponent in 2012, which ultimately led to an investigation into his own actions.</p>
