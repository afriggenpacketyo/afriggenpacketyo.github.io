        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. would remove all sanctions against Syria, aiming to foster stability and peace in the war-torn nation. Speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Trump highlighted his administration's initial steps toward normalizing relations with Syria after over a decade of estrangement. Syria, designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979, has faced additional sanctions since 2004 and 2011. The toppling of the Assad regime in 2024 offered a chance for a new beginning under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, though the country still faces myriad international sanctions.</p>

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry giant, is preparing to address potential financial fallout from President Trump's tariffs on goods from Thailand and Vietnam. CEO Alexander Lacik outlined strategies including price increases and rerouting shipments to mitigate the impact, estimating potential costs of up to $135 million annually if tariffs remain high. The company is also streamlining its supply chain, such as altering distribution routes for Canada and Latin America, but moving production to the United States is not being considered due to higher labor costs. Despite the uncertainty, Lacik expressed confidence in Pandora's resilience, citing past successes in navigating economic challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the reinstatement of Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, who were previously banned due to gambling scandals. This decision makes them eligible for the Hall of Fame, with the earliest possible induction in 2028. Rose, banned in 1989 for betting on baseball, had his ban lifted posthumously, while Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, also gains eligibility. Hall of Fame Chairman Jane Forbes Clark stated that players affected by Manfred's ruling would be considered, though voters are also told to consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game."</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order giving pharmaceutical companies 30 days to voluntarily reduce the cost of prescription drugs or face new restrictions on what the government will pay. The order directs the Department of Health to negotiate new drug prices, potentially linking them to lower prices paid by other countries. The main pharmaceutical lobbying group opposed the order, arguing it would harm research and development. Trump threatened federal investigations into drug companies' practices and the opening of the U.S. drug market to more imports.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for prioritizing the resettlement of white South African refugees while simultaneously denying protections to other groups, such as Afghans. The State Department welcomed 59 Afrikaners under an executive order addressing racial discrimination, but questions arise about the funding of their travel. Critics point out that the administration is terminating temporary protected status for Afghans already in the U.S. and has drastically reduced refugee admissions from other countries. The situation has sparked allegations of hypocrisy and a double standard, as well as questions about who is footing the bill for the new arrivals.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with key components of a bill to fund President Trumpâ€™s agenda, including tax and Medicaid cuts, despite internal disagreements. The bill proposes massive cuts to Medicaid spending, including work requirements for recipients and more frequent eligibility checks. While the plan avoids some of the most drastic cuts sought by Republican hardliners, it faces opposition from both sides, with some Republicans opposing Medicaid cuts and others demanding more significant changes. The legislation also addresses culture war issues, such as stripping Medicaid funding from organizations that offer abortion services.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that the gap between Americans' earnings and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living is widening. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. In 2023, these households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, would need $67,000 to afford essential items. The cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2021, while median earnings for lower-income earners have fallen.</p>
