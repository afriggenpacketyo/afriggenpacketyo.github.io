        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing shortages, as stated by CEO Scott Kirby, who expressed disappointment but deemed it necessary to protect customers amidst FAA staffing issues. Former NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt noted this is a short-term fix, as controller pipeline issues cannot be resolved quickly. An FAA spokesperson cited equipment problems, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia, where the traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is located, as the cause of the delays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled plans to revamp the air traffic control system over the next three to four years to address these issues.</p>

          <p>A South Texas community, largely composed of SpaceX employees, voted overwhelmingly to establish a new city called Starbase, fulfilling Elon Musk's vision. The vote, administered by Cameron County, saw 212 out of 218 voters supporting the incorporation of Starbase, which covers about 1.5 square miles near the Mexican border. SpaceX has been developing the area since 2014, making it a central hub and launch site, and home to hundreds of employees. The new municipality would be eligible for state and federal grants, would have certain immunity from lawsuits and could also condemn property.</p>

          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a popular hot spring town in Japan known for its retro charm and resemblance to settings in "Spirited Away," has begun restricting visitors to combat overtourism. The town, which sees approximately 334,000 tourists annually, implemented admission restrictions for day-trippers, requiring them to use shuttle buses and purchase advance tickets. This measure aims to alleviate congestion, protect cultural heritage, and preserve the town's serene atmosphere, especially during peak seasons. While most visitors support the restrictions, some challenges remain, such as tourists gathering before the paid admission period.</p>

Attendees expressed excitement about the performance, emphasizing Lady Gaga's message of self-acceptance and individuality. Madonna gave a similar concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.</p>

          <p>China's central government has deployed inspection teams to investigate lower-level officials as part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. These inspections, known as xunshi, have led to the downfall of numerous officials, including heads of provincial areas and state ministries. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) has stationed 16 disciplinary inspection teams in various regions, including Shanxi province, where a former governor soon became the target of an investigation. The CCDI now largely generates its own leads rather than relying on public tip-offs.</p>
