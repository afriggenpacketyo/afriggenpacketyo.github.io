        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has reportedly turned down three takeover proposals from Paramount, the most recent valued at just under $24 per share, primarily in cash. This comes amidst widespread interest in acquiring Paramount. WBD has stated that it has received "unsolicited interest" from several parties and will conduct a comprehensive strategic review. Despite this review, WBD is proceeding with its prior plan to split into two entities, a streaming and studios business and a global networks business. Several other companies, including Netflix and Comcast, are rumored to be interested in Paramount. This article suggests that the market recognizes the significant value of WBD's portfolio.</p>

          <p>Beyond Meat shares experienced a surge and subsequent decline, reflecting the volatility of meme stock trading. The stock initially soared after being added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, triggering a short squeeze. This was further fueled by news of expanded distribution at Walmart stores. However, gains were later slashed as the meme stock rally faltered, highlighting the speculative nature of such trading activity. This article underscores the potential risks associated with investing in meme stocks and the influence of online communities on market movements.</p>

          <p>An American missionary was kidnapped from his home in Niamey, Niger, by three armed men, according to security sources. The abduction occurred near the presidential palace, where ousted President Mohamed Bazoum has been held since a coup two years ago. The kidnapped man has reportedly worked as a pilot for a U.S.-based charity since 2010. No demands have been made, and there has been no official response from the Nigerien government or the U.S. Embassy. The article notes that the abduction may be the work of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, which operates in the region.</p>

          <p>A woman in Kew, London, was initially fined £150 for pouring a small amount of leftover coffee down a road drain. She believed she was acting responsibly by avoiding spills on public transportation. However, enforcement officers stopped her and issued a fine under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Richmond-upon-Thames Council later canceled the fine after reviewing the incident and apologized for the inconvenience caused. This article raises questions about the proportionality of environmental fines and the clarity of regulations regarding waste disposal.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered that morin, a plant compound found in fruits like apples and guava, could potentially replace antibiotics in treating gum disease. Lab studies showed that a morin-based powder had antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects on bacterial biofilms mimicking gum disease. Researchers created a powder using a process similar to making powdered milk, allowing for controlled release inside the mouth. The compound could be incorporated into oral hygiene products, offering a natural, antibiotic-free alternative for preventing and managing gum disease.
