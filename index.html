Chinese markets were in focus, though the country's services activity hit a 15-month high due to stronger domestic and foreign demand. Australia's GDP expanded more than expected, marking its fastest growth since September 2023, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices saw declines.

          <p>A federal appeals court panel ruled that President Trump cannot use the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to quickly deport people accused of membership in a Venezuelan gang. The court agreed with immigrant rights lawyers that the law was not intended for peacetime immigration enforcement against such groups. This decision, which blocks a signature administration push, is likely headed for a final showdown at the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a significant legal check on executive power.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives committee released over 33,000 pages of documents from the investigation into disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While presented as a move for transparency, top Democrats on the committee noted that 97% of the released material was already public, criticizing the effort as a political spectacle rather than a genuine disclosure. The release comes amidst mounting cross-party calls for more transparency in the infamous case, with further records expected from the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded more than expected in the second quarter of the year, growing 1.8% year over year, marking its fastest pace since September 2023. This growth, surpassing Reuters' economist forecasts, was primarily driven by robust domestic spending, including household and government consumption. Despite heightened global uncertainty, the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates and sounded an optimistic note, though it reduced its economic growth forecast for the year to 1.7%. Consumer and business confidence are also picking up, suggesting a potential end to a long period of pessimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests over asylum seekers being housed in hotels are placing "chronic pressure" on UK police forces, compounding their duties this summer. Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, expressed concern over political and business leaders potentially spreading misinformation on social media, which exacerbates tensions. Police have responded to over 3,000 protests since June, with significant deployments to manage opposing groups. Stephens emphasized the need for leaders to diffuse tension and for better integration of refugees to reduce policing demand.</p>

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court reinstated Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, ruling that a president cannot fire FTC commissioners without cause. The court cited nearly a century of precedent, stating the government is unlikely to succeed on appeal. This decision rejects the Trump administration's attempt to remove her, marking a significant test for the independence of regulatory agencies. Slaughter expressed eagerness to return to her duties, asserting that "Trump is not above the law."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff confirmed that the company has cut 4,000 customer support roles, attributing the layoffs to increased efficiency from artificial intelligence. Benioff stated that AI tools, such as "Agentforce" customer service bots, have reduced the need for human personnel, leading to a decline in support cases. This move highlights AI's growing impact on various industries, prompting human resources consultants to advise workers on the need for new skill acquisition. Critics suggest some tech companies may be using AI as a justification for pandemic-era overhiring. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government cannot accurately calculate the total cost of a secret relocation plan established after a massive Afghan data breach, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). The Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimated £850 million for the breach and a new relocation scheme, but the NAO lacked confidence in this figure, noting it excluded legal and compensation costs. The breach, which leaked details of almost 19,000 Afghans and British officials, led to the creation of the Afghanistan Response Route to resettle 7,000 more individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery: waxworms can digest polyethylene, the most common type of plastic, converting it into body fat within days. Approximately 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire plastic bag in just 24 hours, a process compared to humans overeating steak. While the worms cannot survive solely on plastic, scientists are optimistic about developing a supplementary diet to maintain their health, potentially enabling them to serve as large-scale plastic-waste processors. This finding offers a promising biological solution to the global plastic pollution crisis.</p>

          <p>U.S. filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court battle against Rochdale Borough Council in England to gain control of Hopwood Hall, an ancestral stately home he spent seven years restoring. DePree claims he fulfilled the agreement to buy the hall for £1 by securing planning permission, but the council locked him out, arguing he failed to provide a viable business model. He alleges the council's conduct has been "evasive, misleading, and at times shocking," pouring £750,000 of his own money into the project.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, shooting lava 330 feet into the sky from its summit crater within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This marks the 32nd episode of the current eruption, which began in December 2024, with all lava flows contained within the crater. Scientists monitor the volcano's magma chambers and ground changes to predict eruptions, noting that while recent lava fountains have been shorter, the spectacle continues. Kilauea remains one of the world's most active volcanoes.</p>
