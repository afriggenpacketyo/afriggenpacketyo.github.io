          <p>First Solar's stock experienced a significant drop after CEO Mark Widmar expressed concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs on the company's manufacturing operations. Widmar stated that the tariffs introduced unexpected challenges for 2025, leading to analysts downgrading the stock. Despite being the largest publicly traded solar module manufacturer in the U.S., First Solar faces headwinds due to the scale of the tariffs, impacting investor confidence. The company had been viewed as well-positioned to handle tariffs due to its U.S. manufacturing facilities, but the severity of the tariffs has altered this perception.</p>

Forests absorb and store approximately 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, playing a crucial role in regulating the planet's temperature, and the Biomass satellite will help fill data gaps related to carbon storage.

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on members of the European Parliament and their families, signaling a potential thaw in relations amid growing transatlantic strains caused by President Trump. This move is seen as a charm offensive aimed at drawing Europe away from the United States' orbit, with Beijing hoping to revive a bilateral investment pact that was frozen following human rights concerns in 2021. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola emphasized the importance of unrestricted dialogue and engagement with China, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of EU-China relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's tariff strategy is inadvertently strengthening ties between China and other Global South nations, rather than driving a wedge between them. As an example, China and Brazil have increased high-level engagement in response to tariffs imposed by the U.S., and China's top diplomat Wang Yi called for Brasilia and Beijing to oppose the "law of the jungle" together. This growing cooperation could give fresh impetus to joint efforts for greater clout in the global governance system, as nations seek alternatives to reliance on the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump attributed the recent contraction in U.S. GDP to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while defending his sweeping tariff policies. The U.S. economy shrank by 0.3% in the first quarter, marking the first negative growth since 2022, and Trump claimed that his promised economic "boom" would "take a while" to materialize. However, the Commerce Department attributed the GDP decline to a surge in imports ahead of Trump's tariffs and a drop in government spending due to canceled federal contracts, contradicting Trump's claims.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the release of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian man who led protests against the war in Gaza and was arrested by immigration officials during his U.S. citizenship interview. Mahdawi's lawyers argue that he was detained in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian human rights, and his notice to appear in immigration court states that his presence would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences. The government maintains that Mahdawi's detention is a valid aspect of the deportation process.</p>

CFO Lanny Baker said Etsy is "staying nimble in the face of uncertainty" around tariff announcements and has established a task force to guide buyers and sellers, and approximately 90% of sellers source their products domestically, reducing reliance on imports.</p>

          <p>The author argues that the US is experiencing a slow constitutional collapse, with checks on executive power vanishing and the Trump administration acting as if neither the courts nor the people have any prerogatives. Science is suffering due to funding cuts, and the economy is in chaos, and immigrants have lost the entitlement to due process. While the first 100 days of Trump's second term are similar to his first, they have been more reckless and focused on consolidating power, and the author states that it is difficult to speak of American "democracy" with a straight face.</p>

          <h2>Media Hasn't Learned Lessons from Vietnam War</h2>

          <p>The author contends that the US media has not learned its lesson from the Vietnam War, and mythology about US media coverage is locked into the faulty premise that news outlets were pivotal in causing Americans to turn against it. The reporting routinely amounts to stenographic services for the White House and Pentagon, and the American press was careful to stay away from atrocity stories about the troops. The author states that the latest two presidents have taught a new generation of Americans what Johnson and Nixon taught baby boomers during the Vietnam war.</p>
