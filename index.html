          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, called for increased global trade collaboration despite rising tariffs and barriers. Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against turning trade into a political or security issue. He advocated for "reshaping the rules and order" of the international economy through collaborative processes. Adam Tooze, a Columbia University professor, interpreted Li's comments as a call for a pluralization of global economic order, with a focus on processes rather than a single dominant entity. The article highlights China's perspective on international trade relations and its desire for a more collaborative global economic environment. The Chinese premier believes that it is best for all nations to collaborate on trade for the sake of reshaping the rules and order.</p>

          <p>The UK government will acquire 12 new F-35 A fighter jets equipped to carry nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission. Downing Street described this as the "biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." These jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review, prompted by increasing nuclear risks from other states. Prime Minister Starmer pledged to meet a new NATO target of spending 5% of the UK's GDP on national security by 2035. This investment aims to bolster national security amid growing global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump expressed frustration with both Israel and Iran after violations of a ceasefire he had announced. He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for escalating the conflict and denounced cable news channels for questioning the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear sites. Trump claimed the U.S. military had "obliterated" Iranian nuclear facilities, but a preliminary report suggested the damage only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months. He also attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) after she called for his impeachment. Trump's remarks reflect the volatile nature of the situation and his focus on personal achievements.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian discusses the ongoing debate over the origins of COVID-19, arguing that it reflects a deep-seated public distrust of science rather than a simple political divide. The author contends that framing the issue as a left-right conflict oversimplifies the problem. The piece highlights the role of scientists and researchers who believe the lab-leak theory deserves further investigation. It emphasizes the need for transparency, accountability, and humility from the scientific community to rebuild public trust, particularly in the context of virus research and emerging diseases. The article suggests that a lack of transparency has caused more distrust in the scientific community.</p>

          <p>China plans to increase gold production and reserves over the next three years due to soaring demand and geopolitical tensions.

Gold is considered a strategic mineral resource with both commodity and currency attributes, crucial for maintaining national industrial and financial security. The ministry stated that China's gold industry faces challenges, including insufficient resource security and difficulties in meeting demand from key technologies. China has been the world's top gold consumer for 12 years, with gold output standing at 377.24 tonnes last year.</p>

The White House Press Secretary called the intelligence assessment "flat-out wrong," maintaining that the strikes resulted in "total obliteration."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China and India are reducing their imports of Indonesian thermal coal in favor of higher-calorific value (CV) coal from other regions. This shift is driven by a global fall in prices, making higher-quality coal more competitive. Indonesian coal exports to China and India have declined significantly, while imports from Mongolia, South Africa, and Tanzania have increased. The shift towards higher-grade coal allows both nations to generate more energy per ton, improving efficiency. Overall, Chinese and Indian coal imports have decreased, but Indonesian exports have been particularly affected. This illustrates the changing dynamics of the global coal market.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded earlier. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with younger voters. Cuomo's campaign indicated he might consider an independent run in the general election. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count since no candidate reached 50%, with comprehensive results expected on July 1. The winner of the primary will likely have an advantage in the November general election, though incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent.</p>

          <p>California leaders reached a tentative agreement on the state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The agreement reflects the challenge of overhauling environmental regulations to speed up housing construction.

The plan restores cost-of-living adjustments for child-care workers and provides additional funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants. The agreement is expected to serve as a precursor to more challenging financial discussions in the months ahead. The budget deal is not yet finalized.</p>

US President Donald Trump has denied the news, saying that the US strikes had "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. The extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities and sites remains unclear. The America strikes on Iranian nuclear sites used conventional weapons as well as bunker-busting bombs, believed to be the only bombs capable of destroying Iran's underground Fordo nuclear site.</p>
