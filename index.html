          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 11:19:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is entering its third week without resolution, as Democratic lawmakers express a significant lack of trust in President Donald Trump, preventing the formation of bipartisan negotiating groups. Historically, these 'gangs' of legislators have been crucial in breaking such deadlocks, but Democrats fear the president could unilaterally sabotage any agreement reached. This stalemate persists despite polls indicating that a majority of Americans blame the president and Republicans for the shutdown, with leaders on both sides holding firm on their respective demands before reopening the government. The situation underscores the deep partisan divisions and erosion of trust currently defining Washington politics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey reveals a decline in President Donald Trump's approval rating for his handling of the economy, now at a net negative of -13, the lowest of his presidency. This drop is attributed to growing public concern over jobs, inflation, and the ongoing government shutdown, for which 53% of respondents blame the president and congressional Republicans. The survey highlights particularly low approval for his policies on inflation and tariffs, with independents showing significant negative sentiment. These findings suggest that personal financial pressures are weighing more heavily on Americans' economic confidence than the political stalemate in Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 holiday season is projected to set new travel records, with Americans expected to spend approximately $311 billion on flights and hotels. Travel experts are urging consumers to book their Thanksgiving and Christmas plans soon, recommending final bookings by the first week of November to avoid escalating prices. Airlines are responding to the anticipated surge by adding around 250,000 more seats for Thanksgiving travel. For those traveling by car, falling national gas prices, which are approaching $3 per gallon, are expected to provide some financial relief during the busy period.</p>

          <p>Prominent investor Ron Conway has resigned from the Salesforce Foundation board after CEO Marc Benioff suggested federal troops could address policing shortages in San Francisco. Benioff's comments, which he later appeared to walk back, were amplified by figures like Elon Musk and President Trump, sparking significant controversy. In his resignation email, Conway reportedly told Benioff that their values were no longer aligned, marking a notable public break between two major figures in the tech and philanthropic communities. The incident has intensified the debate over public safety and the role of federal intervention in American cities.</p>

          <p>Graham Platner, a Democratic hopeful for the U.S. Senate in Maine, is facing scrutiny over deleted social media posts from 2018 in which he appeared to advocate for violence to achieve political goals. The Marine veteran, who has since disavowed the comments, referred to himself as a 'communist' and argued for an 'armed working class' in the unearthed Reddit posts. Platner stated he was 's***posting' during a difficult time after his military service and that the comments do not reflect his current views as a small business owner. The revelations come as the Democratic primary intensifies with the entry of Governor Janet Mills, who is seen by party leadership as a strong contender against Republican Senator Susan Collins.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire in the Middle East, President Donald Trump is shifting focus to the war in Ukraine, announcing an upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. Trump stated the summit aims to end the nearly four-year-long conflict, leveraging a recent phone call where Putin congratulated him on the Gaza peace deal. To increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a move the Kremlin has warned would be a 'serious escalation.' This renewed diplomatic push signals a change in Trump's approach, reflecting growing frustration with the prolonged war.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a significant sell-off after two U.S. regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, reported issues with bad or fraudulent loans. The news sparked fears about underlying risks in the banking sector, causing the UK's FTSE 100 to drop and hitting major European banks like Deutsche Bank. Investors, already nervous after recent failures in the private credit market, reacted by seeking safe-haven assets, pushing the price of gold to a new record high. The market turbulence highlights growing concerns about poor risk management and loose lending standards in parts of the U.S. financial system.</p>

The state's vast geography and the high street value of drugs make it a target for trafficking, with Indigenous populations disproportionately affected. In response, community has become a critical lifeline, with residents in places like the 'Dog House' in Williwaw and homeless encampments in Anchorage relying on each other to administer the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. These grassroots harm reduction efforts highlight a culture of mutual support amid a crisis exacerbated by isolation and systemic challenges.</p>

The conviction was based on a web of circumstantial evidence, including a neighbor hearing screams, a statement from their son about a fight, and Jubillar's own prior threats to kill her. Prosecutors argued he murdered Delphine after she revealed she was having an affair and wanted a divorce on the night she disappeared in December 2020. The defense maintained his innocence, arguing the lack of a body or forensic evidence meant there was no certainty a crime occurred, and plans to appeal the verdict.</p>

The Trump administration reportedly threatened tariffs against countries that voted in favor of the plan, which the president had labeled a 'green scam.'

The call comes during a tense week after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports in response to new export controls from Beijing. Despite the threat, which Trump admitted may not be 'sustainable,' he expressed optimism about the relationship, stating, 'I think we're going to do fine with China.' The direct communication between the top economic officials could signal an effort to de-escalate tensions and find a path forward.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, federal student loan borrowers are still required to make their monthly payments. While most routine loan tasks are handled by contracted servicers and remain operational, some critical functions are delayed. Specifically, the final approval for loan forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, is on hold because it requires action from furloughed Department of Education staff. This delay could create tax complications for borrowers, as a provision making student loan forgiveness tax-free is set to expire at the end of 2025, underscoring the widespread consequences of the political stalemate.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a federal judge to dismiss his indictment or remove the death penalty as an option. They argue that President Donald Trump's public statements calling Mangione 'a pure assassin,' which were subsequently shared by Justice Department officials, have tainted the potential jury pool and are making their client a 'pawn' in a political agenda. The defense filing contends that the traditional separation between the White House and the Justice Department has eroded, making the government's claim that the statements are irrelevant unconvincing. Prosecutors maintain that enough time will pass before a trial for any prejudice to fade.</p>

          <p>Voters in Bexar County, Texas, will soon decide whether to approve up to $311 million in venue taxes to help finance a new downtown arena for the San Antonio Spurs. The team has pledged to contribute at least $500 million to the project and cover any cost overruns, arguing that the plan will not raise property taxes for residents. However, the proposal faces considerable opposition from groups against using public funds for private ventures and from officials who want more analysis of the city's financial commitment. With recent polls showing a tight race, the outcome of the Nov. 4 vote will be crucial for the team's future in the city.</p>

          <p>As of mid-October 2025, the price of gold stands at $4,211.71 per ounce, reflecting its continued appeal as a safe-haven asset for investors. The value of the precious metal is influenced by a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, inflation rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and central bank policies. Gold prices often rise during times of economic instability or when the purchasing power of fiat currencies declines, as investors seek assets that historically retain their value.

          <p>A Russian street fighting organization, Streets Fight Club (SFC), which has previously raised funds for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has expanded its operations into the U.S. with assistance from American white supremacist groups. An investigation by The Guardian found that SFC promoted violent combat events in the southern U.S. featuring members of the neo-Nazi 'active club' movement and the neo-fascist Patriot Front. The group uses social media platforms like Instagram and, until recently, YouTube to broadcast its bare-knuckle brawls and recruit fighters, many of whom openly display neo-Nazi symbols. This expansion highlights a concerning link between Russian nationalist groups and far-right extremists in America.</p>

While the device offers a robust alternative to competitors like the Steam Deck, it functions more as a streaming accessory for an existing Xbox console rather than a standalone mobile one. The release coincides with Microsoft's controversial price hike for its Game Pass subscription service, which has angered many fans. The Ally X is seen as a high-performance but compromised device, appealing to tech enthusiasts but not necessarily broadening the Xbox brand's reach.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates declining, financial experts are questioning the traditional '1% rule,' which advises homeowners to only refinance if they can lower their interest rate by at least one percentage point. In the current environment, many argue that even a smaller rate reduction, such as 0.5%, can offer substantial savings, particularly for borrowers with large loan balances or those who secured mortgages in the recent high-rate period. The decision also depends on factors like the remaining loan term and the primary goal of the refinance, such as consolidating high-interest debt, which could make the move beneficial even without a rate drop.

The decision, made without public consultation or competitive bidding, has raised concerns about national sovereignty, economic control, and security, especially given the port's proximity to major naval bases. Critics, including military officials and economists, argue that an unelected, temporary government should not be making such long-term strategic decisions with profound geopolitical implications.

          <p>Small businesses across the United States are struggling under the financial weight of President Trump's tariffs, forcing many to take out high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less leverage to absorb the increased costs, making them a potential early indicator of broader economic trouble. Business owners report that while they are trying to manage by passing costs to consumers, they are already seeing a decline in sales. Economists warn that these struggles could be a 'canary in the coal mine,' signaling that larger businesses may face similar pressures in the near future as their inventory strategies run their course.
