          <p>Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons is calling for Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to apologize after Walz likened ICE agents to a "modern-day Gestapo" during a commencement speech. Lyons condemned the comparison as dehumanizing and dangerous, citing a significant increase in assaults against ICE officers. Walz, a Democrat, had criticized the Trump administration's deportation policies, prompting Lyons to accuse him of preferring violent criminal aliens to be released into Minnesota's communities. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also criticized Walz's comments as inciting insurrection and violence.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 15:10:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Americans can anticipate significantly higher home electricity bills this summer, potentially reaching a 12-year high due to projected high temperatures and rising electricity prices. According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), the average home electricity bill is expected to be $784, a more than 6% increase from last year. This increase will disproportionately affect low-income families, who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy costs. Experts caution that some households may forgo air conditioning, leading to potential health risks such as heat stroke.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several newspapers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, mistakenly published a syndicated summer reading list that included fictitious books by well-known authors. The list, provided by King Features, contained only five real titles out of fifteen, and writer Marco Buscaglia admitted that it was partially generated by Artificial Intelligence. The error has sparked outrage among readers and writers, raising concerns about the integrity of syndicated content and the impact of AI on the media landscape. This incident highlights the challenges of maintaining accuracy and quality in the face of increasing reliance on AI-generated content, particularly as news organizations grapple with financial constraints and staff reductions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily reinstated Maine state lawmaker Laurel Libby's right to vote in the state House of Representatives after she was censured for a Facebook post identifying a transgender student athlete. Libby's post criticized the state's policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports, leading to her censure and suspension from voting. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, arguing that the Court has been too quick to intervene in such matters. The case raises questions about free speech, legislative immunity, and the rights of transgender athletes.</p>

          <p>The narrative surrounding President Biden's age and fitness for office continues to dominate Washington discussions, fueled by a new book detailing his alleged cognitive decline. The book, titled 'Original Sin,' portrays Biden as frail and self-deluded, with anecdotes of him forgetting names and struggling with basic tasks. While the White House has attempted to downplay these concerns, the author of this article argues that Biden's condition is evident to anyone paying attention. The article suggests that the constant focus on Biden's age is becoming tiresome, especially given the inherent cynicism of political spin and the public's existing perceptions of his infirmity.</p>
