          <h2>Trump Questions Trade Relationship with Canada Before Meeting Prime Minister Carney</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 11:52:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly criticized the U.S.'s trade relationship with Canada just before meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney, claiming the U.S. subsidizes Canada by $200 billion annually and provides free military protection. Trump questioned the need for Canadian goods like cars, energy, and lumber, asserting that Canada relies heavily on the U.S. for its needs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed this sentiment, portraying Canada as an economic dependent on the United States. Canada's exports to the U.S. decreased in March, while exports to other countries increased, signaling a potential shift in trade dynamics amidst Trump's tariffs. This article highlights the contentious trade environment between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision jeopardizes Martin's confirmation prospects, as it could lead to a tie vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, preventing the nomination from advancing. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire soon. The article underscores the internal divisions within the Republican party regarding judicial nominations and the legacy of the January 6th riot.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a significant drop of over 10% despite the company reporting ongoing revenue growth acceleration. Analysts raised concerns about modest full-year revenue guidance and a decline in international commercial revenue. Despite exceeding revenue expectations and increasing its revenue guidance for the year, the company's high software multiple makes it susceptible to compression as revenue growth slows. CEO Alex Karp remained optimistic, stating that Palantir is "on fire" due to a combination of 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Travelers at Newark Liberty International Airport have faced significant delays and cancellations due to a combination of air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and runway construction.

Some air traffic controllers have taken trauma leave due to equipment outages, while runway construction is also causing congestion. United Airlines has canceled flights from Newark due to these challenges, prompting calls for investigations and modernization of the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>A single late payment can significantly impact your credit score, potentially affecting loan rates and financial opportunities. While legitimate late payments remain on credit reports for up to seven years, several strategies can be employed to mitigate their impact.

Consistently making on-time payments after a late mark can help rebuild credit faster.</p>

          <p>Britain and India have reached a trade agreement aimed at strengthening economic ties amidst global trade tensions led by the U.S. The deal, expected to increase bilateral trade by $34 billion, includes tariff reductions on various goods, with India reducing tariffs on British whiskey and cars, and Britain reducing tariffs on clothes and food products. The agreement comes as countries seek to bolster alliances after President Trump's tariff policies created economic uncertainty. The trade deal is expected to catalyze trade, investment, growth, job creation and innovation in both economies.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz was elected as Germany's chancellor in a second parliamentary vote after failing to secure the necessary support in the first round. Merz, from the center-right Christian Democratic Union, needed at least 316 votes but initially received only 310. Following the successful vote, he was officially appointed chancellor by the German President. Merz's election follows Germany's federal election in February, where his party secured the largest share of votes, and he is expected to form a coalition government with the center-left Social Democratic Party.</p>
