          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that he anticipates extending the August 12 deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods during upcoming negotiations in Stockholm. The talks, hosted by Sweden, aim to build on a 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs agreed upon in May. Bessent expressed optimism, hoping discussions will also cover China's manufacturing surplus and its support for Russia. This follows a period of intense trade conflict where both nations had imposed tariffs exceeding 100% on each other's imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's menacing stage persona and powerful vocals defined a new genre of music, influencing countless artists. After being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 for his excessive behavior, he launched a highly successful solo career and later gained a new generation of fans through the reality TV show "The Osbournes." He was a two-time inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, both with his band and as a solo artist.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 individuals from Afghanistan and Cameroon. While acknowledging the plaintiffs' case has merit, the court found insufficient evidence to block the policy's implementation during the ongoing lawsuit. The decision means thousands who fled conflict and instability now face the risk of deportation unless they can secure another legal status. Advocacy groups have expressed alarm, warning that lives will be upended and families separated.</p>

          <p>Amid rising inflation and concerns about retirement funds, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity. This article advises homeowners aged 62 and older to ask critical questions before proceeding, such as whether it's the smartest way to borrow and if they can manage with existing funds. It also stresses the importance of considering the financial impact on beneficiaries, as the loan must be repaid upon the homeowner's death. Finally, it suggests evaluating which payment option—lump sum, monthly payments, or a line of credit—best suits their individual financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies experienced a volatile downturn after a dramatic, short-lived rally driven by retail traders on social media. The stock, which had surged by 400% in July, fell sharply on Tuesday, indicating the speculative momentum had faded. The rally was fueled by mentions on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum and significant short interest, which can trigger a "short squeeze" as investors buy shares to cover their positions. The heightened activity in options trading also contributed to the extreme price swings, highlighting the ongoing influence of meme stock culture on the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent economist Mohamed El-Erian has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign from his position. El-Erian argued that stepping down would be the best way to safeguard the central bank's operational autonomy from what he described as "growing and broadening threats." His stance breaks with the general Wall Street consensus, which favors Powell completing his term. The call comes amid increased political pressure on the Fed, including comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about "mission creep" within the institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he will not attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that Powell "is going to be out pretty soon anyway." This comment appears to de-escalate weeks of public attacks on Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively. Despite his criticism, Trump seems willing to let Powell's term run its course until May 2026, a move that could calm financial markets concerned about a potential clash over the Fed's independence. The administration has also intensified pressure through other means, calling for a review of the Fed's operations and renovation project. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT have developed a groundbreaking bionic knee that allows above-the-knee amputees to walk more naturally. The system, called e-OPRA, involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic limb and integrates with muscle tissue. This direct connection bypasses the need for traditional, often uncomfortable sockets and allows the prosthesis to respond to the user's intent for smoother, more intuitive movement. While still in clinical trials, the technology represents a major breakthrough in restoring not just mobility but also a sense of body ownership for amputees.</p>

          <p>On-location entertainment production in the Los Angeles area decreased by 6.2% in the second quarter compared to last year, according to a report by FilmLA. The decline was driven by significant drops in feature film and commercial shoots, which fell by 21.4% and 15.3% respectively. However, the television category provided a bright spot, with on-location shoot days increasing by 17%, fueled by gains in TV dramas and reality shows. The report comes as California implements an expanded film and TV tax credit program aimed at boosting local production and competing with other locations.</p>

The calculations show a noticeable decline in returns; for example, a 3-year CD opened in 2024 could have earned over $1,000 more than one opened today. Despite the drop, the article notes that current rates are still substantially higher than they were at the beginning of the 2020s.

          <p>The remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed in an attack in Laos in 1968, have been officially accounted for after 57 years. Hall was one of 11 American soldiers who died when their remote radio navigation site was overrun by Vietnamese commandos, and their bodies could not be recovered at the time. After multiple joint recovery missions spanning decades, remains found on the mountain site were identified using anthropological and DNA analysis. His identification brings long-awaited closure to his family, and he is scheduled for burial in Kansas.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, a newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch, escalating tensions in their long-standing political alliance. The lawsuit stems from an article reporting that Trump sent a lewd birthday message to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump vehemently denied the story, labeling it "Fake" and a "Scam" on social media before delivering the lawsuit. The legal action highlights the continuing political fallout from the Epstein case and creates a notable rift between Trump and a key conservative media figure.</p>

          <p>When questioned about developments in the Jeffrey Epstein case, President Trump deflected by attacking former President Barack Obama and promoting claims about politicized intelligence during the 2016 election. The Justice Department had just announced it would seek a meeting with Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell, a development Trump called "appropriate" while claiming to know little about it. He then urged reporters to focus on allegations against the Obama administration instead of the "nonsense" Epstein controversy. The exchange showcases Trump's strategy of using counter-accusations to divert attention from politically damaging topics.</p>

          <p>A recently passed bill has established a new student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), which will become available by July 2026. This income-driven plan calculates monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum payment. The plan offers forgiveness after 30 years and provides a $50 monthly credit for each qualifying dependent. As the legislation also phases out some existing repayment options, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers in the future.</p>

          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's policy toward Ukraine is inconsistent and ultimately unhelpful to its war effort against Russia. While the administration recently approved the transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems, it simultaneously gave Russia a 50-day grace period before considering new sanctions. The article suggests Trump is "stringing Ukraine along" by providing just enough aid to keep them engaged but not enough to secure a decisive victory. This approach, combined with Trump's past deference to Vladimir Putin, leaves Ukraine in a precarious position.</p>

The report found that 27% of workers have a second income stream, a significant drop from 36% in 2024. Analysts attribute the decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic pressure on individuals to take on extra work. This shift suggests that more people are feeling less financial anxiety, though it remains to be seen if the trend will continue. (not investment advice)</p>
