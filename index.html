          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in the Sean Combs trial, alleging severe violence and sexual assault during their nearly 11-year relationship, which she says led to PTSD. She recounted an incident where Combs allegedly dangled a friend over a balcony and another instance where he allegedly committed sexual assault in her living room. Ventura described the latter as feeling violated and recalls crying and saying no. She stated that she met with Combs one last time after the alleged sexual assault because she felt they were still very connected, and that she did not hate him.</p>

          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation revealed that Kroger shoppers are frequently overcharged for items marked on sale due to expired discount tags. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, found errors on over 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors represent only a small fraction of annual transactions, while analysts suggest the issue could damage consumer trust. The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger, as retailers like Walmart and Albertsons have faced similar allegations.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is delaying the timeline for water utilities to comply with reducing certain PFAS chemicals in drinking water and reconsidering the allowable levels for others. The compliance deadline is being extended to 2031 for PFOA and PFOS, and the limits for four other PFAS chemicals are being reconsidered. Environmental advocates have expressed skepticism, fearing the move provides relief in terms of cost to water systems, while groups representing water utilities praised the move. The EPA estimates that 6-10% of water systems serve water with excess PFAS levels, affecting around 100 million people in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is significantly cheaper than a personal loan, with average interest rates of 7.99% compared to 12.47% for personal loans. Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by using a HELOC, but they should calculate repayments carefully due to the variable interest rates. With potential rate cuts on the horizon, HELOC rates may decline further, making them an even more attractive option for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>
