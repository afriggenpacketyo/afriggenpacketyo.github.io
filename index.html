          <p>A new Republican tax bill, signed by President Trump, aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The legislation introduces several new provisions, including a "senior bonus," an increased state and local tax deduction, and a higher estate tax exemption. It also establishes tax breaks for tip income and overtime pay, and creates new tax-advantaged savings accounts for children. This comprehensive bill represents a significant overhaul of American financial policy, impacting a wide range of taxpayers across the country.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas's Hill Country over the July Fourth weekend have resulted in over 80 deaths, with many people, including summer campers, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, catching residents and visitors by surprise in the middle of the night. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the timing and adequacy of emergency warnings, citing the unpredictable nature of the "100-year-flood" event. The disaster has prompted a massive search and rescue operation and a federal disaster declaration as the community grapples with immense loss and destruction.</p>

          <p>A hiker who fell 26 feet into a crevasse on a Swiss glacier was saved thanks to the actions of his long-haired Chihuahua. After the man's distress call failed to pinpoint his location, a helicopter rescue team struggled to find him on the vast glacier. The breakthrough came when a rescuer spotted the tiny dog moving near the hole where its owner had fallen. The Air Zermatt rescue service credited the "four-legged hero" for remaining by the spot, stating its behavior was decisive in the successful and life-saving operation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that any country aligning with what he terms the "Anti-American policies of BRICS" will face an additional 10% tariff. This warning comes as the U.S. pushes trading partners to finalize new deals, with a deadline looming before increased tariffs are set to begin on August 1. The BRICS bloc, which recently expanded, has been critical of U.S. tariff policies, arguing they create global economic uncertainty. This move escalates trade tensions and pressures nations to choose between aligning with the U.S. or the emerging economic alliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his public attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, demanding significant interest rate cuts to spur the economy. However, economists note that the president's actual power over the independent central bank is limited by its structure. Interest rate decisions are made by a 12-member committee, not the chair alone, and Trump can only appoint a small fraction of its members in the near future. While the president's rhetoric is a departure from historical norms, the Fed's institutional independence is designed to resist such political pressure and prevent short-term policy whims from destabilizing the economy.</p>

          <p>Economists are calling for more decisive action from the Chinese government to address the country's persistent deflationary pressures and weak domestic demand. China's GDP deflator has been negative for over a year, and consumer prices have fallen for four consecutive months, signaling a concerning economic trend. Analysts from institutions like China International Capital Corporation argue that simply trimming industrial supply has been ineffective. They suggest the root cause is a downturn in the property and financial sectors combined with declining household income expectations, which requires a stronger policy response to stimulate demand.</p>

          <p>Huawei is defending its new Pangu Pro MoE artificial intelligence model as a home-grown creation following allegations that it was built upon a third-party model. A post on GitHub by an account named HonestAGI claimed the Huawei model showed an "extraordinary correlation" with an open-source model from Alibaba. Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab, which developed the model, stated that it was trained on Huawei's own Ascend AI chips and was not an incremental update to another company's work. The lab did acknowledge using some open-source codes from other models but asserted it followed all licensing requirements.</p>

          <p>Mexican prosecutors have alleged that former boxing champion Julio César Chávez Jr served as a henchman for the Sinaloa cartel, according to a recent indictment. The filing claims Chávez Jr was directed by a cartel leader to physically beat rival gang members who had been captured. This information reportedly came from intercepted phone calls and was revealed following his recent arrest in California by U.S. immigration officials for cartel affiliations and an active warrant in Mexico. Chávez Jr, who is currently facing deportation, has received unconditional support from his family, who maintain his innocence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent pressure on universities, including forcing the resignation of the University of Virginia's president over DEI policies, is part of a broader authoritarian strategy. This commentary argues that these actions, framed around issues like DEI and antisemitism, are excuses to gain control over higher education, a key independent source of information. The author compares this to Viktor Orbán's methods in Hungary, suggesting the ultimate goal is to create an "illiberal democracy." By attacking education, the administration aims to weaken a primary obstacle to tyranny: an educated and critically thinking populace.</p>

          <p>A federal trial is underway to challenge the Trump administration's policy of targeting foreign students for deportation based on their pro-Palestinian speech. The lawsuit, brought by academic associations, argues this "ideological-deportation policy" is unconstitutional and has created a climate of fear on campuses, chilling free speech for both citizen and noncitizen scholars. The government will have to defend its position that it can deport noncitizens whose presence it deems a threat to U.S. foreign policy, even without a criminal offense. The case represents a major legal test of First Amendment rights in the context of immigration.</p>

Prominent figures warn of a potential crisis of investor confidence in U.S. debt, which could have severe ripple effects on global markets.

          <p>The long-standing American model of accommodating population growth through suburban sprawl is becoming unsustainable, according to a new economic analysis. Even in the traditionally pro-growth Sunbelt, housing construction in suburbs has plummeted, causing prices to surge and mimicking the affordability crises of coastal cities. This suggests that relying on building ever-outward is a failing strategy. The article argues for a fundamental rethinking of the suburb, moving away from restrictive single-family zoning to allow for incremental densification, such as duplexes and small apartment buildings, to create more flexible, affordable, and sustainable communities.</p>

This opinion article argues that senators and representatives who defy Trump, like Thom Tillis who retired after opposing a bill, are systematically pushed out. The goal is not ideological consistency or party growth, but absolute loyalty and domination. By replacing dissenters with loyalists, or even allowing seats to flip to Democrats, Trump is purifying the party into a smaller, more compliant organism that values obedience above all else.</p>

The spurned artist transforms her show into a public takedown of Alex, creating a national sensation. Told from the perspective of his junior colleague, the novel explores the power, ego, and potential corruption inherent in the profession of criticism in a delightfully snackable narrative.</p>

Inspired by a childhood memory, the fries are tossed with fried herbs and a splash of balsamic vinegar, creating a unique flavor profile.
