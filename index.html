          <p>In Bulgaria, the arrest of Varna's reformist mayor, Blagomir Kotsev, on corruption charges has triggered widespread protests in multiple cities. Demonstrators and political analysts express concern that the country's conservative government is weaponizing the prosecutor's office to undermine political opponents and consolidate power. The article notes that these events coincide with a European Commission report highlighting a lack of improvement in Bulgaria's justice system. Protesters argue these actions threaten the nation's democracy and represent a trend toward authoritarianism, with some criticizing the EU's perceived silence on the matter.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old Little League player in New Jersey, suspended from a state tournament for a celebratory bat flip after a home run, has received support from major league players. The family sought a temporary restraining order, and a judge overturned the suspension, allowing the boy to play. New York Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. called the suspension "ridiculous," questioning why a child would be punished for having fun. Little League International expressed disappointment with the legal intervention, reiterating its focus on sportsmanship and respect for officials.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France title after maintaining his overall lead through the race's penultimate stage. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured his first-ever Tour stage victory with a solo attack 16 kilometers from the finish. Pogačar finished safely within the main group of riders, known as the peloton. With only the final, traditionally processional stage into Paris remaining, his commanding lead in the general classification is considered secure, barring any unforeseen accidents on the final day of the competition.</p>

          <p>Tom Rogers, a former NBC Cable President and self-proclaimed "raging bull" on Netflix, has tempered his optimism regarding the streaming giant's future. He points to declining viewer engagement per subscriber and increasing competition from free content platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. Rogers suggests that while Netflix still dominates in hit shows, the rise of AI tools could empower amateur creators on YouTube, blurring the line with professional content and further challenging Netflix's market share. Despite a strong quarterly report, these engagement trends are a worrisome sign for the company's long-term growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for Donald Trump's private visit, during which he played golf at his Turnberry resort. While the day at the resort was uneventful, hundreds of protesters gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to demonstrate against his politics, particularly his views on climate change and the conflict in Gaza. During his visit, Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has raised questions about security costs and drawn criticism over public funding for a golf tournament at his Aberdeenshire course.</p>

Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" argue the scandal's themes of powerful elites acting in secret directly contradict the anti-establishment narrative that forms the core of his connection with his base. By appearing to defend powerful interests, Trump risks alienating his key supporters in a way that previous controversies have not. This dynamic is a central reason why the story continues to gain traction and dominate political discourse.</p>

It suggests that reading in nature can be a form of play and a practice in sustained attention, sharpening one's perception of the surrounding environment. The piece argues that focusing on a book outside can enhance the experience of being in a park, a garden, or other open-air settings. To encourage this practice, the newsletter provides recommendations for books that are particularly well-suited for outdoor reading adventures, aiming to inspire readers to combine their love of literature with the outdoors.</p>

          <p>A U.S. research team has discovered the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in some reusable period products. The study, led by scientists at the University of Notre Dame, found that nearly a third of tested period underwear, menstrual cups, and reusable pads contained these toxic chemicals. Some products had levels high enough to indicate PFAS were intentionally used in manufacturing. These chemicals are linked to serious health issues, including cancer and fertility problems, and persist indefinitely in the environment, posing risks through both direct skin absorption and contamination of water cycles.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Justin Bieber's new song "Daisies" has become an unexpected contender for the song of the summer, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The track is from his surprise album "Swag," which departs from his previous pop sound for a more subtle, R&B-influenced style. Critics note the album's production is aqueous and muffled, creating a gentle and soothing feel that seems to resonate with the current cultural mood, which favors reserved, simmering music over high-energy party anthems. The song's success suggests a collective desire for stability and comfort over passion and heat.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a massive global health initiative, recently escaped a $400 million budget cut after the Senate rejected the administration's rescission request. While advocates are relieved, the program's future is far from secure, as its congressional authorization expired in March and the administration has proposed major cuts for the next fiscal year. Disruptions from earlier aid halts have already negatively impacted HIV treatment adherence in some regions. Experts note that while bipartisan support for PEPFAR seems to be re-emerging, its long-term funding, scope, and operational plans remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by breeding and releasing millions of mosquitoes engineered to combat the spread of dengue and other viruses. These "Wolbitos," developed by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, are infected with Wolbachia bacteria, which prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them. When these mosquitoes mate with the wild population, they pass the bacteria on, effectively making the local mosquito population harmless to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the Brazilian government to build a new factory to produce billions of the mosquitoes for nationwide deployment.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that Britain is working with Jordan to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, as international concern over the territory's catastrophic conditions intensifies. This comes as Israel stated it would permit such deliveries, though aid groups warn airdrops are insufficient. The move coincides with growing political pressure on the UK government to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a step recently committed to by France. Over 220 MPs, including a majority from the Labour party, have signed a letter advocating for recognition as a vital step toward a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual conversations can significantly improve their outcome. This brief moment of forethought allows you to consider topics, questions, and goals for the interaction, making you appear more prepared, considerate, and intelligent. The article explains that once a conversation begins, the brain is too cognitively busy with active listening and formulating responses to effectively brainstorm new talking points. This simple strategy can help build stronger relationships and make you more influential in both personal and professional settings.</p>

Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas were among the states at the bottom of the list, hindered by factors including poor weather scores due to natural disasters.
