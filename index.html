          <p>The United States has doubled the reward to $50 million for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom it accuses of being a major narco-trafficker. The Trump administration alleges Maduro works with cartels to flood the U.S. with drugs. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased reward as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate distraction. This action represents a significant escalation in the long-standing tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse reported mixed financial results for the second quarter, as strong customer traffic was offset by declining profitability due to high beef prices. While same-store sales grew, elevated commodity costs squeezed margins. In response, the company plans to implement a 1.7% menu price increase in the fourth quarter to help mitigate the ongoing inflationary pressures on its most critical ingredient.

          <p>China's major electric vehicle manufacturers are pulling back from a fierce price war, reducing steep discounts at the request of the Beijing government. This intervention is designed to stabilize the crucial automotive industry and prevent the damaging effects of intense, prolonged price competition. While this signals a truce, analysts note that the sector's underlying issue of overcapacity may mean that competitive pricing pressures will continue in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction that restricts certain immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California. The ban on so-called "roving patrols" was put in place after a federal judge found that agents were likely violating the 4th Amendment by apprehending individuals based on factors like race or language. The administration argues the restrictions severely hamper its ability to enforce immigration laws.</p>
