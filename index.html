          <p>While Beijing hosted a major military parade for the 80th anniversary of its WWII victory, China's navy conducted routine patrols in the disputed South China Sea. A spokesperson for the Southern Theatre Command stated the forces were on high alert to protect China's sovereignty and maritime interests, describing the patrol as a deterrence. This military posturing occurred shortly after the conclusion of joint drills in the region by the Philippines, Australia, and Canada, highlighting ongoing tensions and strategic maneuvers in the contested waters.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust case, a federal judge ruled against breaking up Google but barred the company from making exclusive deals that set its search engine as the default on devices like smartphones. The Department of Justice had sued Google in 2020, arguing its practices constituted an illegal monopoly, and sought remedies including the spinoff of its Chrome browser. The ruling acknowledges Google's monopoly power but opts for behavioral restrictions rather than structural separation, a decision with major implications for competition in search and artificial intelligence.</p>

The French boxing federation stated that the lab recommended by World Boxing could not deliver the results in time, calling the situation stupefying and an indignation. World Boxing, the sport's governing body, placed the responsibility on national federations for managing the testing process, expressing disappointment that some athletes were excluded due to their federation's administrative failures.</p>

          <p>According to a classified Israeli military database, only about a quarter of the 6,000 Palestinians from Gaza detained under Israel's "unlawful combatants" law are identified as fighters. A joint investigation reveals that the vast majority of those held indefinitely without charge or trial are civilians, including medical workers, teachers, and children. The report highlights changes in detention laws since the conflict began, such as extending the time a person can be held without access to a lawyer, raising concerns about human rights.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a large majority of Americans, across party lines, believe the government should make vaccines more available for those who want them. However, a significant portion of respondents think Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies are actively making them less accessible. The survey also indicates that while trust in the FDA and CDC is partisan, Americans overwhelmingly trust their own doctors for medical information regarding vaccine safety.</p>

          <p>Recent actions by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including restricting COVID vaccine access and overhauling a key CDC advisory panel, are seen as part of a broader effort to dismantle the nation's vaccine infrastructure. While the current childhood immunization schedule remains largely intact, these policy shifts are fracturing the pipeline from vaccine development to public access, creating a precedent for future changes. This has led to a patchwork response, with some states forming alliances to coordinate recommendations while others move to end all vaccine mandates.</p>

Critics argue the policy is substantively flawed, as it arbitrarily benefits certain workers over others, disproportionately helps higher earners, and encourages tax avoidance. Furthermore, it risks entrenching an inefficient and inequitable compensation system based on tips rather than stable wages, potentially harming the very workers it purports to help.

          <p>Stacey Williams, a former model who dated Jeffrey Epstein in 1993, is publicly calling for the full release of government files related to the convicted sex offender. In an op-ed, Williams recounts how Epstein facilitated an encounter where she was groped by Donald Trump and later told her he had secretly filmed her, experiences she says highlight the need for transparency. She argues that releasing the files is not a partisan issue but a matter of justice for the hundreds of victims who deserve accountability and healing.</p>

          <p>FIFA has confirmed it will use a dynamic pricing model for the 2026 World Cup, allowing ticket prices to fluctuate based on market demand after their initial sale. This move, a first for the tournament, has drawn criticism for effectively enabling price-gouging and making the event less accessible to average fans. While FIFA claims the strategy helps optimize revenue to fund global soccer development, critics argue it betrays the sport's spirit by prioritizing profit at all costs over fan experience.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man, who identified himself as "Michael the Angel of Death," has been charged with multiple felonies after allegedly threatening a Catholic monastery in Orange County and traveling there with a large cache of weapons. Authorities say Joshua Michael Richardson sent threatening emails before showing up at St. Michael's Abbey, telling a priest he was there to "do the Lord's reaping." Investigators found numerous weapons in his truck, and he is now being held without bail due to the serious danger he poses.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study on Los Angeles's parks system has been released for public comment, outlining strategies to reverse decades of neglect and underfunding. The report finds that L.A. invests significantly less per capita in its parks than other major cities, leading to poor conditions and limited access for many residents. The city is now considering new funding mechanisms, such as a ballot measure, and smarter resource allocation to revitalize the roughly 500 parks that serve as essential community spaces.</p>

The proposed laws would require officials to notify families of raids on campuses and bar immigration agents from nonpublic areas without a judicial warrant. These measures aim to ensure that schools and healthcare facilities remain safe spaces where all residents, regardless of immigration status, can access essential services without fear of detention or deportation.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, California schools are navigating new procedures to allow parents to opt their children out of lessons on LGBTQ+ issues that conflict with their religious beliefs. School districts are developing notification systems and alternative assignments, though educators express concern about the administrative burden and the potential for creating a non-inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ students. The ruling has prompted conservative groups to distribute template opt-out letters, while teachers' unions affirm their commitment to teaching state-approved, inclusive curriculum.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates progress in addressing homelessness in Los Angeles County, with a 14% decrease in people living on the streets over two years. However, this positive trend is at risk due to significant funding cuts from state and federal sources, compounded by slowing local tax revenue. Homeless service providers are already feeling the impact, with layoffs and the suspension of new applicants for rental subsidy programs, which could reverse the recent gains and make it harder to move people into permanent housing.</p>

She warns that a politicized Fed could lead to a loss of confidence, higher inflation, and increased costs for mortgages and loans for American families. (not investment advice)</p>

Decades of research confirm that creatine monohydrate can help build lean muscle mass and improve athletic performance, particularly in activities requiring short bursts of energy. While generally considered safe for adults, experts recommend choosing products certified by third-party programs to avoid adulterants. Evidence for other touted benefits, such as cognitive boosts and improved bone health, is still emerging and requires more scientific data.</p>
