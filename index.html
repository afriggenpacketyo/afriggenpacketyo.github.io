        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to an expedited hearing for the Trump administration's appeal concerning the legality of its widespread tariffs. The case, set for oral arguments in November, challenges lower court rulings that found the president overstepped his authority. The administration argued for the fast-tracked timeline, warning that a delayed negative ruling could force the Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion in collected duties. At stake are tariffs affecting nearly 70% of all goods imported into the U.S., which were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p>

          <p>A Michigan judge has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans accused of acting as false electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The group faced felony counts, including forgery, for signing a document claiming to be the state's official electors despite Joe Biden's victory. District Court Judge Kristen D. Simmons's decision prevents the case from proceeding to trial, marking a significant setback for prosecutors. Similar legal challenges against alleged fake electors are ongoing with various delays and procedural issues in states like Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona.</p>

The surge was driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business, fueled by major AI-related contracts, including one with OpenAI. Oracle reported its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue, has grown to $455 billion. The company forecasted substantial growth in its cloud revenue, projecting it to reach $144 billion by fiscal year 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog to discuss the "intolerable situation in Gaza." The meeting comes after Israel conducted a strike against Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, and as Israel prepares for a ground offensive in Gaza City. Some UK parliamentarians have called for Herzog to be denied entry, citing allegations of war crimes, which Israel denies. Downing Street stated Starmer will emphasize the need to end the suffering in Gaza, while also condemning the recent Israeli strike in Qatar for violating its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Key inflation reports for August, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), are anticipated to show a monthly increase of 0.3%. This would push the annual headline CPI rate to 2.9%, largely due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on goods. However, economists believe the Federal Reserve will likely proceed with an interest rate cut next week. The reasoning is that the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, is expected to remain stable, and the price hikes are not seen as indicative of long-term, systemic inflation.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly engaged with William Parker, a researcher promoting a fringe theory that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a primary cause of autism. This development aligns with Kennedy's promise to identify the cause of autism by September, a pledge that has been met with skepticism by the scientific community. Parker, whose work has been largely rejected by mainstream science, claims his theory is now being taken seriously by top health officials, including NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya. The focus on Tylenol marks a potential shift from Kennedy's long-standing, debunked claims linking vaccines to autism.</p>

If convicted on all charges, Bolsonaro, who denies the allegations, could face over 40 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Heimir Hallgrimsson, the manager of the Republic of Ireland's national football team, has taken full responsibility for the team's unexpected 2-1 loss to Armenia in a World Cup qualifying match. The defeat leaves Ireland at the bottom of their group with only one point from two games, severely damaging their qualification hopes. Hallgrimsson acknowledged that the performance was poor in nearly every aspect and admitted his position as manager will now face scrutiny. The team's next match is a difficult away fixture against group leaders Portugal.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Sébastien Lecornu, his 39-year-old defense minister, as the new prime minister. The appointment comes just a day after the previous government, led by François Bayrou, was ousted in a no-confidence vote over its proposed budget cuts. Lecornu, a loyal ally of Macron, is now the fourth prime minister in just over a year and faces the immediate challenge of navigating a hung parliament to pass a budget and tackle France's significant public debt. His appointment has already drawn criticism from both left-wing and far-right opposition leaders.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has quickly appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new manager, just hours after the departure of Nuno Espirito Santo.

          <p>A massive immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant construction site in Georgia, which resulted in the detention of nearly 500 workers, is signaling a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on companies employing undocumented labor. The operation was the largest single-site enforcement action in DHS history. The incident is prompting foreign companies to reassess their U.S. investments and workforce composition, potentially creating a chilling effect on foreign investment. The White House has stated that while it welcomes foreign investment, it expects these companies to prioritize hiring and training American workers.</p>

          <p>The White House has criticized Israel's strike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, stating the action "does not advance Israel or America's goals." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump "feels very badly" about the location of the attack on a key U.S. ally that is actively involved in peace negotiations. The administration claims it was notified by the U.S. military just before the strike occurred but repeatedly avoided confirming if Israel had provided a direct warning. Trump reportedly assured Qatar's leaders that such an incident would not happen again on their soil, exposing rare public friction between the U.S. and Israel.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement, mediated by Egypt, to resume cooperation on inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. This development comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN watchdog following an air war with Israel and the U.S. in June. The agreement also occurs as European nations are moving to reimpose sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. The IAEA has expressed serious concern over its inability to verify Iran's stockpile of near bomb-grade uranium since the conflict began.</p>
