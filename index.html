          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a temporary pause to a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, providing the administration with some reprieve. The Trump administration plans to seek "emergency relief" from the Supreme Court if the ruling isn't quickly paused, alleging the trade court judges are biased and undermining the United States' credibility. The appeals court has given plaintiffs one week to respond to the administration's bid for a stay pending appeal, with the U.S. having until June 9 to reply. The initial trade court panel had invalidated Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs, stating the 1970s-era law used didn't grant such broad presidential authority, leading to criticism from White House officials.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has seen a remarkable surge, consistently remaining in the $3,300 range after starting January 2024 at around $2,000 per ounce. Investors should monitor upcoming economic reports in June that could influence gold prices, specifically the unemployment report on June 6, the inflation report on June 11, and the Federal Reserve meeting on June 18. Declining unemployment or inflation rates could cause gold's price to decline, while an uptick in inflation or comments made by Federal Reserve officials could cause gold's price to rise. Given the difficulty of precisely timing the gold market, investors should consider limited and cost-effective investments now and monitor these dates for further opportunities (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies' shares rose 10% after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and issued a stronger-than-expected forecast for the current quarter, attributing the strong guidance to $7 billion in artificial intelligence systems expected to ship during the quarter. The company expects $2.25 in adjusted earnings per share for the current quarter, with between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion in revenue. Dell is experiencing "unprecedented demand" for AI systems, particularly from second-tier cloud providers like Coreweave, and has $14.4 billion in confirmed AI orders in its backlog. Dell also significantly increased its shareholder capital return, spending $2.4 billion on share repurchases and dividends during the quarter.</p>

          <p>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred described the decision to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list as difficult but ultimately necessary to uphold agreements. Manfred cited three factors driving the decision: the list effectively bans working in the game, Rose is part of baseball history, and Rose's original settlement agreement allowed Hall of Fame consideration. Rose died at age 83 in September 2024, but the debate about his Hall of Fame eligibility has persisted. Rose, MLB’s hit king with 4,256 career hits, received a lifetime ban in 1989 due to gambling on games, but will now be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration.</p>

          <p>The White House has acknowledged problems in a report spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., titled “Make America Healthy Again,” which criticized America's food supply, pesticides, and prescription drugs. The report cited hundreds of studies, but some of those studies did not actually exist, leading to the White House promising to update the report. Despite the errors, the White House maintains complete confidence in Kennedy, describing the report as a transformative health assessment.</p>

          <p>Americans who missed the 2024 tax filing deadline should take immediate action to mitigate potential penalties and interest from the IRS. Key questions to address include whether a tax extension was filed, the amount owed, and the availability of necessary tax documents. Taxpayers should also assess their risk of IRS penalties or enforcement action and consider whether working with a tax professional could simplify the process and reduce costs. Filing, even late, opens the door to payment plans and penalty relief (not investment advice).</p>

This target was delivered to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) leaders by Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem, indicating increasing pressure to increase arrests of immigrants. The crackdown includes tactics such as mandating federal law enforcement agents outside Ice to assist in arrests, deputizing state and local law enforcement, and arresting people at courthouses. This has led to concerns about due process, overcrowding in detention centers, and the co-opting of federal agents from normal priorities.</p>

Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog, described the announcement as the most extensive move of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords.
