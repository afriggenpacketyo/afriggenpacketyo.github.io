          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. The move aims to satisfy calls from the US for increased allied spending while providing EU countries with flexibility. Critics argue that the announcement lacks immediate funding, given current geopolitical threats, but the government defends the long-term strategy as vital for economic and national security. The commitment demonstrates a proactive approach to evolving global challenges.</p>

Advocates warn that these requirements will increase uninsurance and medical debt without boosting employment, citing examples from Arkansas and Georgia. The proposed changes would require able-bodied adults to work, volunteer, or attend an education program at least 80 hours a month. Opponents argue that the requirements create bureaucratic hurdles and disproportionately affect older adults, people with disabilities, and caregivers.</p>

          <p>A new EU report reveals that over 20% of Europeans are exposed to unhealthy levels of noise pollution, mainly from road traffic. Long-term exposure to traffic noise is linked to cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and premature death, with children being particularly vulnerable. The report estimates that 112 million people live with traffic noise louder than 55 dB, impacting health and productivity. Experts recommend reducing traffic, lowering speed limits, and promoting public transport to mitigate noise pollution.</p>

          <p>A brutal heat wave has settled in across the eastern United States, with record-high temperatures forecast for this week. Temperatures will soar to 15-25 degrees above average, with some areas experiencing heat index readings of 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Over 160 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with another 40 million under heat advisories. The heat wave is caused by a heat dome, and climate change is making extreme temperatures more frequent and longer-lasting.</p>

          <p>A US marine was sentenced to seven years in prison by a court in Japan after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman in Okinawa last year. The case is one of several involving US service members in Okinawa, where more than half of the 54,000 US soldiers serving in Japan are based. The court described the attack as "vicious," with the woman being choked for one to two minutes. Local opposition to US bases in Okinawa extends beyond criminal cases to include aircraft noise and pollution.</p>
