          <p>Nintendo has reported record sales of over 3.5 million units for its new Switch 2 console in the first four days following its launch, surpassing initial expectations and setting a new benchmark for the company. This performance positions the Switch 2 favorably to meet its target of selling 15 million units within the fiscal year ending March 2026. The enthusiastic response from fans worldwide indicates the upgraded console's appeal as a versatile gaming system for both home and on-the-go use. Despite the positive sales figures, Nintendo's stock experienced a slight dip, but overall, the company has seen significant growth since the original Switch's debut. The new console's success hinges on maintaining the momentum of its predecessor, which became one of Nintendo's best-selling devices. Optimism surrounding the console's future is high due to its innovative features and strong market demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Asian countries are increasingly moving away from reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties and a desire to reduce FX risks. This trend, known as de-dollarization, is driven by concerns that the dollar could be used as leverage in trade negotiations or sanctions. ASEAN nations are promoting the use of local currencies in trade and investment, while the BRICS nations are developing alternative payment systems to bypass traditional dollar-dependent systems like SWIFT. Countries with substantial foreign assets, such as Singapore and South Korea, are also exploring repatriating earnings to their home currencies, further contributing to the de-dollarization trend. The dollar's dominance is gradually being challenged as Asian economies seek greater financial autonomy.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is facing a confidence vote in parliament after a recent presidential election defeat. The vote was called by Tusk himself in an effort to rally support for his pro-European coalition, which has struggled to implement key reforms due to opposition from the outgoing president. Critics argue that Tusk's government has achieved little since coming to power, and opposition leaders are seizing the moment to challenge his leadership. The outcome of the vote will determine Tusk's future as prime minister and the direction of Polish politics.</p>

The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to sterilize people with disabilities without consent to prevent the birth of "inferior" offspring.

          <p>A recent report by PwC suggests that the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence may diminish the value of formal college degrees. The report indicates that employer demand for degrees is declining faster in AI-exposed fields, as AI tools enable individuals to acquire expert knowledge more rapidly. Skills are becoming more critical than degrees, particularly in occupations heavily influenced by AI, and workers are encouraged to upskill in AI to future-proof their careers. This shift could democratize opportunities for those who lack the resources for formal education.</p>

Jane, Diddy's ex-girlfriend, testified about his lifestyle, including alleged drug use and voyeuristic fantasies, which some believe are overshadowing the core charges of coercion versus consent. While the testimony paints a negative picture of Diddy's character, it may not directly prove the federal charges he faces. The case hinges on whether Jane willingly participated in the alleged acts or was coerced, with the defense suggesting she chose to participate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. defense sector is heavily dependent on critical minerals, particularly rare earth elements, for its advanced weapon systems, with China dominating the global supply and processing of these materials. This reliance poses a growing risk to U.S. military readiness and supply chain security, especially as Beijing tightens export restrictions. Many of the applications for these materials have no substitutes, meaning that Chinese export restrictions make the US defence industry supply chain more vulnerable by limiting material supply and by blocking access to separation and refining technology critical to building independent US capacity.</p>
