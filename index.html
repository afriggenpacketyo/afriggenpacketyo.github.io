          <p>The man who killed four people in a Manhattan office shooting had a valid Nevada concealed carry permit, despite a history of mental health incidents. He legally purchased a handgun in Las Vegas and acquired an AR-15-style rifle through a private sale from a coworker. The incident has reignited the debate over gun control, highlighting how state-specific laws are ineffective against shooters traveling across state lines. New York's governor called for a national assault weapons ban, but political division and legal precedents continue to make federal legislation difficult to enact.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This change, effective in 2026, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall. The determination of background will be based on parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, as the government seeks to diversify its workforce and ensure it better reflects the country it serves. This initiative is part of a broader effort to move civil service roles outside of London.</p>

The execution proceeded after the Supreme Court denied a final request for a stay. Florida has now carried out more executions than any other state in the current year, with two more scheduled.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom to be constructed in the White House's East Wing. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, not by taxpayers. With a capacity for 650 seated guests, the new venue is intended to host major state functions without the need for temporary tents. Construction is scheduled to begin in September and will replace the current East Wing, which was originally built in 1902 and has undergone numerous renovations.</p>

During an earnings call, Cook emphasized that Apple is "very open" to mergers and acquisitions of any size that can accelerate its AI roadmap, confirming seven smaller company acquisitions this year. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower than competitors like Google and Meta, the company is reallocating staff and using a hybrid investment model to enhance its AI capabilities.

The original test, dating back to the 1950s, was designed to assess student fitness through exercises like pull-ups and a one-mile run. The new order directs the council, to be chaired by golfer Bryson DeChambeau, to develop strategies for reviving the test and promoting physical education to combat childhood obesity. This move aims to foster a new generation of healthy citizens and address what the administration terms a national security threat posed by sedentary lifestyles.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers opted for a conservative approach at the MLB trade deadline, making modest additions rather than blockbuster deals. The team acquired veteran reliever Brock Stewart from the Minnesota Twins and outfielder Alex Call from the Washington Nationals to address bullpen and defensive needs. Unlike other National League contenders who made significant acquisitions, the Dodgers' front office expressed confidence in their existing roster to defend their World Series title. The team is betting on the return of injured players and improved performance from its star hitters to carry them through the remainder of the season.</p>

This defense comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use competitor VantageScore for the first time, a move Lansing claims raises "safety and soundness concerns."

Authorities attribute the spike to land-grabbing for pastures, illegal construction, expansion of illicit crop cultivation, and wildfires intensified by climate change.

          <p>In a rare public appearance, three federal judges detailed the escalating threats and harassment they have faced, which they link to political rhetoric and rulings against the Trump administration. The judges described receiving credible death threats, being targeted by false emergency calls known as "swatting," and receiving unsolicited pizzas sent in the name of a murdered judge's son. They spoke of a "daunting" and "frightening" environment that has shaken their faith in the rule of law. The judges called on political leaders to tone down inflammatory language that they believe emboldens people to threaten the judiciary.</p>

          <p>During a public hearing, Texas lawmakers heard emotional testimony from survivors of the deadly July 4 floods, who criticized local officials for a disorganized response. The hearing revealed that key emergency management leaders in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, were either ill, asleep, or out of town as the unpredicted floodwaters rose. Local officials cited communication failures due to poor cell service in the remote region. Survivors spoke of losing family members and criticized the lack of effective warning systems, while lawmakers questioned the apparent confusion and inaction at the local level.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stated that Israel is in danger of international isolation due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which he described as "beyond imagination." Speaking from Jerusalem, he emphasized Germany's responsibility to prevent this isolation and urged Israel to allow sufficient aid into the territory to avert mass deaths. His comments came as a U.S. envoy prepared to visit Gaza to assess the aid situation. The article also notes that far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir accused Germany of supporting Nazism in response to the diplomatic pressure.</p>

          <p>Following a Los Angeles Times investigation, a city councilmember has introduced a motion to compel the city to comply with a 2019 state law requiring an analysis of its emergency evacuation routes. The law mandates that local governments assess the capacity, safety, and viability of these routes, but L.A.'s public plans lack this analysis. The motion calls for a report on evacuation routes in high-risk areas, including assessments for wildfire and tsunami scenarios. The city's planning department had previously cited terrorism concerns as a reason for not publicizing the routes, a claim the law's author called dubious.</p>

          <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an activist group, has alleged that American labor organizer Chris Smalls was physically assaulted by Israeli soldiers after an aid ship he was on was intercepted. Smalls, a co-founder of the Amazon Labor Union, was aboard the Handala, which was attempting to breach Israel's blockade to deliver supplies to Gaza. The coalition claims that Smalls, the only Black person on the boat, was choked and kicked while in custody. The Israeli foreign ministry denied the claim, stating that the passenger violently resisted and that the incident was a planned provocation for media attention.</p>

          <p>A powerful storm system has prompted states of emergency in New York City and New Jersey, bringing torrential rain and dangerous flash flooding to the U.S. East Coast.

Officials urged residents in flood-prone areas to take precautions and avoid travel. The severe weather also caused significant flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the region, from Washington D.C. to New York, as the storm system moved through.</p>

          <p>England pace bowler Chris Woakes is expected to miss the remainder of the decisive fifth Test match against India after suffering a shoulder injury on the opening day. Woakes was injured while attempting to stop a boundary, landing awkwardly and leaving the field in visible discomfort. The injury is a significant blow to England's already depleted bowling attack, which is missing several key players. At 36, and with a history of injuries, the incident raises concerns about the veteran player's future in international cricket, particularly ahead of the upcoming Ashes tour.</p>
