          <p>Former President Joe Biden expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support he received following his recent cancer diagnosis, including a private letter from King Charles. Biden's office disclosed that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. Despite the seriousness of the diagnosis, Biden's office indicated that the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. The former president said that his diagnosis was made after he reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate.</p>

Despite the contract's value being less than his college NIL valuation, the agreement provides Sanders with security as he competes for a roster spot in a crowded quarterback room.

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a race to determine why our Universe exists, as the current theory cannot explain the presence of planets, stars, and galaxies. A U.S.-led international collaboration is building the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota, while a Japanese team is constructing Hyper-K, a larger version of their existing neutrino detector. Both experiments aim to study neutrinos and anti-neutrinos to understand why matter won out over antimatter. The teams hope their discoveries will transform humanity's understanding of the Universe.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call with President Trump, Vladimir Putin reportedly agreed to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, although he reiterated demands for broad concessions. The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to remove deportation protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants pending appeal. Experts suggest Joe Bidenâ€™s prostate cancer diagnosis, announced recently, is serious but manageable with current medical advancements. Miami's public schools are integrating artificial intelligence technologies into teaching and learning, marking a shift from previous concerns about cheating and misinformation.</p>
