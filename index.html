          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10 with metastasis to the bone, but is hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick disclosed on "The Pivot" podcast that he once spent $5,000 on special milk requested by Antonio Brown for Tom Brady when Brown briefly played for the New England Patriots. The milk, intended to nurture the relationship between Brady and Brown, went bad after a mailroom mix-up. Belichick approved the expense to avoid damaging the connection between the two players, who later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick, now a college football coach, shared this anecdote from his book to highlight the importance of maintaining star player relationships.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering Trump v CASA, a case that could redefine birthright citizenship as granted by the 14th Amendment. The central issue is whether the amendment's promise of citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in America applies to children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa-holders. A ruling against current interpretations could reshape American citizenship laws.</p>
