          <p>A major US immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, predominantly South Korean citizens. Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated the individuals were working illegally, having violated the terms of their short-term visitor visas. The raid is part of an ongoing criminal investigation, sparking diplomatic concern from South Korea, which has called for its citizens' rights to be respected while promising to cooperate with authorities. This action highlights the administration's focus on enforcing workplace immigration laws to protect American jobs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that for a new world order, potentially led by Asian powers like those in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), to succeed, it must be supported by robust multilateral institutions similar to the post-war Bretton Woods system. The author contends that while political declarations of cooperation are a start, they are insufficient without new frameworks for international monetary, economic, and trade systems. The piece suggests that the growing influence of the 27-nation SCO bloc presents an opportunity to build these structures, warning that failure to do so could lead to further global fragmentation.</p>

          <p>A significant fire occurred at the BBC's former Television Centre headquarters in White City, west London, requiring about 100 firefighters and 15 fire engines to control the blaze. The fire, which started in a restaurant within the redeveloped building, led to the evacuation of residents from the complex, which now includes flats, restaurants, and active television studios. While there were no reported casualties, the incident caused considerable disruption, with emergency services closing nearby roads and setting up a rest center for those displaced. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of the Emperor, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, making him the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the 19-year-old is now second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his ascension to adulthood has reignited the national debate over the country's male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, there are growing concerns about the future of the world's oldest continuous monarchy. This event brings renewed focus to the rule that prevents female royals, like Princess Aiko, from inheriting the throne.</p>

          <h2>Bauhaus Dessau Marks Centennial Amidst Political Pressure from Germany's Far-Right</h2>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is shadowed by political attacks from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has criticized the movement's 'globalist uniformity' and attempted to force a critical reassessment, echoing the Nazi party's denunciation of Bauhaus as 'degenerate art' before shutting it down in 1933. Despite these pressures, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its celebration, focusing on the evolution of modern materials and societal impact, while forming alliances to counter the rising culture wars.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C. to address crime has ignited a fierce political debate between congressional Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have criticized the move as an unnecessary and embarrassing militarization of the nation's capital, particularly since it was not requested by local officials. Conversely, Republicans argue the presence of troops has made the city safer and question why their opponents do not support enhanced security measures. The deployment follows the federalization of the local police force and has prompted a lawsuit from the D.C. Attorney General to remove the troops.</p>

          <p>According to research from Oxford Economics, China's current campaign against 'involution,' or destructive price competition, is unlikely to produce the same large-scale impact as the supply-side reforms of 2015. While President Xi Jinping's recent criticism of low-quality price wars has raised investor hopes for a major economic shift, analysts believe the current environment is less conducive to decisive action. The firm suggests that delivering a combination of significant production capacity cuts and meaningful demand-side stimulus is far more challenging now, tempering expectations for a swift resolution to China's supply-demand imbalances.

          <p>France is facing significant economic turmoil as its public debt has swelled to approximately €3.35 trillion, or 113% of its GDP, the highest absolute amount in the EU. The current minority government's inability to pass budget-cutting measures has heightened market anxiety, reflected in higher borrowing costs compared to Germany. This political deadlock and fiscal pressure in the eurozone's second-largest economy are sparking fears of a potential debt crisis that could impact the stability of the entire single currency area, as unions call for a general strike.

          <p>The resignation of UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and the ensuing cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer have dominated British newspaper front pages. The Daily Mail described the events as a 'Nightmare on Downing Street,' reflecting a view of a government in 'meltdown.' Other papers, like The Times and The Guardian, framed the reshuffle as a 'big gamble' and an attempt by Starmer to restore order amid falling poll numbers and the rise of Reform UK. Commentators noted that while the row damages the government, Rayner's absence will be a significant blow to Labour's connection with certain voters.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech describing President Donald Trump as a 'risk taker' with an 'iron-clad stomach' who correctly identified widespread public anxieties. The speech is seen as an attempt to fortify the UK-US special relationship and counter the rising influence of Nigel Farage's Reform party, which mirrors Trump's agenda. In a notable shift, Mandelson, a prominent anti-Brexit campaigner, will also cast Brexit as a liberating force that has freed Britain to pursue closer ties with the US, a move interpreted as a pragmatic adaptation to the current political landscape.</p>

          <p>Yi Huiman, who served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) until February 2024, is under investigation for 'severe breaches of discipline.' The probe by the Communist Party's top anti-graft agency marks the latest development in a sweeping anti-corruption campaign that has increasingly targeted the nation's financial sector. As the former head of the watchdog for China's US$12 trillion capital market, Yi is the second top regulator to face such an investigation in the past decade. The term 'disciplinary breaches' is often used officially to refer to suspected corruption or economic crimes. (not investment advice)</p>

Direct impacts, including heavy rainfall and potential flooding, could begin as early as Monday. In response to the threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency to facilitate preparations for the storm's potential arrival.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has labeled a report claiming it will link Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism as 'speculation.' The statement came after the Wall Street Journal reported that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. planned such an announcement. Medical experts and organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintain there is no conclusive evidence of a causal link, emphasizing that research is conflicting and the causes of autism are complex. Tylenol's maker, Kenvue, also stated that it believes there is no causal connection based on continuous evaluation of scientific data.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, as demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with leaders from the world's four other ruling communist parties. This diplomatic channel, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, operates in parallel with traditional state-level foreign relations. While Beijing is not promoting a global communist movement like the former Soviet Union, these interactions are a key part of its foreign policy strategy. The International Department has become an increasingly important tool for China, helping to build connections with over 600 political parties worldwide and expanding its diplomatic reach.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Pyrite fire, ignited near Jurupa Valley in California's Inland Empire, quickly growing to 200 acres and forcing evacuations in the communities of Jurupa Hills and Sunnyslope. Nearly 300 firefighting personnel, supported by helicopters and water tenders, were deployed to combat the blaze, which burned in light fuels and spread toward the San Bernardino County border. An evacuation center was established at a local high school for affected residents. Authorities have closed nearby roads to allow emergency crews access as they work to contain the fire's progression.</p>
