        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest round of U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration is increasing the cost of essential building materials and home goods, such as kitchen cabinets and furniture. This adds another layer of financial pressure on the already fragile American housing market, affecting homebuyers, builders, and renovators. Economists warn that these new levies, on top of previous tariffs on steel and copper, could slow construction and exacerbate affordability issues for consumers. Many businesses, from large retailers like IKEA to smaller design galleries, are feeling the impact through rising material costs and consumer uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect, identified as 49-year-old Billy Cagle, was taken into custody unarmed inside the terminal. Authorities later found an AR-15 rifle with ammunition in his truck parked outside. Officials praised the family's quick action and the coordinated law enforcement response for preventing a potential tragedy at the world's busiest airport.

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be incarcerated, starting a five-year sentence for conspiring to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The 70-year-old entered Paris's La Santé prison while maintaining his innocence and vowing to appeal the conviction. Sarkozy will be held in the prison's isolation wing for his safety, with limited contact and one hour of daily exercise. The event has drawn significant public and political attention in France, with President Macron acknowledging the gravity of a former leader being jailed.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, with adjusted earnings per share at 82 cents versus the anticipated 78 cents. Despite the positive financial results, the company noted that overall consumer demand remains soft, with unit case volume seeing only a 1% increase globally. Key markets like North America and Latin America showed flat volume growth, indicating that lower-income consumers may be cutting back. The company maintained its full-year forecast, projecting a 5% to 6% rise in organic revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance has arrived in Israel to engage in high-level talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials, aiming to stabilize the delicate ceasefire with Hamas. The visit is focused on advancing negotiations to the next phase and securing the release of remaining hostages. This diplomatic effort comes after a weekend of renewed violence threatened the truce, with both sides accusing each other of violations. Concurrently, humanitarian organizations like the UN World Food Programme are stressing the urgent need for the ceasefire to hold to allow sufficient aid to enter Gaza, where famine is a growing threat.</p>

          <p>The posthumous release of Virginia Giuffre's memoir, "Nobody's Girl," has intensified pressure on Prince Andrew, detailing her alleged sexual encounters with him when she was a minor. The book's launch coincides with a parliamentary motion by the Scottish National Party to formally strip him of his "Duke of York" title. Giuffre, a victim of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, describes being directed by Ghislaine Maxwell to have sexual contact with the prince. Despite settling a lawsuit with Giuffre in 2022 and renouncing his titles, Andrew continues to face public condemnation and calls to fully cooperate with investigators.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a participant in the January 6th Capitol riot who was pardoned by former President Trump, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to assassinate House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to court documents, Moynihan sent text messages detailing his plan to "eliminate" Jeffries at an event in New York City. This arrest highlights growing concerns about recidivism among the more than 1,500 pardoned rioters and contributes to a rising wave of threats against members of Congress.

          <p>The rapid construction of power-intensive data centers, fueled by the AI boom, is contributing to rising electricity bills for households across the United States. Energy demand from these facilities is projected to more than double by 2035, and the rush by tech companies to secure future power capacity is already increasing current energy prices. In Maryland, a consumer advocate has asked the regional grid operator to address this "land rush," arguing that ratepayers are unfairly funding infrastructure for speculative data center projects that may never be built. This situation highlights a growing conflict between the tech industry's expansion and consumer energy affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research shows that black garden ants actively alter their nest architecture to reduce the transmission of a lethal fungus. When exposed to the pathogen, the ants build more compartmentalized nests with fewer interconnections and more distant entrances, effectively creating a form of "architectural immunity." This structural change complements their known social distancing behaviors, such as self-isolation by infected individuals, to protect the colony's most valuable members like the queen and larvae. Scientists suggest these findings demonstrate how a social species can manipulate its environment to combat epidemics, offering potential insights for designing human spaces that better control disease spread.</p>

According to sources, the CIA is providing real-time satellite and signals intelligence to identify and track vessels believed to be carrying narcotics from Venezuela, which are then targeted by U.S. military aircraft. This involvement means that the evidence used to justify these strikes will likely remain classified, raising concerns about transparency and the legal basis for using deadly force against civilian targets on the high seas.

The piece details the loss of friends and family, the destruction of infrastructure like schools and hospitals, and the suspended futures of young people. It powerfully conveys that for Palestinians in Gaza, a ceasefire is simply the beginning of a different kind of war—one of memory, grief, and an uncertain reconstruction.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that former President Trump's recent Gaza peace agreement has unexpectedly frustrated the ambitions of Israel's far-right, who had anticipated his support for their goals. The plan explicitly rejects Israeli resettlement or territorial claims in Gaza, a direct blow to hardline members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition who advocate for such outcomes. This follows Trump's earlier declaration against Israeli annexation of the West Bank, actions taken to preserve the Abraham Accords. The author suggests that while Trump has temporarily sidelined the settler movement, its leaders remain determined, and only sustained pressure from the U.S. can prevent them from undermining the fragile peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet activist Cory Doctorow's term "enshittification" describes the predictable lifecycle of major online platforms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, where they gradually degrade their services to extract more value for themselves. He argues this process occurs in three stages: first, platforms are good to users to attract them; second, they pivot to being good to business customers to lock them in; and finally, they exploit both groups to maximize profits for shareholders. Doctorow attributes this decline to a lack of competition and regulation, allowing platforms to operate with high switching costs and minimal fear of losing their user base, ultimately turning once-useful services into a "pile of shit."</p>

          <p>Bernardo Bravo, the president of a lime growers association in the Mexican state of Michoacán, was found killed in his vehicle. His death comes after he had repeatedly and publicly denounced the extortion demands that organized crime groups impose on agricultural producers in the region. Bravo had stated in recent interviews that criminal demands had become unsustainable for growers, who were being forced to negotiate with cartels. This murder highlights the ongoing violence and control that cartels like Los Viagras exert over key agricultural industries in Mexico, including limes and avocados, despite federal efforts to protect producers.</p>

          <p>A group of former tenants of Equity Residential, one of the largest corporate landlords in the U.S., are organizing a "back rent debt strike" to demand the cancellation of tens of thousands of dollars in rental debt. Organized with the Debt Collective, the campaign uses a new online tool that helps tenants document landlord issues and generate formal dispute letters to challenge the debt. This tactic aims to make debt collection more costly for landlords and collectors while highlighting a growing crisis of rental debt that traps families in housing insecurity. The strike represents a new form of resistance as pandemic-era protections and rental assistance programs have expired, leaving many renters vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has increased for the fourth consecutive year, reaching an estimated 384 individuals. This slow but encouraging growth follows a significant decline in the previous decade, according to the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium. Scientists attribute the positive trend to conservation measures, particularly new protections in Canadian waters where the whales have been spending more time. While threats from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement persist, researchers are cautiously optimistic, also noting an increase in new mother whales and a higher birth rate, which are crucial for the species' long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece expresses skepticism about Instagram's latest teen safety feature, which automatically places users under 18 into a more restrictive "PG-13" content setting. The author argues that despite numerous promises, Meta has consistently failed to protect young users from harmful content, including material related to self-harm, eating disorders, and sexual harassment. Citing research showing previous safety tools were ineffective and internal documents revealing inaction on child grooming, the article suggests this new measure is more public relations than a genuine solution. The author concludes that without fundamental changes and stronger regulation, the responsibility for protecting children online will continue to fall on parents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's policy allowing ICE agents to enter homes without a judicial warrant is reckless and unconstitutional. The author contends that this tactic, based on an obscure 1798 law, bypasses 4th Amendment protections and creates a high-risk scenario for deadly shootouts. State "castle doctrine" laws, which permit residents to use lethal force against unlawful intruders, could legally protect a homeowner who fires on agents they perceive as armed home invaders. The author urges an immediate end to these warrantless raids to prevent a tragic and avoidable loss of life involving federal agents, residents, and bystanders.</p>

The show opens in a charged political climate, as the Trump administration is actively working to reinstall some of these same statues in public spaces.

Military experts have called the decision to fire live munitions over a major public highway highly unusual and a deviation from standard safety procedures.
