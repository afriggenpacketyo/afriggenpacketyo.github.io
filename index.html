          <p>Myanmar's rare-earths mining boom is causing environmental harm and funding conflict in Kachin State. Activists report that the in-situ leaching technique used to extract minerals poses significant risks to the environment and local villagers. Chinese imports of rare earth elements from Myanmar have skyrocketed, with these materials used in products by global companies. The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) now controls much of the mineral-rich region and is negotiating with Chinese producers on taxing rare earth extraction.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked global protests, the Trump administration is rolling back police reforms, and some say there has been no improvement in the US. Trump ordered the end of DEI programs in federal agencies. The US government has also announced it will dismiss several lawsuits against police departments in several US states and effectively put an end to investigations into police violence. While some positive changes have occurred, including the banning of knee-to-neck maneuvers, disappointment remains as many hoped-for reforms have not been realized.</p>
