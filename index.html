        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House's Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to draft layoff plans in anticipation of a potential government shutdown next week. This directive raises stakes as Congress faces a Tuesday deadline to pass a funding bill, with the memo suggesting layoffs could extend to programs not aligned with the President's priorities. While some essential services like Social Security and military operations would continue, the move has drawn criticism as an attempt at intimidation and an act of self-harm to the nation's talent. This comes amidst ongoing partisan disputes over funding and President Trump's cancellation of negotiations with Democratic leaders.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is projected to move northwestward over the coming days. The National Hurricane Center reports the storm is currently 505 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, and steady strengthening is anticipated due to favorable environmental conditions. While there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, forecasters are monitoring two systems in the western Atlantic, with potential downstream impacts for the Southeast U.S. coast. This marks the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Gabrielle.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated national security investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and medical devices. This action could lead to new tariffs, potentially increasing costs for consumers, hospitals, and manufacturers. The probes now include personal protective equipment, syringes, needles, prescription drugs, and medical equipment like pacemakers and hospital beds, reflecting concerns over reliance on foreign supply chains. The administration seeks to boost domestic production of these critical goods, building on previous tariffs on steel and aluminum and ongoing investigations into pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are close to deciding whether to seek an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a long-standing adversary of President Trump. The alleged charges remain unclear, but reports suggest investigations into whether Comey lied to Congress in 2020 regarding the FBI's 2016 Russia investigation, with the statute of limitations expiring soon. This development follows presidential pressure and the controversial resignation and replacement of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia with Trump's former personal lawyer. Legal experts express concern that political pressure could distort prosecutorial judgment in this high-profile case.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally mandate states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This decision is a legal setback for the administration's efforts to withhold funding from 'sanctuary' jurisdictions. The ruling, favoring 20 states, deemed the policy "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," citing potential irreparable harm to emergency preparedness and public safety. The Department of Homeland Security, however, maintains its commitment to restoring the rule of law and states that it will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has temporarily halted the planned culling of nearly 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms in British Columbia, following an avian flu outbreak. This decision allows the farm owners to appeal the cull order from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which cited risks of viral mutation and human health concerns. The case has garnered international attention, with figures like Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. Mehmet Oz offering support or re-homing options. The CFIA will maintain custody of the birds, providing care, while the legal battle continues.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's substantial investment in OpenAI, potentially reaching $100 billion, will largely be used by the AI startup to lease Nvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread its costs over the GPUs' useful life, mitigating financial risk for the non-investment-grade startup. While the investment aids in hiring and operations, the primary expenditure will be on compute capacity, crucial for developing large language models. This deal has raised concerns among some investors about the 'circular nature' of the AI industry's financing, with OpenAI aiming to generate revenue to cover these significant infrastructure costs.

This growth is predominantly led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, with several other countries quadrupling their imports. The trend is largely attributed to large-scale energy projects developed by Chinese firms, such as the 342MW De Aar Central Solar Power Plant in South Africa, showcasing China's dominance in global solar technology production.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel Live! saw a significant ratings surge upon the comedian's return to ABC, with his Tuesday episode drawing an audience four times larger than average. Despite being preempted by about a quarter of ABC affiliates, the show garnered 6.26 million broadcast viewers and its highest demographic rating since 2015. Kimmel's monologue, which addressed his recent suspension and President Trump's criticism, also amassed over 26 million views online. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk, leading to network and station owner actions, but his return demonstrated a strong public interest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has alleged "triple sabotage" at the United Nations, claiming a series of sinister events disrupted his address to the global body. Trump reported that an escalator stopped mid-ascent, his teleprompter went dark, and his wife couldn't hear his speech, dismissing the UN's explanation of an accidental trigger. He demanded an immediate investigation into what he termed "escalatorgate," suggesting a wider conspiracy. The incident, while trivial, was framed by Trump as an intentional plot to humiliate him, further fueling his narrative of being targeted.</p>

          <p>The U.S. tech sector and other industries are scrambling to adapt to a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program for skilled foreign workers, signed by President Trump. While the White House clarified the fee initially applies only to future applicants, it poses a crippling burden for startups and smaller firms, with some fearing it could lead to relocation or a "brain drain." Critics argue the policy is "anti-growth" and will prompt companies to offshore operations rather than hire U.S. workers. Supporters, however, contend major tech companies can absorb the cost, viewing it as a solution to program abuse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at a U.K. government lab have made a significant breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology by designing an exhaust system that dramatically reduces extreme heat inside fusion reactors. This innovation, published in Nature Energy, utilizes a "Super-X divertor" with extended plasma legs to create a neutral gas buffer, effectively cooling the plasma before it hits reactor walls. This development is crucial for making nuclear fusion a more practical and cheaper source of clean, nearly limitless energy, as it addresses a major challenge in safely handling intense plasma heat. The findings open new pathways for future fusion machine designs.</p>

          <p>A former Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, Oscar Rodriguez, has been sentenced to one year in prison for voluntary manslaughter in the on-duty killing of his girlfriend's former partner, Luis Morin. Initially deemed justified, a civil lawsuit revealed Rodriguez was romantically involved with Morin's ex and responded to her calls about Morin. The district attorney's office, which had recommended a 10-year sentence, objected to the court's decision, arguing it minimizes the gravity of Rodriguez's actions. The case highlights concerns about accountability within the sheriff's department and the impact on Morin's family, despite a $6.95 million civil settlement.</p>

He argued that California's regulatory framework fostered innovation like Tesla and continues to drive green technologies, contrasting it with federal rollbacks. Newsom also expressed deep concern about the future of democracy, fearing a potential lack of elections in 2028 if current trends continue, and rejected Vice President Vance's accusations of encouraging violence.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring financial support options for companies within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, following a cyber-attack that halted JLR car production. With factories suspended until next month, concerns are mounting that smaller suppliers, heavily reliant on JLR, could face bankruptcy. Proposed solutions include the government purchasing component parts to sustain businesses, or offering government-backed loans, though the latter is less popular. Industry experts emphasize the urgency of action to prevent widespread firm failures, as the cyber-attack is estimated to cost JLR at least £50 million weekly in lost production and impacts tens of thousands of workers.</p>

Foreign journalists have been largely barred from Gaza since Israel's 2023 offensive, with the IDF citing safety concerns and the Israeli High Court upholding restrictions.
