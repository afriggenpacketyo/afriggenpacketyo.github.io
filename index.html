          <p>President Trump, alongside Florida officials, toured a new temporary migrant detention center in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility is designed to house thousands of detainees in a remote, wildlife-filled area, which officials claim will deter escapes and encourage self-deportation. Critics, including environmental groups and protesters, have condemned the project as a "callous political stunt" and filed lawsuits to block its operation over environmental concerns. The administration suggests it could serve as a model for similar facilities in other states.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is formally shutting down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a move that a new study in The Lancet medical journal estimates could lead to 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. The research indicates that USAID programs have saved over 90 million lives in the past two decades by funding initiatives like HIV medication distribution and child nutrition. While the administration cites misspending, researchers argue the agency provides life-saving aid for just 18 cents per day from the average taxpayer.</p>

          <p>Parts of England are already in an official drought, and the risk is growing for other regions across the UK after the country experienced its sixth driest spring on record. Low rainfall has led to below-normal river flows and exceptionally low reservoir levels, particularly in northern England. The dry conditions are already impacting farmers and wildlife, and long-term forecasts suggest the pattern may continue through the summer.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has strongly condemned the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement actions, labeling them an "all-out assault on Los Angeles." Her comments came in response to a Department of Justice lawsuit challenging the city's sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. Bass criticized the raids for indiscriminately targeting residents and vowed not to be intimidated. The conflict highlights the escalating tensions between the federal government and cities over immigration policy, with the White House defending the actions as necessary for removing criminals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law a major reform of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), aimed at accelerating housing construction. The changes largely waive CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas, removing a tool often used by opponents to delay or block development. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, this reform marks a significant political shift away from using the 55-year-old law to stifle housing. The immediate effect may be more of a revolution in the development process than a sudden construction boom.</p>
