          <p>Despite rumors of potential trades, Atlanta Falcons General Manager Terry Fontenot expressed no surprise at Kirk Cousins' participation in the team's voluntary offseason program. Fontenot emphasized that Cousins' presence is voluntary and acknowledged the quarterback's professionalism. Coach Raheem Morris also stated the team would not hinder Cousins if an opportunity to start elsewhere arises, though the team values him as a backup. Amid interest from other NFL teams, a trade for Cousins could potentially occur during the draft, but the Falcons prioritize improving their roster overall. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics fear this change would contradict the company's mission and founding principles, potentially leading to the development of dangerous AI technology without sufficient oversight.

Abrego Garcia, who has no criminal record, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are advocating for fines up to £1,000 for individuals who play music and videos loudly on public transport, referred to as "headphone dodgers." The proposal aims to address anti-social behavior on trains and buses in England, as existing railway byelaws already prohibit such actions. A survey revealed that many people feel uncomfortable asking others to turn down their music. While the idea has cross-party support, it is unlikely to become law without government backing.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent Southeast Asian tour has highlighted Beijing's approach to the South China Sea disputes: manage tensions rather than escalate them, while emphasizing cooperation and regional stability. Joint statements with Hanoi and Kuala Lumpur stress peaceful dispute resolution and adherence to international law. China aims to keep the disputes as a part of ties with neighbors but not the defining factor. This strategy seeks to reassure Southeast Asian nations amid ongoing tensions.</p>
