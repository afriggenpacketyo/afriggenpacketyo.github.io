          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, urging the return of hostages. Simultaneously, he criticized the ongoing corruption trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, labeling it a "political witch hunt" that he claims interferes with negotiations. The article also notes that the Israeli military has ordered new evacuations in northern Gaza as it expands its operations, adding to the humanitarian crisis in the region. This comes as ceasefire talks have repeatedly stalled over disagreements on how to permanently end the war, a key point of contention between the involved parties.</p>

Tuipulotu also praised the influence of fly-half Finn Russell, noting that the team's blend of structured play and individual instinct makes them difficult to defend against.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have discovered that a modified compound from the fungus *Aspergillus flavus* shows promise in fighting cancer cells. This fungus was historically rumored to be the cause of the "pharaoh's curse" after several archaeologists died following the opening of ancient tombs. Scientists created a new compound that effectively blocks the division of leukemia cells, with one variant performing as well as two FDA-approved drugs. While the study is in its early stages and has so far only been tested on cell cultures, it represents a potential new avenue for cancer therapy derived from natural sources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods are significantly impacting the bridal industry, as approximately 90% of wedding dresses sold in the U.S. are manufactured in China. Brides and boutique owners are facing price increases of 10% to 30%, creating financial strain and uncertainty in an industry reliant on long-term special orders. The tariffs have made it difficult for store owners to budget and have led to some couples delaying their purchases. Despite the aim of boosting American manufacturing, industry experts state that the U.S. currently lacks the skilled labor to produce these gowns domestically at a comparable price point.

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a searchable national citizenship data system, integrating Social Security and immigration databases to allow election officials to verify voter eligibility. This new tool, an expansion of the existing SAVE system, was created without a public process, raising significant concerns among privacy advocates and legal experts about data security and potential misuse. While proponents argue it could streamline voter verification and reduce the burden on voters, critics worry about the accuracy of the data and the potential for disenfranchising eligible citizens. The move is seen as a major step towards a centralized national database, a historically controversial concept in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Markus SÃ¶der, the state premier of Bavaria and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), has advocated for Germany to establish a comprehensive missile defense shield similar to Israel's "Iron Dome." He called for the acquisition of thousands of drones, new missile systems, and approximately 2,000 Patriot systems to protect the country from potential attacks. The call for enhanced defense capabilities comes as German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, during a visit to Israel, expressed strong support for Israel's actions against Iran's nuclear program, framing it as a threat to both Israel and Europe. SÃ¶der suggested Germany should cooperate with Ukraine and Israel to leverage their defense experience.</p>

He guided the damaged plane away from residential areas but was unable to eject in time. The large-scale attack prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its own aircraft as a precaution.

The article suggests that Europe's inability to align on key issues, such as defense spending, undermines its efforts to be a significant geopolitical player.

          <p>Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels within a matter of months.

Grossi clarified that while the damage was severe, it was not total, and Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program. The statement comes as tensions between Iran and the IAEA escalate, with Iran's parliament voting to suspend cooperation with the watchdog.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf in Pakistan has highlighted the severe dangers women face when they have a public online presence in the country. Many female influencers and content creators report experiencing online stalking, harassment, and death threats, which can escalate into real-world violence. The article explores how patriarchal norms often frame women's public self-expression as a threat to cultural and religious values, leading to social backlash and privacy violations. Despite the risks, many Pakistani women continue to use social media to build careers, raise awareness on social issues, and create communities, navigating a challenging digital landscape.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, at least 81 Palestinians were killed and over 400 were injured in Israeli strikes over a 24-hour period. One specific incident involved a strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was being used as a shelter for displaced people, killing at least 11 individuals, including children. The article notes the difficulty for emergency services to reach victims due to the destruction. Meanwhile, mediators are reportedly intensifying efforts for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, though previous agreements have collapsed amid ongoing hostilities.</p>

          <p>Samuel Woodward, a former high school classmate of Blaze Bernstein, has been found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 stabbing death of the 19-year-old college student. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, who had ties to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, killed Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The trial, delayed for six years, detailed how Woodward stabbed Bernstein 28 times and buried his body in a park. Bernstein's parents, Jeanne Pepper and Gideon Bernstein, have since founded "BlazeItForward," a movement to promote kindness and tolerance in response to the hate that motivated their son's murder.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move is part of the EU's broader push for technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, industry experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, pointing to the massive disparity in scale; Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has 650 satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. While the investment positions Eutelsat as a strategic asset for sovereign and enterprise applications, analysts believe it is unlikely to achieve parity in the mass-market broadband segment in the near future.</p>

          <p>The first six months of the year have been marked by significant market volatility, driven by geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and political uncertainty, leading to a challenging outlook for the second half.

The article highlights the resilience of some stock markets, like Germany's Dax, but warns that elevated policy uncertainty and a worsening macroeconomic backdrop are likely to fuel further instability.

          <p>Quemoy, also known as Kinmen, is a Taipei-administered island located just a few kilometers off the coast of mainland China, embodying the complex relationship between the two sides. Once a heavily militarized front line, it has since transformed into a quiet community caught between competing political systems. The island's unique position reveals the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. While Taipei once promoted Quemoy as a model of its governance, and still views it as a strategic deterrent, its geographical and cultural proximity to the mainland creates a distinct local identity that navigates the tense political divide.</p>

          <p>Five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel land mines. This move reflects growing security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is part of a broader strategy to create a deterrent "Iron Curtain" along NATO's eastern flank. The plan involves producing and storing mines for rapid deployment in an emergency, aiming to inflict heavy losses on any potential aggressor. The decision is controversial, as critics warn that land mines are indiscriminate weapons that pose a long-term danger to civilians long after conflicts end.</p>

A small but growing number of foreign tourists are venturing into the country, drawn by its landscapes and history, now that the decades-long war has ended and general violence has decreased. While Western governments still advise against travel, the Taliban are issuing visas and have even established a hospitality training institute. The trend raises ethical questions, particularly regarding the government's severe restrictions on women, but some visitors feel their travel supports local people directly rather than the regime.</p>

The rules, which went into effect on Sunday, are part of a national plan to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and protect non-smokers, particularly children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Violators could face fines up to â‚¬700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not apply to the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants. Health officials note that while smoking rates are declining, tobacco-related illnesses still cause around 75,000 deaths annually in France.</p>
