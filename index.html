          <p>The UK anxiously awaits President Trump's tariff announcement, hoping for a negotiated outcome.  Ongoing talks between London and Washington aim to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs and improve trade relations in specific sectors.  However, the government faces a political challenge in balancing its public civility with the need to address any imposed tariffs. The unpredictability of Trump's actions adds to the uncertainty.</p>
