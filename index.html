          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 13:11:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Independent rural hospitals across the United States are forming clinically integrated networks to pool resources and negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units. This collaborative model allows smaller hospitals to remain autonomous while gaining the collective bargaining power of larger systems. These networks, such as the Rough Rider Network in North Dakota, focus on sharing specialists, investing in community health projects, and securing value-based care contracts. By combining their patient numbers, these hospitals can save money on essential services and improve health outcomes, offering a viable alternative to closing down or being acquired by major health corporations.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been released from the hospital and is reportedly recovering well after a car crash in New Hampshire. The incident occurred when the vehicle he was a passenger in was struck from behind on Interstate 93. Prior to the crash, Giuliani and his associate had stopped to assist a woman who reported being a victim of domestic violence. New Hampshire State Police are investigating the collision, noting that the other driver was not connected to the domestic violence incident and that distraction may have been a factor. Giuliani was treated for a fractured thoracic vertebrae and other injuries.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, co-creator of the comedy series "Father Ted," was arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence through posts made on the social media platform X. The arrest, which involved five officers, was reportedly related to three posts from April concerning his views on transgender individuals in female-only spaces. After his arrest, Linehan was taken to a hospital due to health concerns and later released on bail with the condition that he not use X. The incident has drawn criticism from figures like author JK Rowling and various politicians, sparking a debate on free speech and the allocation of police resources.</p>

          <p>An advice column in The Atlantic responds to a 79-year-old woman who feels trapped caring for her 88-year-old husband with dementia, for whom she has not felt love for decades. The woman describes a marriage that quickly became emotionally distant and her current struggle with the demands of being his sole caretaker without financial resources for help. The columnist, James Parker, validates her feelings of resentment and advises her to release any guilt, suggesting she find small, personal ways to care for her own well-being. He reframes her role not as a "loved one's" caretaker but as someone performing a difficult, admirable, and necessary duty.</p>

          <p>Elias Morgan has been sentenced to a minimum of 45 years in prison for the murder of prison officer Lenny Scott, who was shot six times outside a gym in Skelmersdale, Lancashire. The court determined the killing was a meticulously planned act of revenge, stemming from a 2020 incident where Scott confiscated a phone from Morgan's cell, exposing Morgan's illicit relationship with a female officer. During sentencing, the judge described the murder as a "cold-blooded execution" of a man performing his lawful duty. The victim's family delivered powerful statements in court, describing Scott as a man of integrity and condemning his killer's cowardice.</p>

Lenders also conduct a financial assessment to ensure the borrower can afford ongoing costs like property taxes and insurance, and mandatory counseling is required to ensure comprehension of the loan's terms.

          <p>San Diego Padres relief pitcher Jason Adam will be out for the remainder of the season after rupturing a quad tendon while fielding a ball. Adam has been a formidable opponent for the Los Angeles Dodgers, having never allowed a run against them in 15 career appearances. His injury represents a significant loss for the Padres' bullpen as they compete with the Dodgers in a tight pennant race. Since joining the Padres, Adam has maintained an impressive 1.37 ERA, making his absence a major blow to the team's pitching depth during a critical part of the season.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has stated he is disappointed with the recently announced plan to split Kraft Heinz back into two separate companies, a move that reverses the major 2015 merger he helped orchestrate. Berkshire Hathaway is the food conglomerate's largest shareholder with a 27.5% stake, which it has held since the merger. Following Buffett's comments, shares of Kraft Heinz fell by more than 5%. Buffett conveyed that while the original merger did not yield the expected results, he does not believe that deconstructing the company is the solution to its ongoing struggles with performance and brand investment.

Helicopters are being used to search for survivors and airlift them from the devastated areas.

The lawsuit, filed in the High Court, alleges that they have not received their fair share of income from iconic songs like "Roxanne" and "Every Breath You Take." Although Sting was the primary songwriter, Summers and Copeland argue that an oral agreement from 1977, later formalized in contracts, entitled them to a percentage of all publishing income. Sting's legal team denies the claims, asserting that the agreement only covered specific types of royalties and that a 2016 agreement prevents further disputes.</p>
