          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has resulted in one death and four injuries, prompting the FBI to declare it an "intentional act of terrorism." The blast, which occurred at North Indian Canyon Drive near East Tachevah Drive, severely damaged nearby buildings and spread debris over a wide area. Authorities have identified a person-of-interest but believe there is no ongoing threat to the public, and the motive remains unknown. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, is expected to reopen on Monday after confirming that staff were unharmed and embryos in storage were safe. The FBI and ATF are assisting with the investigation, and evacuations were carried out in the nearby Twentynine Palms neighborhood. </p>

The author shares her own family's experience, as her parents gained custody of her sister's four children after her sister struggled with addiction and instability. The article highlights the emotional and financial challenges faced by these grandparents, who often sacrifice their own dreams and well-being to provide a stable home for the children, and notes that this situation is becoming increasingly common due to the opioid epidemic. The article also discusses the impact on the other siblings, who may receive less attention as a result. </p>

          <p>Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have reportedly killed over 100 people overnight, leading to the closure of the main hospital in northern Gaza. The article cites local health officials who state that dozens were killed in Khan Younis, and a strike on a home in Jabaliya refugee camp resulted in nine deaths from a single family. The Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza was forced to shut down due to nearby fighting and an Israeli military "siege." The Israeli military stated that troops were operating against terror infrastructure sites in northern Gaza. Negotiating teams are working to realize a deal that would bring an end to the fighting in exchange for the release of all the remaining hostages, Hamas' exile from Gaza and the disarmament of the Palestinian territory. </p>

While the Magna Carta may not be a financial windfall, it serves as a powerful symbol of the importance of checks and balances and the limitations of power, values that are currently being challenged.
