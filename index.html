          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have introduced a series of measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amidst ongoing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China aims to boost liquidity and support key sectors such as technology and real estate, alongside initiatives for consumption and elderly care. However, some economists believe that borrowing may not be significantly impacted by these rate adjustments. The Chinese government is also planning further support for small and medium enterprises and the private sector to mitigate the effects of tariffs and promote employment. (not investment advice)</p>

This agreement signifies a notable shift for the Japanese auto industry, which has traditionally been hesitant to outsource manufacturing outside the automotive sector.

Trump, who has campaigned on ending the war, suggests that allowing Russia to play in the World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, could motivate a resolution.</p>
