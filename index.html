        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, is now explicitly addressing "disorderly low-price competition" across various industries, a more direct term than previously used vague descriptions. This new focus aims to regulate market behavior where companies aggressively suppress prices to capture market share, which Beijing identifies as detrimental to innovation, efficiency, and product quality. The government views tackling this phenomenon as crucial for the health of the world's second-largest economy, seeking to guide enterprises towards improving product quality and facilitating the orderly exit of outdated production capacity. This directive underscores a concerted effort to foster a more stable and high-quality economic development model within the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement with former President Trump's foundation, resolving a lawsuit he filed over the editing of a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. The agreement includes Paramount covering Trump's legal fees and a commitment from "60 Minutes" to release future presidential candidate interview transcripts, though no apology was issued. Legal experts across the ideological spectrum have criticized Trump's lawsuit as frivolous and an attempt to intimidate the press, suggesting the settlement represents a bitter blow to journalistic independence. Corporate executives, including Paramount's controlling owner Shari Redstone, likely pursued the deal due to significant business interests, such as the company's ongoing sale review by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>

          <p>Europe is enduring an intensifying early summer heatwave, with red alerts issued for parts of Germany and France, and record temperatures reported across Spain and Portugal. The extreme conditions have led to widespread disruptions, including school closures, reduced operating hours for tourist attractions like Brussels' Atomium, and power outages in Italian cities due to overloaded grids. German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider highlighted the heatwave as exposing social inequality and called climate change the biggest social issue of the 21st century. The UN climate agency warned that such heatwaves will become more frequent and intense due to human-induced climate change, emphasizing the critical need for early warnings and action plans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent fire at an electrical substation that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport, causing thousands of flight cancellations and stranding passengers, has been traced back to an electrical issue first identified seven years ago but never rectified. The National Energy System Operator (NESO) determined that moisture entering electrical components caused a short circuit, which then ignited oil. Heathrow Airport responded by attributing the "catastrophic power outage" to a combination of outdated regulation, inadequate safety mechanisms, and the National Grid's failure to maintain its essential infrastructure. This incident underscores critical deficiencies in long-term maintenance and regulatory oversight that led to significant public inconvenience and economic impact.</p>

          <p>A fireworks facility in Yolo County, California, experienced a series of massive explosions and a significant fire, prompting immediate evacuations within a one-mile radius. The blaze quickly spread, burning over 70 acres and destroying an outbuilding, with large plumes of black smoke and continuous fireworks igniting within the inferno. Fire crews battled the active blaze late into the night, maintaining a safe perimeter while putting out spot fires in the surrounding area. Authorities have reported no injuries, and the State Fire Marshal's arson and bomb investigation team has been deployed to determine the cause of the destructive incident.</p>

          <p>In a surprising NBA free agency development, Myles Turner is set to join the Milwaukee Bucks on a four-year, $107 million contract, while the Bucks have waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard. This move allows the Bucks to acquire Turner, a longtime Indiana Pacers stalwart, by stretching Lillard's remaining $112.6 million contract over five seasons. Both players' recent Achilles tendon injuries played a role, with Lillard likely missing most of the coming season, giving him time to recover and choose his next team. The first full day of free agency also saw other significant agreements, including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's record-setting extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder and various other player movements across the league.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill," recently passed by the Senate, proposes a significant increase in tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S., raising them from 25% to 35%. This provision aims to further incentivize domestic chip production for major companies like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Micron Technology, building upon the existing CHIPS and Science Act. The legislation still requires passage in the House before a July 4 deadline. Experts suggest that the threat of Trump's tariffs has already created urgency for onshoring efforts, and these expanded investment tax credits are expected to accelerate the expansion of U.S. chip manufacturing capacity.

          <p>Russia has significantly ramped up military offensives on two fronts in Ukraine, steadily gaining ground in the strategic eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk and threatening to expand fighting into the Dnipropetrovsk region.

Both sides are intensely seeking an advantage before the fighting season wanes in the autumn.

          <p>At least 180 current and former military aircrew are pursuing the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for compensation, claiming their cancer diagnoses were caused by prolonged exposure to toxic fumes in helicopters. While the MoD has not admitted liability, six individuals have already received out-of-court settlements. The affected aircraft include the Sea King, Westland Wessex, Puma, and CH-47 Chinook, with personnel developing various cancers, including rare forms of blood cancer. Advocacy groups and the widow of one deceased airman are urgently calling for the MoD to implement comprehensive cancer screening programs and provide additional protective equipment for both serving and former personnel.</p>

          <p>The G7 countries are facing strong criticism for a recent deal with the US Treasury that effectively exempts American companies from previously agreed global minimum tax rules, significantly undermining Pillar Two of the OECD/G20 framework. Critics argue this decision, influenced by President Trump and intense corporate lobbying, allows some US multinationals to continue benefiting from near-zero taxes in tax havens, creating an unfair competitive advantage. This move is viewed as fiscally irresponsible and morally indefensible, jeopardizing global tax justice and potentially eroding the integrity of international tax cooperation. The article suggests this action sets a dangerous precedent, weakening efforts to ensure corporations pay their fair share worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

Beyond health, the relentless heat disrupts societal functions, impacts critical infrastructure like roads and railways, and exacerbates other disasters such as droughts and wildfires.
