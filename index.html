            <p>Following an attack by Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi on prison guards, the entire terrorism prison unit at HMP Frankland has been emptied, and an investigation has been launched. Abedi, already serving a life sentence for murdering 22 people, attacked officers with hot oil and improvised weapons, resulting in serious injuries to two guards. Martin Hibbert, a survivor of the 2017 bombing, criticized the "comfort and privilege" afforded to Abedi and expressed outrage at the disrespect shown to victims. The Ministry of Justice has suspended kitchen access in separation centers and will conduct a full independent review of the incident.</p>

            <p>Actor Patrick Warburton, known for his roles in "Seinfeld" and "Family Guy," revealed that his devoutly Catholic parents were not fans of his work, viewing it as blasphemous. They particularly disliked "Family Guy" and even attempted to have it taken off the air, despite Warburton's financial support from the show. His parents also disapproved of his role in "Seinfeld" due to their religious beliefs, which led to a six-page letter from his father expressing disappointment. Warburton humorously recounted his mother's attempts to convert Jerry Seinfeld to Catholicism.</p>

            <p>Families are claiming that civil rights investigations in schools have been stalled due to federal budget cuts within the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). This has resulted in a significant loss of staff and the closure of regional offices, leading to delays in addressing discrimination complaints, particularly those related to disability. Parents express frustration over the lack of progress in their cases, highlighting the importance of OCR in addressing systemic discrimination and ensuring equal educational opportunities for children with disabilities. The Trump administration defends the changes, arguing that the Justice Department could handle civil rights investigations more effectively.</p>

A woman's struggle to help her mother, who has schizoaffective disorder and is homeless, illustrates the difficulties in accessing long-term mental health services. While Montana is investing $300 million to improve its behavioral health system, advocates emphasize the need for increased spending on housing and community support to break the cycle of crisis. The article underscores the importance of balancing short-term crisis services with long-term solutions for individuals with severe mental illness.</p>

            <p>An international team of scientists has mapped the multi-generational migration route of painted lady butterflies, spanning thousands of miles across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The project, called the Worldwide Painted Lady Migration Project, has identified ten generations of butterflies involved in the annual cycle, following seasonal rains and blooming flowers. Photographer Lucas Foglia documented the journey, capturing the butterflies' adaptability to climate change and their interactions with human migration patterns. The butterflies' ability to cross borders contrasts with the challenges faced by human migrants seeking refuge.</p>

            <p>The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, held annually in Indio, California, has become a global phenomenon known for its diverse lineup, celebrity attendees, and commercial opportunities. However, the festival's location is not in the city of Coachella itself, but rather in the broader Coachella Valley, a region with a rich history in agriculture and entertainment. The valley's origins trace back to the railroad system and a typo, and it has since become synonymous with wealth and celebrity while also being home to a large population of farmworkers. The festival has significantly boosted the local economy, but it also highlights the vast disparities in wealth within the region.</p>

Authorities believe the kidnapping was financially motivated, as kidnappings for ransom have increased in South Africa in recent years.

            <p>Josh Sullivan, an American pastor kidnapped during a church service in South Africa, was rescued following a "high-intensity shoot-out" with police that left three people dead. The pastor was found unharmed in Gqeberha, where he was abducted, after a ransom demand prompted intervention by South Africa's elite police unit. Sullivan had been in South Africa since 2018 to establish a church for Xhosa-speaking people. The police stated that the kidnappers were suspected of having been familiar with the family's movements.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government, under President Trump, is transferring control of a federal land strip along the U.S.-Mexico border to the Department of Defense, allowing the Army to control the area as a base. This move could enable troops to detain individuals, including migrants, entering the area without authorization. This action is seen as an attempt to circumvent federal law prohibiting the use of U.S. troops for law enforcement on American soil. The military's role will be to secure the land, potentially arresting unauthorized individuals, who would then be handed over to civilian law enforcement agencies.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off amidst market turmoil caused by President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs, leading to a spike in yields. China, as America's second-largest foreign creditor, is suspected of weaponizing its Treasury holdings by selling U.S. debt and converting the proceeds into Euros or German bunds. Japan's life insurers are also being scrutinized for potentially selling long-dated Treasurys to purchase European fixed income. The sell-off could also be attributed to a combination of European and Japanese pension accounts rebalancing their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Harvard University is resisting President Donald Trump's demands, even after the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funds. President Alan Garber stated that the government should not dictate what private universities can teach. The move follows Harvard's refusal to agree to a list of demands related to governance, hiring, and teaching practices. The government's actions are linked to concerns about antisemitism on campuses and the government's review of universities. Former President Barack Obama praised Harvard's stance, calling Trump's move "unlawful and ham-handed."</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's threatened and implemented tariffs have plunged the U.S. into global trade wars, creating uncertainty for businesses and economies worldwide. Throughout his first term, Trump initiated a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on most of its products, with Beijing retaliating with its own tariffs. He also used tariffs as leverage to renegotiate the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. The timeline outlines the sequence of events, including tariff implementations, retaliatory measures, and suspensions, affecting trade relations with various countries.</p>

            <p>A study suggests that the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes (vapes) is falling in the UK ahead of a ban on their sale. The percentage of young adults using disposable vapes has decreased significantly, but researchers believe users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes rather than quitting altogether. The government's ban aims to stop littering and protect children from harm. The study warns that the ban may have a limited impact on overall vaping rates, as vaping in general has stalled after years of growth.</p>
