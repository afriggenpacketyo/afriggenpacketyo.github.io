New Delhi has indicated it will not be rushed by deadlines, prioritizing its national interests while expressing confidence that a favorable deal can eventually be reached.</p>

          <p>Ford has increased its forecast for the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, now expecting a $2 billion hit for the year, which is significantly higher than previous estimates. The costs are attributed to sustained duties on imported steel and aluminum, as well as on goods from Mexico and Canada, where the company has major manufacturing facilities.

While Seoul secured a favorable tariff rate for its key automotive sector, it successfully resisted U.S. pressure to further open its sensitive agricultural markets, marking a key victory for its negotiators.

          <p>Following the tsunami generated by a major earthquake off Russia, this article explains the science of how these powerful waves are created and how people can respond to them safely. A tsunami typically requires a strong underwater earthquake with vertical motion, creating waves that travel at high speeds in the deep ocean before slowing and growing in height near the shore. Experts stress the critical importance of heeding official warnings and moving to higher ground immediately.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has observed and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The team discovered vast fields of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats fueled by chemical seeps from the ocean floor. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments and suggests these unique ecosystems may be more widespread on the planet than previously thought.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complex and often contradictory scientific debate surrounding the effects of screen time on child development. While popular opinion and some researchers suggest significant negative impacts on mental health and sleep, other academics argue that much of the scientific evidence is flawed and inconclusive. They point out that research often relies on self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use, suggesting that other factors like loneliness may be more influential.</p>

French ministers condemned the "brutal" use of force and a Spanish minister's since-deleted post calling the teens "Israeli brats." The airline claims the group was disruptive, but other passenger accounts differ, leading to allegations of antisemitism and a formal expression of concern from France's foreign minister.</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans are moving forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts five years ahead of the typical schedule, a move reportedly initiated at the request of former President Trump. The proposed map could significantly increase the GOP's majority in the state's U.S. House delegation. This has prompted threats of retaliatory gerrymandering from Democrats in states like California and Illinois, raising the prospect of a partisan race to the bottom that could further erode democratic norms.</p>
