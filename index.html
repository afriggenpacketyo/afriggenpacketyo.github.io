          <p>Airstrikes on a migrant detention center in Houthi-controlled Yemen resulted in the deaths of at least 68 people, according to Houthi-run media. The strikes, attributed to the US military, also injured 47 individuals and caused widespread destruction to the facility in Saada province. The US Central Command had earlier reported hitting over 800 targets as part of an intensified air campaign against the Houthis, claiming to have killed hundreds of fighters and leaders. The Houthis have reported civilian casualties from these strikes as well, raising concerns about the impact of the conflict on non-combatants.</p>

          <p>Canadians cast their votes in a snap federal election marked by debates over tariffs imposed by the US and discussions of potentially joining the US as the 51st state. Preliminary results are expected late Monday or early Tuesday, with close attention paid to key regions like Ontario and Quebec. The election outcome will determine whether the Liberals, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, or the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, will form the next government, and whether it will be a majority or minority government.

          <p>The Jacksonville Jaguars made a splash in the 2025 NFL Draft by trading up to select Travis Hunter, a rare two-way player, signaling a bold shift in team philosophy. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Falcons' draft strategy, particularly their trade for pass-rusher James Pearce Jr., has drawn criticism for being an overpay. The draft also saw Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel's prospects complicated by the Browns' selection of Shedeur Sanders, creating a potential media circus. The Chicago Bears, on the other hand, are seen as winners for providing Caleb Williams with new offensive weapons and improved protection.</p>

          <p>Marriage registrations in China continue to fall, prompting local governments to offer financial incentives to encourage young couples to wed. The first quarter of 2025 saw a decrease of 8% in marriage registrations compared to the previous year, coupled with a rise in divorce registrations. This trend, combined with low birth rates and a shrinking population, poses challenges for the Chinese economy. To address this, China has streamlined marriage registration rules, but demographers believe more comprehensive measures are needed to reverse the decline.</p>

          <p>Increased infrastructure spending in Germany will provide a boost to Europe's economic growth, but the positive impact will be overshadowed by the negative effects of U.S. tariffs, according to the IMF. The IMF has downgraded its growth outlook for the euro area due to President Trump's tariff policies. While Germany's infrastructure spending bill will offer some offset, the overall impact of tariffs will continue to weigh on the region's economic prospects.</p>

          <p>A Syrian man is on trial in France, accused of war crimes committed during the Syrian civil war. Majdi Nema, also known as Islam Allouch, a former spokesperson for Jaysh al-Islam, faces charges of complicity in war crimes and participating in a group formed to prepare war crimes. The trial is the first to examine atrocities allegedly committed by JAI during the Syrian conflict. The case is possible because the accused was considered to have had a strong enough connection to France, because he was living there at the time of his arrest.</p>

Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen, and historical records to understand the impact of the Han dynasty's riverine warfare on the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples revealed a decline in swamp cypress pollen around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Nanyue's capital, Panyu, which was set ablaze.</p>

The impact is primarily symbolic, causing inconvenience rather than major disruption for Indian airlines. The closure may make it harder for Indian carriers to compete with other airlines.</p>
