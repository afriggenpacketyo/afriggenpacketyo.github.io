          <p>The White House has announced an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, raising the total rate to 50% due to the country's continued purchase of Russian oil. The executive order frames India's actions as fueling Russia's war effort in Ukraine, making this one of the highest levies imposed on a U.S. trading partner. This move follows President Trump's recent threats to penalize nations that buy Russian energy and military equipment, escalating trade tensions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has characterized multibillion-dollar investment pledges from trade partners like Japan and the European Union as "gifts" or a "signing bonus," a view not shared by the other nations.

          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, leveraging home equity is a key financial strategy, with options including selling the home or obtaining a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to access their equity as cash without a monthly payment, helping cover living expenses, but it reduces the inheritance for heirs and has associated fees. Selling the home can provide a large lump sum but involves transaction costs and the challenges of a new housing market. Experts suggest the best choice depends on individual goals, such as the desire to stay in the home versus relocating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Nigerian Villagers Strike Peace Deals with Bandit Groups Amid Government's Failure to Provide Security</h2>

          <p>In northern Nigeria, communities are increasingly negotiating peace deals directly with violent bandit groups due to the state's inability to protect them. Villagers in states like Sokoto and Zamfara have suffered from abductions, killings, and the disruption of their farming livelihoods. These agreements often involve paying protection fees to the gangs, a move analysts describe as a "rational survival calculus" but also a sign of failing governance. While some residents support the deals as the only way to end the bloodshed, others find it unacceptable to make peace with their attackers.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Iran and Pakistan have agreed to enhance bilateral relations, aiming to increase trade to $10 billion and bolster security cooperation. The partnership focuses on addressing militant activity along their shared 900-kilometer border, a region troubled by separatist insurgencies. Despite occasional tensions and cross-border strikes, the two nations maintain a strategic alliance. Analysts note Iran is pursuing this "security diplomacy" at a time of heightened regional tension, viewing Pakistan as an unlikely platform for hostile actions against it.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new season of "MasterChef" that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following an investigation into misconduct allegations. While the BBC decided to broadcast the series for the sake of the contestants, the episodes appear to be edited to minimize the hosts' usual jokes and banter. The decision has faced backlash from some of the women who came forward with complaints and has been met with mixed reviews, with critics noting the show feels different and has a "bitter aftertaste."</p>

          <p>Iran is grappling with an extreme heatwave and drought, forcing the government to close public offices in 16 provinces to conserve power. The capital, Tehran, is experiencing its lowest rainfall in 60 years, leading to depleted reservoirs and reduced water pressure for its 9 million residents. Experts, who have warned for decades about the consequences of resource mismanagement and uncontrolled urban growth, say that 80% of the country's reservoirs are nearly empty. The crisis highlights the severe environmental and infrastructure challenges facing the nation.</p>
