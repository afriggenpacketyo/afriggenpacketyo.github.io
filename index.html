        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, the world's fourth-largest, has ceased using Western industrial chips in its operations. This decision stems from increasing concerns over vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, a risk highlighted by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus. The move is part of China's broader effort to enhance national security and reduce reliance on foreign technology in critical infrastructure. This strategic shift underscores growing geopolitical tensions in the tech sector.</p>

          <p>The family of David Barnes, an American held in Russia on charges stemming from alleged crimes in the U.S. that American prosecutors found unsubstantiated, hopes for his release via a prisoner exchange. As President Trump prepares to meet with Russian President Putin in Alaska, Barnes' family and supporters, including Senator John Cornyn, are urging the administration to prioritize his case. Barnes has been detained since January 2022, serving a 21.5-year sentence in Moscow, unlike other Americans transferred to penal colonies. His family believes he is wrongfully detained and seeks high-level intervention.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon in Hong Kong, is undergoing trial for alleged collusion with foreign forces under Beijing's national security law. Detained since December 2020, Lai faces a potential life sentence, with critics arguing his case weaponizes the legal system to suppress political opposition. His son and international figures, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have called for his release, citing his age and health. Lai, a self-described "rebel" who founded influential pro-democracy publications, remains a symbol of defiance against Beijing's tightening control over Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Montanez Merriweather, a suspect in a widely publicized downtown Cincinnati beating that injured six people, has been indicted on a new federal gun charge for illegally possessing a 9mm pistol as a convicted felon. Merriweather, 34, is already in state custody facing multiple charges, including felonious assault and aggravated rioting, related to the July 26 incident. The brutal attack left one Ohio mother with brain trauma, and if convicted on the gun charge, Merriweather faces up to 15 years in prison. U.S. Attorney Dominick S.

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has dismissed South Korea's efforts to revive dialogue, reiterating Pyongyang's disinterest in negotiations with Seoul and Washington. She denied claims that North Korea removed loudspeakers from the border, asserting that planned joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea demonstrate their hostility. Kim Yo Jong also ruled out conveying messages to the U.S. via Russian President Putin, emphasizing that North Korea's stance against improving relations with the South will be constitutionally fixed. The two Koreas technically remain at war, with an armistice in place since 1953.</p>

          <p>Eighty years later, the Japanese city of Kumagaya bears the scars of the last U.S. firebombing of World War II, which occurred less than 12 hours before Japan's surrender. On August 14-15, 1945, nearly 90 B-29 bombers dropped napalm, killing at least 260 people and destroying almost 75% of the city. Survivors recount the horror, with one recalling being born amidst the flames. The attack, part of General Curtis LeMay's controversial strategy, has raised questions about war crimes, though survivors express no animosity towards the U.S., attributing the tragedy to the momentum of war.</p>

          <p>UK cities are increasingly vulnerable to "firewaves," a new phenomenon where multiple urban wildfires are triggered by prolonged hot, dry weather, according to Imperial College London scientists. Recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this risk, as climate change creates conditions conducive to rapid fire spread in urban green spaces. Researchers suggest a "firewave" can occur after ten consecutive days of very dry weather, overwhelming emergency services. The London Fire Brigade is adopting proactive measures, including drones and off-road vehicles, but experts advocate for the Met Office to adopt the "firewave" term to better inform public safety strategies.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and NATO leaders held virtual meetings to discuss the Ukraine war ahead of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy emphasized that "everything regarding Ukraine needs to be discussed with Ukraine" and warned that "Putin is bluffing," urging continued sanctions on Moscow. Trump expressed optimism for a "constructive" meeting and hinted at "very severe consequences" for Putin if no ceasefire is reached, also suggesting a potential follow-up meeting involving himself, Putin, and Zelenskyy. European allies stress the need for Ukraine's sovereignty and robust security guarantees.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, experienced record floodwaters from a Mendenhall Glacier "outburst flood," with the Mendenhall River peaking at an unprecedented 16.65 feet. While threatening parts of the city, temporary Hesco barriers largely protected hundreds of homes, preventing a catastrophic event. This annual glacial flooding, caused by water accumulating in Suicide Basin, has intensified in recent years due to climate change, leading to successive record crests and past property damage. Evacuated areas have reopened, and city officials are assessing minimal damage, with a long-term solution for the ongoing flooding still years away.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revoked a 2021 executive order by Joe Biden designed to promote competition across the U.S. economy, dismantling a key initiative that targeted anti-competitive practices in various sectors. The Justice Department welcomed the move, advocating for an "America first antitrust" approach focused on free markets. Critics argue that Trump's actions, including previous plans to shrink the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have already cost Americans billions in higher fees and lost compensation. Biden's original order aimed to combat excessive industry concentration and market power abuses, particularly in labor and healthcare. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend, known as "bleisure," allows travelers to reclaim family time and enjoy cost savings by combining work with mini-vacations. While companies generally accept this practice, employees often keep their plans discreet due to concerns about professionalism or policy ambiguities regarding expenses and insurance. Experts suggest that as long as business objectives are met and costs are clearly separated, allowing family to join can boost morale and loyalty.</p>

This move paves the way for the families to receive payouts after years of legal battles, with the receiver now empowered to seize property and control Infowars' website.

Importers of natural resources, such as coffee and tea, face limited options to avoid tariffs, as sourcing alternatives are scarce.

          <p>A new study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly reduce the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. The research, based on 148,500 people in Sweden, found that medication, primarily methylphenidate, was linked to reductions in first-time and recurrent instances of these issues. Researchers from Southampton University and the Karolinska Institute believe these benefits are due to medication reducing impulsive behavior and improving concentration. The findings offer crucial evidence for patients considering treatment, despite well-publicized side effects and challenges in accessing medication.</p>

Clinicians often lack prior relationships with patients, leading to inconsistencies in assessments. The widespread awareness of MAID as an option also contributes to its high demand, prompting ongoing philosophical debates about the limits of assisted death.</p>
