          <p>A 57-year-old surfer was fatally attacked by a large shark while surfing with friends near Sydney, Australia. Despite the efforts of fellow surfers who brought him to shore, he succumbed to his injuries, which included the loss of several limbs. The incident, the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 2022, has led to the temporary closure of nearby beaches as authorities use drones to patrol for shark activity. The article notes that while such attacks are rare, this marks another tragic encounter in Australia's waters.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics made a pilgrimage to Rome for the Holy Year, celebrating a newfound sense of welcome within the Catholic Church, a change many attribute to the late Pope Francis. A high-ranking Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing the Jubilee's historical purpose of restoring dignity to marginalized groups. Participants contrasted this experience with past pilgrimages where they felt shunned, highlighting Pope Francis's legacy of inclusion and Pope Leo's intention to continue it. The event signifies a major shift in the church's tone towards its LGBTQ+ members.</p>

          <p>A protest in London against the UK government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization resulted in several arrests. Hundreds gathered in Parliament Square, with many waving Palestinian flags and holding signs opposing the ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense. The Metropolitan Police had warned that showing support for the banned group would lead to arrest. This follows a previous demonstration where over 500 people were arrested for similar acts of support for the campaign group.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has deported a 29-year-old Mexican citizen wanted in his home country on an outstanding warrant for aggravated sexual assault against an underage family member. The man, who had entered the U.S. on a visitor's visa in 2019, overstayed his authorized period by nearly five years. ICE officials stated that their mission is to remove dangerous criminal non-citizens from communities to preserve public safety. The agency also highlighted a separate case involving the deportation of a Jamaican national accused of sexual assault of a child.</p>

          <p>School districts in 35 states are implementing cellphone bans using Yondr pouches, a solution that requires students to lock their phones in a magnetic pouch during the school day. The move aims to reduce classroom distractions and help students re-engage with in-person learning, a sentiment shared by many educators who felt phones were hindering education. While some students and parents have welcomed the change, others have expressed skepticism or tried to circumvent the system. The company behind the pouches reports significant growth as more schools seek to create phone-free educational environments.</p>

          <p>An extended trade truce between the United States and China has created a divide among farmers in the American Midwest. While some remain hopeful that President Trump's approach will eventually lead to increased orders from China, others are concerned about the ongoing drop in exports as Beijing shifts to alternative suppliers like Brazil. Many farmers express frustration over the market's unpredictability and feel they can no longer rely on China as a primary importer of their agricultural goods. The situation highlights the precarious position of U.S. agriculture in the face of geopolitical trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>Self-Made Millionaire Money Coach Explains Why She Chooses to Rent Instead of Buying a House in Cash</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial coach Bernadette Joy, a self-made millionaire, advocates for renting over homeownership, a choice she made after owning four properties. She argues that renting provides greater financial flexibility and has allowed her to grow her net worth faster by investing the proceeds from her home sales. Joy points to the significant hidden costs of homeownership, such as renovations and unexpected repairs, as well as the stress and labor involved in being a landlord. For her, the mobility and reduced mental load of renting have been more conducive to focusing on her businesses and career growth.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals the largely unpublished jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré photographer best known for her street photography. In the 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document the American jazz world, capturing both the rapture of audiences and the deep-seated wariness of the musicians. The article notes that the project, intended to include an essay by Langston Hughes, was abandoned due to McCarthy-era suspicion of her politics. Her photos offer a poignant look at luminaries like Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday, reflecting a shared experience of persecution.</p>

          <p>A viral social media trend, dubbed the "We Do Not Care Club," is giving voice to women who are tired of conforming to societal and male expectations regarding their appearance and behavior. The movement reflects a broader cultural moment where choosing indifference to certain pressures is seen as an act of defiance and a path to a more honest life. The article connects this to the psychological freedom of realizing that people are not judging you as much as you think. This form of "not caring" is framed not as apathy, but as a conscious decision to prioritize what truly matters.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, now a powerful Category 4 storm, is moving west across the Pacific Ocean on a path toward Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are currently in effect, forecasters anticipate that swells from the storm will reach the Hawaiian Islands by the end of the weekend. These swells are expected to generate life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents, with potential direct impacts from wind and rain beginning early next week. In response to the threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to prepare and monitor updates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests the climate crisis will lead to a significant increase in lightning-sparked wildfires across the western U.S. for decades to come. A study using machine learning found that a combination of more frequent lightning and drier, hotter weather conditions will heighten fire risk in 98% of the region. These fires, which often start in remote areas, tend to grow larger and produce more smoke, worsening air quality and public health crises. The trend poses a major challenge for firefighting resources, which are already stretched thin, and could have cascading effects.</p>

          <p>A mother's persistence after her one-year-old son experienced a constant stream of infections led to the diagnosis of a malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and aggressive cancer. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children discovered a grapefruit-sized mass in his liver and developed an individualized treatment plan involving intensive chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Despite the grim prognosis typically associated with this cancer, the toddler has responded well to the treatment and is now in remission. The family is transitioning to a "new normal" while remaining vigilant, celebrating milestones that once seemed uncertain.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reported a landmark test flight of an AI-powered radar system that appears to be immune to electronic jamming. According to a paper from a state-run research institute, the AI-enhanced system maintained a target tracking continuity of over 99%, compared to 70-80% for conventional radar under jamming conditions. The new technology represents a potential paradigm shift in radar design, using artificial intelligence to adapt and overcome interference in real-time.

New developments include an FDA-approved blood test for early Alzheimer's diagnosis and growing evidence from studies like the U.S. POINTER Study that lifestyle interventions can delay or even improve cognitive function. While no cure exists, experts highlight that a combination of physical activity, a healthy diet, brain exercises, and social engagement can reduce risk factors. These breakthroughs offer new hope for millions as the number of dementia cases is projected to double by 2060.</p>

The article notes the political turmoil benefits the rival Reform UK party, which frames both major parties as part of a broken system. Key changes in Starmer's government include promoting Shabana Mahmood to Home Secretary, tasked with addressing the small boats crisis, and moving Yvette Cooper to Foreign Secretary. The reshuffle is seen as an attempt by Downing Street to regain control and push forward its agenda after a politically damaging episode.</p>
