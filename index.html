The band expressed their shock and sadness, offering condolences to the man's family and friends. Authorities are appealing for witnesses who may have captured the incident on their phones, as the stadium was very busy for one of the band's seven sold-out reunion shows.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion, with England needing 35 more runs and India requiring four wickets to win. Play was halted on the fourth day due to rain and bad light, leaving the series outcome on a knife-edge. Centuries from England's Harry Brook and Joe Root had put them in a strong position before a late comeback from India's bowlers created a tense finale.

          <p>The White House is defending the decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report with downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the revisions as "hard evidence" of issues, suggesting a need for "more transparent and more reliable" data under a new appointee. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn it could undermine public trust in government data and sets a dangerous precedent. The firing occurred after the latest report showed weaker-than-expected job growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Mexico's Democratic Governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, has strongly criticized the new federal healthcare law, calling its provisions, particularly the work requirements for Medicaid, practically impossible to implement. She argued the law creates immense paperwork burdens and threatens the stability of rural hospitals, projecting a potential loss of over $12 billion for her state. The governor contended that the proposed $50 billion Rural Health Care Fund is insufficient to prevent hundreds of hospitals nationwide from closing, describing the overall $900 billion cut from Medicaid as "catastrophic."

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat, an incident which also threw a passenger overboard. The passenger is reportedly unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, the carcass will be moved on Monday for a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death. Boaters are being advised to use caution in the area.</p>

          <p>A self-imposed deadline for a new US-Canada trade agreement has passed without a resolution, leaving businesses in a state of uncertainty. Despite recent intense negotiations, ongoing tariff disputes and political tensions, including President Trump's criticism of Canada's stance on Palestinian statehood, have stalled progress. While Canada faces a 35% tariff rate on some goods, nearly 90% of its exports to the US remain duty-free under the existing CUSMA/USMCA agreement, providing a buffer. Officials from both countries indicate that talks will continue in the coming days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has caused a large fire at an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, according to Russian officials. The governor of the Krasnodar region stated that drone debris struck a fuel tank, requiring a major response from firefighters. This attack is part of a broader Ukrainian campaign targeting Russia's energy infrastructure. Russia's defense ministry reported intercepting 93 Ukrainian drones overnight across several regions, while Ukraine reported shooting down 61 of 83 drones and missiles launched by Russia.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has downplayed a public trade request from star defensive end Micah Parsons, attributing it to "negotiation talk." The dispute stems from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in NFL history. While Parsons has yet to practice at training camp due to a back injury, Jones insists an agreement framework is in place and expressed confidence that the situation will be resolved, urging fans not to worry.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has sparked condemnation after visiting and openly praying at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a violation of the long-standing status quo agreement. The site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, is sacred to both Muslims and Jews, and non-Muslim prayer is forbidden there. The visit was called an "unacceptable provocation" by Jordan and a "deepening of aggressions" by Hamas. The Israeli prime minister's office stated there has been no change in policy regarding the sensitive holy site.</p>

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney's 2024 registration as a Republican voter in Florida has become public amid a social media controversy surrounding her new ad campaign for American Eagle. The campaign, which uses the pun "great genes," drew criticism from some for being tone-deaf in the current political climate, while conservatives praised it as a blow against "woke" advertising. This comes two years after Sweeney faced backlash over photos from a family party where guests wore hats resembling MAGA apparel. The actor has not commented on her voter registration.</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV as part of a military anniversary series showed what looked like a successful launch, a key milestone for the vessel. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern technology, which allows for launching heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump ramps on its other carriers. The ship is expected to officially enter service with the People's Liberation Army Navy later this year.</p>

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling statements and factual errors, have renewed expert concerns about his mental acuity. The article cites several instances, including unprompted rants about windmills and a confabulated story about his uncle and the Unabomber, as examples of digressive and incoherent thinking. While the White House dismisses these concerns, some mental health professionals have pointed to a noticeable deterioration from his past speaking patterns. This scrutiny follows a period where similar questions were intensely focused on his political rivals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce attorneys suggest two key strategies for protecting personal finances within a marriage, especially if the relationship becomes unstable. The first is maintaining full awareness and access to all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities to ensure transparency. The second is considering a postnuptial agreement, which functions like a prenup but is created after the wedding, to define how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. These steps can provide security and clarity for both partners should the marriage end.</p>

          <p>A new report has identified several mid-sized U.S. cities as leading hubs for employment and income growth, challenging the dominance of major coastal metropolises. Raleigh, North Carolina, topped the list, followed by Nashville, Austin, and Salt Lake City. The ranking, based on metrics like labor force growth, unemployment rates, and household income, highlights the shifting geography of opportunity in the country. Researchers note that while salaries may be lower than in cities like New York or LA, the affordability of these mid-sized areas means money often goes further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships shares seven calming phrases that can help manage a child's tantrums by fostering connection rather than control. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" validate their emotions and make them feel safe. This approach, which focuses on emotional attunement, helps a child's nervous system regulate more quickly and builds long-term trust and emotional resilience.</p>

The scheme, which could be operational within weeks, may allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the UK for free treatment. This official government initiative follows smaller, privately-funded evacuations organized by charities. The move comes after a Foreign Affairs Committee report criticized the government for previously declining to support such a medical evacuation program.</p>
