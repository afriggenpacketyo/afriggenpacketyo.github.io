          <p>Amidst a volatile stock market influenced by President Trump's actions and trade uncertainties, investing legend Warren Buffett advises investors to be "fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." Buffett suggests that turbulent times present opportunities to buy stocks, which is what he did during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts warn of continued market turbulence due to the administration's unpredictable economic policies, making Buffett's straightforward guideline a potentially valuable strategy for navigating uncertain times.

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter results revealed disappointing sales and profit figures, prompting investors to question CEO Elon Musk's focus on his role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Analysts suggest Musk's actions could permanently reduce demand for Tesla vehicles, urging him to refocus on his role as CEO.

          <p>The US Army will require a fitness test with identical physical standards for men and women in combat positions, following Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's order to eliminate gender-based fitness requirements. This policy change is expected to significantly reduce the number of women qualifying for these roles. The new test includes deadlifts, push-ups, planks, a two-mile run, and a sprint-drag-carry exercise. Soldiers failing to meet the standards face potential removal or transfer to non-combat roles.</p>

          <p>US stocks rebounded strongly, with the Dow rising 1,000 points, after a previous day's sell-off triggered by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The market's recovery indicates resilience among investors, who had initially reacted negatively to Trump's remarks and uncertainty regarding trade policies. Despite the positive day, concerns persist about Trump's trade war, as the IMF lowered the US growth forecast, citing escalating trade tensions. The dollar index steadied after hitting a three-year low, while Treasury yields continued to climb.</p>
