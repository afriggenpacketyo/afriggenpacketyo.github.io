          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, showed prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate in July, unchanged from June. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, increased to 2.9%, its highest level since February, indicating persistent underlying price pressures. The report also revealed a 0.5% rise in consumer spending, suggesting that Americans continue to purchase goods and services despite economic uncertainty. These figures present a complex picture for the Federal Reserve as it weighs future interest rate decisions against its 2% inflation target. (not investment advice)</p>

Nearly 100 personnel conducted a grid search across 250 acres of dense wilderness near the Rock Island Campground, where the girls' bodies were found in June. While officials did not disclose the nature of the items recovered, they are being analyzed for connections to the case.

The confrontation occurred between Alejandro Moreno of the opposition PRI party and Gerardo Fernández Noroña of the ruling Morena party. Tensions flared over accusations that opposition parties were inviting U.S. intervention, a claim they denied. The incident, which involved shoving and shouting, has led to threats of criminal complaints and calls for the lawmakers' expulsion.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the storm is remembered as one of the costliest and deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history, causing nearly 1,400 deaths. The catastrophe was severely exacerbated by the failure of the levee system in New Orleans, which led to at least 80% of the city being flooded. This retrospective examines the initial storm, the subsequent humanitarian crisis at locations like the Superdome, and the heavily criticized slow federal response. Many communities, particularly the Lower Ninth Ward, have yet to fully recover from the widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported stronger-than-expected profits for the June quarter, largely due to accelerated growth in its cloud computing unit, which saw a 26% year-over-year revenue increase. The company attributed this surge to robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Despite overall revenues falling slightly short of analyst forecasts, the impressive performance of the cloud division and a revival in e-commerce prompted a 10% rise in Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares.

          <p>The Chinese government has strongly condemned a visit by U.S. Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer to Taiwan, labeling it a serious violation of the "one-China principle." A foreign ministry spokesman stated that the visit undermines China's sovereignty and sends a wrongful signal to what it calls "separatist forces." Beijing urged Washington to cease all official exchanges with Taiwan and avoid actions that could heighten tensions in the region. The visit occurs at a sensitive time, with ongoing trade discussions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent President Donald Trump from removing her from the central bank's board. The lawsuit argues that the president's attempt to fire her is illegal and based on pretextual allegations regarding her personal mortgage applications. This legal challenge represents a significant test of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference. The case highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and the central bank over economic policy and personnel. </p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has lodged a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This new referral alleges misrepresentations related to a third property and government ethics filings made during her tenure at the Fed. The action escalates the conflict as President Trump cites these allegations as cause for her dismissal. Cook's legal team has described the move as a politically motivated smear campaign intended to justify her removal from the board.</p>

          <p>This article outlines an ongoing project by The Guardian to track and visualize key immigration enforcement data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Using bi-weekly data releases, the initiative monitors the number of arrests, detentions, and deportations carried out under the Trump administration. The project aims to provide the public with a quantitative analysis of the administration's immigration policies by systematically archiving and comparing official statistics over time. The methodology for processing the data is also explained.</p>

          <p>This article reviews the book "Such Great Heights," offering a cultural analysis of the indie rock movement that gained prominence in the 2000s. It explores how bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse transitioned from niche scenes to mainstream awareness, aided by the internet and a cultural shift towards more subtle and complex music. The piece reflects on how the "indie" label evolved from a distribution method to a broader aesthetic, influencing mainstream pop artists and shaping the musical tastes of a generation before the era of streaming algorithms transformed music discovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government proceeded with the largest reorganization of English councils in decades without commissioning its own independent cost-benefit analysis, the BBC has learned. The Ministry of Local Government based its projection of £2.9 billion in savings on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its findings, now suggesting that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings or even incur additional costs. This revelation has drawn criticism, with opponents questioning the financial justification for such a significant structural change.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced that no official Israeli government delegation will be invited to the DSEI defence exhibition in London next month. The decision was made in response to what the UK described as Israel's "wrong" decision to escalate its military operation in Gaza. While private Israeli defense companies can still attend, Israel's defense ministry condemned the move as a "deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination." This action reflects growing international pressure on Israel and a deepening diplomatic rift between the two allies over the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>Relations between Kyiv and Budapest have become increasingly tense after Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia disrupted Hungary's oil supply. Hungarian officials condemned the attack as a threat to Europe's energy security, while Ukraine maintains its actions are aimed at undermining Russia's war economy. The conflict highlights Hungary's significant dependence on Russian oil, a vulnerability that has been exposed by the ongoing war. The dispute is further complicated by Hungary's blocking of Ukraine's EU accession talks, adding a political dimension to the energy security issue.</p>
