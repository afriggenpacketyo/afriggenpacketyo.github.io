          <h2>Cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' Sparks Questions About the Future of Late-Night Television</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 13:29:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is fueling debate about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While the network cites financial pressures amid declining linear TV ad revenue and viewership, some industry observers question the timing, noting it followed Colbert's criticism of Paramount. The move puts a spotlight on the high production costs of these shows versus their shifting revenue streams, with Disney's upcoming decision on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" seen as the next major indicator for the genre's future. Analysts note that while late-night ratings are falling, digital engagement on platforms like YouTube remains a significant, though complex, part of their financial equation.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators has formally requested the Trump administration to cease funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed aid organization. Citing "grave" concerns over the GHF's operations, which have been linked to hundreds of civilian deaths, the senators are advocating for a return to UN-led aid distribution with enhanced oversight. The letter highlights a $30 million US pledge to the GHF and questions whether standard oversight protocols were bypassed as the humanitarian crisis and risk of starvation in Gaza intensify. This call for action is echoed by international allies like France, who have also criticized the GHF's methods.</p>

          <p>Chinese swimming prodigy Yu Zidi, aged just 12, made her international debut at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. She competed in the 200-meter individual medley, successfully advancing to the semifinals with the 15th fastest qualifying time. Born in October 2012, Yu began swimming at age six and nearly qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics. While World Aquatics typically has a minimum competition age of 14, exceptions are made for younger athletes who meet the stringent qualifying standards. If Yu medals, she will be the youngest swimmer to do so since the 1936 Berlin Olympics.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought outlined the administration's priorities, including seeking a new Federal Reserve chair who will lower interest rates more quickly.

He confirmed that the administration is considering using rescissions to claw back more funds and did not rule out a government shutdown to achieve its fiscal goals, stating the current bipartisan appropriations process is broken and leads to excessive spending.

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a limited, daily "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to be distributed amid a deepening hunger crisis. The move comes after mounting international pressure and graphic images of starving children, with food experts warning of famine.

          <p>India's batters delivered a remarkable rearguard performance to secure a draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, keeping the series alive at 2-1. Facing a large deficit, India batted for over five sessions, with captain Shubman Gill scoring a resilient 103 before Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar added their own centuries. England's bowlers, led by an ailing but determined Ben Stokes, toiled on a largely unresponsive pitch but were frustrated by India's defense and a critical dropped catch. Both teams face fatigue and injury concerns heading into the final, decisive Test at The Oval next week.</p>

Despite the demonstrations, security kept protestors at a distance from the president's golf group.</p>

          <h2>Cybersecurity Experts Warn of Rising 'Quishing' Scams Using Malicious QR Codes</h2>

          <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly using QR codes for phishing scams, a tactic known as "quishing," to dupe millions of Americans. Attackers place fake QR code stickers on everything from parking meters to mail, tricking people into visiting malicious websites that steal personal and financial information or install malware. The ubiquity and convenience of QR codes, which accelerated during the pandemic, have made them an attractive tool for hackers. Experts warn that users often can't verify the destination of a QR link, making it a low-effort, high-return tactic for criminals as traditional email phishing becomes more difficult.</p>

          <p>Senior U.S. officials have reportedly seen schematics for refitting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet donated by the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One. President Trump confirmed the gift earlier this year, stating it would be used for a few years while new official planes are built, and then donated to his presidential library. The arrangement has drawn scrutiny over constitutional rules preventing a president from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. The plane, valued at $400 million, will require extensive and costly security checks and renovations before it can be put into service.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable professional debut, 21-year-old English golfer Lottie Woad won the Women's Scottish Open with a final-round 68. Woad entered the final day with a two-shot lead and held off a strong field, finishing at 21 under par, three strokes clear of her nearest competitor. The victory marks her second tour win, with the first coming as an amateur. Just last week, Woad turned professional after narrowly missing a major championship playoff. The win earns her £220,000 in prize money and establishes her as a strong contender for next week's Women's Open.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a BBC analysis, Israel's recent announcement of aid airdrops and a "tactical pause" in Gaza is likely a gesture to international allies who have condemned the starvation and humanitarian catastrophe in the territory. The measures follow strong statements from the UK, France, and Germany demanding Israel lift aid restrictions. However, the UN and other agencies view the Israeli-backed GHF aid system as inhumane and militarized, with over 1,000 Palestinians reportedly shot dead trying to access its sites. Experts consider airdrops a desperate and inefficient last resort, arguing that only a full ceasefire and unrestricted land access can truly address the crisis.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Beijing and Washington are set to extend their current tariff pause for an additional 90 days during trade talks in Stockholm. The original 90-day truce, agreed upon in May, was set to expire in mid-August. While the extension will prevent an immediate escalation of the trade war, insiders do not expect breakthroughs on major issues like China's industrial overcapacity. Instead, the talks are expected to focus on clarifying positions, with the Chinese delegation reportedly planning to press the U.S. on its threshold for easing tariffs related to fentanyl trafficking.

          <p>A protest on the Greek island of Syros against an Israeli cruise ship has ignited a heated national debate about the conflict in Gaza and antisemitism. About 300 demonstrators with Palestinian flags prompted the cruise line to prevent its 1,600 passengers from disembarking. The incident has polarized opinions in Greece, reflecting a broader societal divide where support for Israel has declined since the start of the war. While the Greek government maintains a strong pro-Israel alliance, opinion polls show growing public sympathy for the Palestinian cause, particularly among left-leaning voters, creating a complex political landscape.</p>

The operation demonstrates a strategic focus on defending allied assets and deterring aggression in the increasingly contested domain of space.

          <p>A financial columnist analyzes the new "Trump IRA," a savings account for children under 18 established in a recent bill. The plan allows for up to $5,000 in annual contributions and includes a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born within a specific timeframe. While the author suggests taking the free government money, he argues that other investment vehicles like 529 education plans and whole life insurance policies offer more significant long-term benefits. The article concludes that while the new IRA has good intentions, parents can achieve better returns for their children's futures through more established strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research on four-day workweek trials, the resulting boost in employee happiness stems from more than just having an extra day off. Lead researcher Juliet Schor explains that a primary factor is that workers feel more effective and productive in their roles. Faced with completing their work in 32 hours, teams are motivated to eliminate inefficiencies, streamline processes, and focus on high-impact tasks. This heightened sense of accomplishment and control over their work contributes significantly to overall well-being. The shared goal of maintaining productivity in less time also fosters better teamwork and a stronger sense of shared purpose among colleagues.</p>
