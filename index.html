          <p>South Korean workers detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-affiliated plant in Georgia may have their return home postponed due to unspecified issues on the US side. The raid, which detained over 300 South Korean nationals, has caused diplomatic concern in Seoul, especially given the timing of sensitive trade talks between the two allies. South Korean officials are in discussions with the US to expedite the workers' departure, while the White House has defended the operation as a necessary enforcement of immigration laws.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is exploring the complex cultural legacy of the 'Plattenbau,' the prefabricated concrete apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to postwar housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of social decay and extremism following German reunification. The exhibition uses art to revisit the multifaceted history of these structures, examining them as spaces of collective memory, social change, and painful transformation.</p>

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever vaccine designed to combat a widespread chlamydia epidemic that has been devastating the nation's endangered koala population. Developed over more than a decade by university scientists, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to reduce the likelihood of symptoms and decrease mortality by at least 65%. This approval marks a major milestone in conservation efforts, offering a critical tool to help save the iconic species from one of its biggest threats.</p>

          <p>The congressional release of a 50th birthday book for Jeffrey Epstein from 2003 has revealed disturbing content, including crude jokes, lewd drawings, and sexually explicit messages from his powerful friends and associates. The document, which includes a now-infamous message from Donald Trump, paints a sickening picture of how Epstein's predatory sexual behavior was apparently an open secret within his elite circle. The tributes suggest his behavior was not only known but was often treated as a source of amusement.</p>

          <p>The recently released 238-page birthday scrapbook for Jeffrey Epstein offers a disturbing look into his social circle before his crimes became public. Key takeaways include the confirmation of a crude message allegedly from Donald Trump, a running theme of highly sexualized jokes and encounters throughout the book, and new questions about the timeline of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell. The documents underscore how widely known Epstein's lewd behavior was among his associates, who appeared to treat it as a subject for humor.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeted a residential compound in Doha, Qatar, in what it called a 'precise strike' against senior Hamas leadership. Hamas confirmed that five of its members were killed in the attack but claimed that its negotiating team, which was meeting at the site, survived the assassination attempt. The strike was condemned by Qatar as a 'flagrant violation of international law,' and it represents a major escalation of the conflict into the territory of a key regional mediator.</p>

          <p>Two former safety researchers from Meta testified before a US Senate committee, alleging that the company actively covered up potential harms to children related to its virtual reality (VR) products. The whistleblowers claimed that Meta's lawyers intervened to shape internal research and that they were instructed to avoid work that could produce evidence of negative experiences for young users. They also alleged that evidence of sexual abuse risks on VR platforms was deliberately buried by the company.</p>

          <p>China's top legislative body is reviewing a new draft law aimed at promoting 'ethnic unity and progress' by fostering a stronger sense of a unified national identity. A key component of the legislation is the emphasis on promoting the use of Mandarin, the common national language, across the country. The law also seeks to encourage more interethnic exchanges through cultural, educational, and tourism initiatives as part of a broader push for social and cultural integration.</p>
