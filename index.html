          <p>China's middle class is grappling with investment anxieties as traditional safe havens like real estate, US dollars, and Hong Kong stocks become increasingly volatile. Many Chinese investors, accustomed to steady economic growth, are now facing the challenge of preserving their wealth in a turbulent market. One individual, Eric Li, sold his flat with minimal profit after 12 years and is unsure where to reinvest the proceeds. This reflects a broader sentiment of uncertainty among Chinese investors seeking stable investment options.

          <p>Five international students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst had their visas revoked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), raising concerns about the treatment of foreign students. The university was not notified in advance and discovered the revocations through routine database checks. Other universities, including Arizona State and Cornell, have reported similar incidents, leading to speculation that students involved in protests are being targeted. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated that students are being targeted for involvement in protests along with others tied to "potential criminal activity."</p>

          <p>The Midwest and South are bracing for additional flash flooding after a series of severe storms and tornadoes caused widespread damage and fatalities.

          <p>China's economic engagement with Africa has significantly increased, marking a major shift in global alliances. Trade between China and Africa grew nearly 5% year-on-year in 2024, fueled by initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. Despite China's domestic economic slowdown, the relationship is evolving towards public-private partnerships and diversified trade, with Africa exporting more non-resource goods to China. This evolving partnership is reshaping economic power dynamics on the continent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, arguing that the judge lacked the authority to issue such an order. Government lawyers claim they have no control over the man and no authority to arrange his return. The White House continues to characterize the man as an MS-13 gang member, while his attorneys deny this claim.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. While the IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, it admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. Israel initially claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached "suspiciously" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights, which was later proven false by video footage.</p>
