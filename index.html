          <p>Joe McCallen, a 63-year-old from Tampa Bay, has driven 100,000 miles in three years for Google Street View, capturing panoramic images of Midwest and East Coast roads. This New York Times article details McCallen's experiences, from encountering moose to unexpected Northern Lights sightings. The initial Street View model in 2007 used socks to prevent condensation on cameras, but now planes, satellites, and user-submitted images contribute to the platform. Google is also working on AI to glean business information from Street View images, and McCallen plans to continue his work, embracing the flexibility and unique experiences it offers.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how U.S. inflation cooled slightly in April, but economists predict a surge in consumer prices due to President Trump's trade war. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3 percent annually, the slowest pace since early 2021, but experts believe this is a temporary lull. Tariffs on imports are expected to drive prices up, although the full impact may take months to materialize as companies deplete existing inventories. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation to ensure long-term inflation expectations remain stable.</p>

          <p>This DW article explores how the Czech Republic's arms production is surging, potentially replacing the automotive industry as the country's main economic driver. While car manufacturing experienced a 7.1% decline in early 2025 due to decreased Western demand, the arms industry is thriving, with 90% of its output exported. The Ukraine war has fueled this growth, leading to increased production of ammunition, military vehicles, and other defense equipment. The arms industry is creating new jobs for automotive employees, with minimal retraining needed.</p>

The administration has also disbanded a Justice Department unit investigating cryptocurrency crimes and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This CBS News article reports that a tariff truce between the U.S. and China will provide some economic relief but prolongs uncertainty for businesses. Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, and China will reduce its tariff on American goods to 10%. Experts warn that clinching a long-term trade deal will be challenging, and the reduced tariff rate could still lead to consumer price hikes. The truce is expected to improve consumer confidence and contain U.S. inflation, reducing the odds of a recession this year.</p>

The country's new finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, presented the plan to Brussels, aiming to boost growth. However, the scale of the spending puts Germany on a potential collision course with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact. While Germany argues the plans fall within revised rules allowing flexibility for defense, critics warn it could set a dangerous precedent and weaken fiscal discipline across the bloc.</p>

          <p>The Guardian reports that the pace of inflation slowed in April, coinciding with President Trump's tariffs. The annual inflation rate was 2.3%, down from 2.4% in March, but businesses are still assessing the tariffs' impact. While Trump has rolled back some tariffs, a 30% levy remains on Chinese imports, and most other US imports face a 10% levy. Consumer sentiment dropped in April, and inflation expectations rose, but economists expect price increases to worsen this year as companies adjust to the new tariffs.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is selling 80 shares of Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) to partially offset the initiation of a new position in GE Vernova. The decision comes as shares of the steak restaurant chain have rallied due to improved comparable store sales and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. The club lowered its price target for Texas Roadhouse to $195, citing increased margin pressure from rising beef prices, and is downgrading the stock to a 2 rating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A British man, Peter Sullivan, who served 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sidwell, has had his conviction overturned by the UK Court of Appeal, as reported by DW. New DNA evidence from semen samples found on the victim's body indicated that the killer was not Sullivan. Sullivan's conviction was based on a retracted confession and bite mark evidence that has since been discredited. He is believed to be the UK's longest-serving victim of a miscarriage of justice.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, according to CBS News, which was less than economists expected and reflects price hikes that remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. On a month-over-month basis, the CPI rose 0.2%. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation last month, and energy costs also ticked higher. Economists are watching for signs that President Trump's tariffs are impacting American households, although the effects may take a few months to appear in economic data.</p>

          <p>ABC News reports that consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, cooling slightly from the previous month, defying fears of an inflation surge after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs.

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Thomas B. Edsall explores the concept of corruption in the age of Trump, examining how his alleged self-dealing and flouting of norms resonate with his base. Political scientists argue that Trump's brazenness and lack of shame are perceived as strengths by his supporters, who see him as an outsider fighting against a corrupt system. The essay also considers how Democrats' efforts to address inequality may inadvertently reinforce perceptions of favoritism, contributing to populist narratives.</p>
