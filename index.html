          <p>U.S. stocks saw their most significant drop in months after former President Trump indicated he might impose more tariffs on Chinese goods. The S&P 500 fell by 2.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 879 points, reflecting investor anxiety over renewed trade tensions. The selloff was also influenced by concerns that the market was overvalued and recent data showing a decline in consumer confidence, affecting a wide range of companies from technology to smaller firms.

          <p>In a direct response to planned U.S. port fees, China's Ministry of Transport has imposed its own fees on American-owned, operated, or flagged ships docking in the country. The new charges, which mirror the structure of the U.S. tariffs, are set to begin on October 14th. This move is part of a series of countermeasures from Beijing ahead of a potential meeting between the two nations' leaders, further escalating the ongoing trade dispute between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>In a surprising move, French President Emmanuel Macron has asked Sébastien Lecornu to return as prime minister just four days after he resigned from the position. The reappointment comes during a period of intense political instability in France, driven by deep divisions over the national budget and debt reduction. Lecornu now faces the immediate challenge of forming a government and presenting a budget to a parliament where Macron's party lacks a majority, a task that has toppled previous prime ministers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated permanent layoffs of federal workers, referred to as "Reductions in Force" (RIFs), as the government shutdown extends into its tenth day. OMB Director Russell Vought confirmed the move, which has been sharply criticized by lawmakers from both parties and federal employee unions. The Department of Health and Human Services is among the agencies affected, with officials stating that only employees designated as non-essential have received layoff notices.</p>

          <p>Following a recent agreement between Israel and Hamas, questions have arisen about Turkey's late but significant involvement in the negotiation process. Turkish President Erdoğan reportedly helped persuade Hamas to accept the deal at the request of the U.S., leveraging Ankara's long-standing relationship with the group. Turkey is now expected to participate in a task force to implement the peace plan, potentially assisting in locating the remains of Israeli hostages and playing a key diplomatic role.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has secured a deal with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to reduce the cost of its drugs for U.S. consumers, according to reports. The agreement is expected to follow a model similar to a recent pact with Pfizer, where the company will sell drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. This is part of President Trump's broader effort to pressure drugmakers to lower prices and increase manufacturing within the United States.</p>

          <p>An ICE official testified in federal court regarding the Trump administration's plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year and then returned to the U.S. to face charges. The administration is now seeking to remove him to a third country, with Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and Ghana being considered, though Ghana has publicly refused to accept him. A federal judge has currently blocked his removal as legal proceedings continue over the complex and controversial immigration case.</p>

          <p>Chicha, a unique musical genre from Peru, represents a complex fusion of cultural influences that emerged from the mass migration of Indigenous Andean people to Lima. The sound blends Colombian cumbia, Andean huayno, and psychedelic rock, with a prominent electric guitar, and became the voice of a marginalized migrant community in the 1980s. Artists like Chacalón and Los Shapis brought chicha to the masses, and today it remains a vital and celebrated part of Peru's popular culture and identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent decision to exert direct pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the crucial factor in achieving a new ceasefire agreement with Hamas. After months of allowing the conflict to continue, Trump's personal investment in a peace deal, reportedly spurred by an Israeli attack in Qatar, led to a tense phone call where he pushed a reluctant Netanyahu to accept the terms. The author suggests sustained U.S. pressure will be necessary to prevent the agreement from collapsing.</p>

          <p>A leader of the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo has threatened to overthrow President Felix Tshisekedi's government, escalating rhetoric ahead of new peace talks. The rebels, who control significant territory in the eastern part of the country, have reportedly been training thousands of new recruits. While some analysts view the threat as posturing to gain leverage in negotiations, it highlights the fragile security situation and the current impasse in the peace process.</p>
