          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:10:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An 18-year-old has been jailed for six years after admitting to plotting a mass shooting at his Edinburgh school. The court heard that the teenager, who was 15 and 16 when the offenses occurred, idolized the Columbine High School killers and had spent over 1,000 hours in contact with a pro-Nazi online group. Police uncovered his detailed plans, journal entries describing his school as a "virus," and a collection of files on homemade firearms and poisons. The judge stated that the teenager was progressing towards perpetrating the attack before his arrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently freed British-Israeli hostage has publicly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's proposal to recognize a Palestinian state. She argued that such a move would risk rewarding terrorism and send a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy, comparing it to recognizing Nazi control during WWII. This statement reflects concerns from other hostage families who fear the policy could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining captives. They are urging the government to clarify that no substantive steps will be taken until all hostages are freed.</p>

          <p>A group of eight Senate Democrats is using a little-known federal law to formally request that the Justice Department turn over its criminal investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. Citing a statute that allows five members of the Senate Governmental Affairs panel to request such information, they have set an August 15 deadline. This move escalates pressure on the Trump administration, which Democrats accuse of reneging on earlier promises to declassify and release the files. The Justice Department has confirmed receipt of the letter but has not commented further.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans, including those with six-figure incomes, are struggling to pay their debts, according to new data from VantageScore. Delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans have more than doubled since 2023 for households earning over $150,000, signaling widespread financial pressure due to inflation and high interest rates. The trend is partly attributed to a slowdown in the creation of high-wage white-collar jobs. The article suggests several strategies for managing debt, such as negotiating interest rates and consolidating loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, surpassing forecasts and reversing a 0.5% contraction from the first three months of the year. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a volatile factor influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, rather than underlying economic strength. While consumer spending saw a modest increase, a key measure of private domestic demand slowed, suggesting that the economy is cooling despite the strong headline number. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans in the Texas legislature have unveiled a proposed new congressional map that could secure them up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. The aggressive gerrymander, drawn during a special session called at the urging of President Trump, would consolidate Democratic voters in some areas and shift boundaries in others to favor GOP candidates. Democrats have denounced the map as a racially discriminatory power grab and have already threatened fierce legal challenges, setting the stage for a major political and legal battle over redistricting.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reportedly considering a run for governor of Tennessee, a move that would require him to resign from his cabinet post. This news comes amid continued turmoil at the Pentagon, including an upcoming watchdog report on the "Signalgate" fiasco where Hegseth inadvertently leaked military plans. Sources claim he has discussed the eligibility requirements and realities of a campaign, while the Pentagon insists his focus remains on his current role. The situation highlights instability and internal strife within the Department of Defense.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why President Trump's Campaign Against Fed Chair Powell Is Unlikely to Succeed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 11:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article explores President Trump's high-pressure campaign to force Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates or resign. It explains that the Fed's structural independence is designed to prevent such political interference, which historically leads to long-term inflation. The author argues that if Trump were to succeed in ousting Powell, the resulting market chaos would likely drive interest rates higher, the opposite of his desired outcome. The situation serves as a clear illustration of why central bank independence is a critical stabilizing economic force.</p>

          <p>Following Starbucks' recent earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to buy the company's stock, framing its post-earnings price drop as a valuable opportunity. He expressed strong confidence in CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround strategy, comparing his current feeling about Starbucks to his previous optimism about Chipotle before its major stock run-up. Cramer believes the market is overlooking the positive signs of recovery and that the current share price does not reflect the company's long-term potential under its new leadership.

          <p>Following the release of data showing the U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual pace, President Donald Trump immediately called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. In a social media post, he used the better-than-expected GDP figure to intensify his public pressure campaign against Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The article notes that while the headline number was strong, it was significantly skewed by a sharp drop in imports related to tariff policies, while other indicators point to a cooling economy.

The proposed tariffs are partly seen as retaliation for the prosecution of Trump's ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges related to an alleged coup plot, a matter Lula insists is non-negotiable.

          <p>Europe's ability to meet its climate goals is at risk because its forests are absorbing significantly less carbon dioxide, according to a new scientific paper. Researchers found that the amount of CO2 removed by forests annually from 2020-2022 was nearly a third lower than a decade prior. This decline is attributed to increased logging, wildfires, drought, and pest outbreaks. The findings are a major concern for the EU, whose net-zero emissions strategy relies heavily on forests acting as a growing carbon sink to offset industrial pollution.</p>

          <p>In the deep, dark trenches of the northwest Pacific, scientists have discovered a vibrant and extensive ecosystem thriving without sunlight. These communities, found at depths greater than 31,000 feet, are dominated by tube worms and clams that derive their energy from chemical reactions, a process called chemosynthesis. They are nourished by hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the seafloor. This groundbreaking discovery extends the known depth limit for such life by nearly 25% and shows how life can flourish in Earth's most extreme environments.</p>
