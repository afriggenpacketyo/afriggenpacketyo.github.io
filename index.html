          <p>Ian Watkins, the former lead singer of the Welsh rock band Lostprophets, has died after being attacked in prison. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for numerous child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. West Yorkshire Police are investigating the incident, which reportedly involved another inmate, as a homicide. His death concludes a case that judges described as plunging into "new depths of depravity," with police inquiries ongoing at the scene.</p>

The blast at Accurate Energetic Systems on Friday morning left 18 people unaccounted for, and the mission has now shifted from rescue to recovery. The sheriff described the scene as one of the most devastating he has ever witnessed, with the building completely gone and debris scattered over a wide area.

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced its worst single-day decline since April after President Trump announced new tariff threats against China. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell sharply on Friday, erasing gains from earlier in the week. Trump's announcement included an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports and new export controls on critical software, citing the need to counter China's own restrictions on rare earth minerals. The market turbulence overshadowed a significant week for tech companies like Nvidia, which saw stock fluctuations amid major AI-related deals and announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI's aggressive growth and massive investments are creating an unprecedented level of dominance in the tech industry, leaving startups and venture capitalists questioning where opportunities remain. The company is investing heavily across the entire technology stack, from data center infrastructure in partnership with Nvidia to consumer applications like its Sora video generator. Unlike previous tech giants, OpenAI's private status allows it to spend vast sums without public market scrutiny, leading to a "gold rush mentality" among AI startups. This rapid expansion is forcing entrepreneurs to seek niche markets to avoid direct competition with the AI goliath.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have officially backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan hinges on the SNP winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. The party rejected an alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto vote on independence itself, opting instead to pursue a formal referendum, which would still require approval from the UK government.</p>

The current impasse centers on disagreements over healthcare policy, specifically funding for the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. While essential services like border protection and air traffic control continue, the shutdown has significant economic consequences for workers and can disrupt public services like national parks.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America, viewing it as a strong platform to advance their careers and gain national team recognition. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek highlight that MLS offers high-quality competition and visibility, challenging the misconception in Australia that European leagues are the only viable overseas option. The league is not only a springboard for players but also provides professional opportunities for coaches and staff, like LA Galaxy's Head of Strength and Conditioning, Adam Waterson. This trend reflects MLS's evolving strategy of developing and selling talented international players.</p>

          <p>According to BlackRock, investors are increasingly moving away from traditional, broad technology sector funds and into more targeted, thematic ETFs focused on artificial intelligence. Jay Jacobs, the firm's U.S. head of equity ETFs, notes that funds like BlackRock's BAI are attracting capital by offering specific exposure to the entire AI ecosystem, from semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia to large language models. A similar trend is seen in blockchain-related stocks, with strong interest in Ethereum and actively managed funds that invest in companies developing blockchain infrastructure. This shift indicates a desire for more granular investment strategies within the rapidly evolving tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a television appearance, President Donald Trump made a series of mathematically impossible claims regarding future reductions in prescription drug prices. While recounting his first-term achievement of lowering drug prices by a fraction of a percent, he asserted that prices would soon be going down by "100 percent, 400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent in some cases." A price reduction of 100 percent would make a product free, and any reduction greater than that is not possible. He stated that these supposed reductions would have a massive positive impact on programs like Social Security and Medicare.</p>

Berkshire has continued to increase its stakes, recently raising its ownership in Mitsui and Mitsubishi to over 10%.

Israel's initial list of 250 prisoners to be freed excluded these high-profile names, who are seen by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance. The disagreement could potentially complicate the timeline for the exchange, which is a key component of the first phase of the U.S.-brokered deal to end the war in Gaza. Twenty Israeli hostages are expected to be released by Monday, along with the bodies of deceased hostages.</p>

The new solid-fuel missile, described as the nation's "most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system," was displayed on large 11-axle launcher trucks.

          <p>A proposal by the U.S. Department of Transportation to prohibit Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace on U.S. routes could lead to higher operational costs and potential flight cancellations. U.S. officials argue that using Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair advantage with shorter flight times. Aviation analysts suggest that if the ban is implemented, Chinese airlines would face a choice between absorbing higher costs by re-routing flights and raising ticket prices, or canceling the routes entirely. The decision could impact flight plans for the upcoming travel season, which are typically arranged months in advance.</p>

This move is part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to create a "sovereign" internet, replacing Western platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if they win the next Senedd election. The policy aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by keeping newly qualified educators in Wales, with a focus on Welsh-medium teaching and high-demand subjects like math and science. The payments would be contingent on the teachers working in Wales for five years after their probation. The party stated the proposal is designed to make Wales competitive with incentives offered in England and would be funded from money already earmarked for curriculum support.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of assassinating UnitedHealthcare's CEO, have filed a motion to dismiss key federal charges against him, including the only count that carries a potential death penalty. They argue that the charge of using a firearm during a crime of violence is invalid because the underlying offense, stalking, is not a crime of violence. The defense also seeks to suppress statements Mangione made to police and evidence found in his backpack, claiming he was not read his rights and the search was warrantless. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson in Manhattan last December.</p>

Camilla also noted that the Vesper Martini, James Bond's drink of choice, was a favorite of the much-missed author.
