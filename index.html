          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of striking Iran's Fordo nuclear site, believing disabling it is crucial due to the risk of rapid weapons production. While he approved attack plans, a final decision is pending, contingent on potential negotiations with Iran to abandon its nuclear program. White House officials stated Trump will decide within two weeks, considering the possibility of diplomatic talks. The UK Foreign Secretary is actively seeking a diplomatic resolution, while Trump reviews intelligence reports on Iran's bomb-making capabilities, acknowledging that Iran insists it won't negotiate under duress. Optimism hinges on diplomatic efforts succeeding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The principal of Dundee University and two senior members of its governing body have resigned following a critical report into the university's financial collapse. The report highlighted poor financial judgment and weak governance as key factors, leading to a £22 million government bailout. It stated that university leaders failed to identify the worsening crisis and continued overspending. The report also noted that almost £40 million of ringfenced money had been spent elsewhere and that there was a lack of action to address a fall in international student recruitment.</p>

          <p>Social Security is now projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year earlier than previously estimated, potentially leading to a 20% reduction in monthly benefits. The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report attributes this change partly to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act. Lawmakers are urged to take action to strengthen the program by raising revenue or cutting benefits. The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, and changes to the program could significantly impact retirees' financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

Diplomatic efforts appear increasingly challenging as Iran and Israel continue to exchange deadly blows.
