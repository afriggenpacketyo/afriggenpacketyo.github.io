          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady, continuing its patient approach despite public calls from President Donald Trump for a rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's political independence, stating that decisions are based on economic data and not political factors to avoid influencing elections. While acknowledging that tariffs are beginning to raise prices on some goods, the Fed described overall inflation as "somewhat elevated" and remains committed to controlling it, leaving future rate adjustments uncertain.

          <p>Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage freed after being captured on October 7, has publicly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to potentially recognize a Palestinian state. She argued the move risks rewarding terrorism and sends a dangerous message that violence can earn legitimacy, thereby prolonging the conflict rather than promoting peace. Lawyers for other British hostage families echoed these concerns, fearing the policy could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages. The UK government maintains its demands on Hamas have not changed.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the investigation into former President Jair Bolsonaro's alleged coup plot. U.S. officials accused the judge of suppressing free expression and conducting a "politicized witch hunt" against U.S. and Brazilian citizens. Concurrently, President Donald Trump signed an executive order raising tariffs on Brazilian imports to 50%, escalating economic pressure amid tensions over the prosecution of his political ally, Bolsonaro.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 50% universal tariff on all copper imports, set to take effect immediately, marking the latest move in its protectionist trade policy. The announcement triggered a sharp sell-off in the market, with U.S. copper prices falling by as much as 18% in after-hours trading, potentially the largest single-day drop since 1989. While the White House aims to bolster domestic industries, experts warn the steep import tax could increase consumer prices for a wide range of products, from electronics to construction materials.

          <h2>German Town Council Orders Demolition of Nearly Completed Mosque</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The town council of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany, has ordered the demolition of a nearly finished mosque, citing a contractual failure by the Islamic association that built it. The association, VIKZ, was granted a building permit in 2014 but failed to complete construction within the contractually obligated four-year period. After a legal battle that went to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, the town revoked the permit and has now mandated the structure be torn down, though it has offered to help find an alternative site.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that seven more people, including children, have died from malnutrition in the last 24 hours, bringing the total of such deaths to 154. This comes as UN-backed experts warn that a famine scenario is actively unfolding across the Palestinian territory, with aid deliveries remaining critically insufficient. In a related incident, several Palestinians were reportedly killed near an aid distribution point, highlighting the daily dangers faced by those seeking food amid the ongoing conflict and blockade.</p>

          <p>Despite significant costs from tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and vehicles, major automakers have so far avoided passing these expenses on to consumers. Data shows new car price increases have remained below average, as companies absorb billions in tariff-related losses to maintain market share and avoid deterring already-strained buyers. However, industry analysts predict this cannot last, and consumers should expect to see higher sticker prices and reduced incentives when the 2026 model year vehicles arrive in the coming months.

          <p>Recent immigration enforcement sweeps in California are already having a measurable negative impact on the state's economy, according to researchers and business leaders. An analysis of census data revealed a significant drop in the number of people reporting to work, a downturn comparable to the COVID-19 lockdown period, as undocumented workers and others stayed home in fear. Economists warn that prolonged disruption to this crucial labor force could hobble key industries like agriculture and construction, leading to project delays and potential food price increases.</p>

          <p>Workers at the Savannah River Site, a former nuclear bomb production facility in South Carolina, discovered a radioactive wasp nest during routine monitoring. The nest, found near tanks storing liquid nuclear waste, had radiation levels ten times higher than federal regulations permit and was promptly removed and disposed of as radioactive waste. Officials stated there is no leak from the tanks and believe the wasps were contaminated by legacy radioactive material at the site, assuring the public there is no danger.</p>

          <p>Amid record-high credit card balances, this article outlines the criteria for qualifying for credit card debt forgiveness programs, which can potentially reduce a borrower's debt by 30% to 50%. The most likely candidates are those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, and those with significant amounts of unsecured debt, typically over $7,500. Borrowers who have already fallen behind on payments often have more leverage in negotiations, as creditors prefer recovering a partial amount over a total loss from bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>A recent submersible expedition in the deep-sea trenches of the northwest Pacific Ocean has discovered extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at depths over 31,000 feet. These creatures are thriving in an extreme environment with crushing pressure and no sunlight, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life. Scientists believe these animals survive by feeding on or living symbiotically with microbes that create food through chemical reactions, a process known as chemosynthesis, which may be more widespread in the deep ocean than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his vision for artificial intelligence, framing it as a tool for "personal superintelligence" and individual empowerment rather than a force for centralized automation. This philosophical stance was outlined in a letter to investors ahead of the company's earnings report, following a multi-billion dollar spending spree to hire top AI talent and establish a new research lab. The heavy investment in AI echoes Meta's costly long-term bet on the metaverse, and Wall Street is watching closely for the strategy's direction.</p>
