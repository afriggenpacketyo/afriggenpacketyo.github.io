The conditions included leadership reforms, halting DEI policies, and disciplining students involved in pro-Palestinian protests.

            <p>Shares of LVMH experienced a sharp decline following a reported drop in first-quarter sales, leading to Hermès surpassing it as the world's most valuable luxury firm. The decline in LVMH's sales was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China for cognac, as well as a slide in the key fashion and leather goods division. This shift highlights the challenges facing the luxury sector amid trade tensions and economic uncertainty. Analysts suggest that a positive catalyst for LVMH and the broader sector may require a macroeconomic surprise, as fundamentals are expected to remain difficult in the short term.

The U.S. currently lacks the capacity to replace China's supply of heavy rare earths processing, posing a threat to military capabilities.

            <p>The Chinese government has instructed domestic airlines to cease accepting deliveries of Boeing jets, escalating the trade war between the U.S. and China. This order also includes halting the purchase of airline parts and components from U.S. companies. The move follows China's increase in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the tariffs imposed by President Trump. Boeing is scheduled to ship approximately 10 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, but some deliveries may be affected by the new restrictions.</p>

            <p>An international conference is underway in London, co-chaired by the UK, EU, and African Union, to find a pathway to peace in Sudan. The UK is pledging an additional £120 million in food and medical assistance to address the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The conference aims to unite international partners around a common position to deliver aid and end hostilities, but neither of Sudan's main warring parties have been invited. The war has displaced over 12 million people and resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.</p>

            <p>President Xi Jinping's concept of "profound changes unseen in a century" is gaining traction amid Donald Trump's turbulent return to power. Chinese experts and policy analysts suggest that Trump's policies are accelerating a global reordering where American influence wanes and new powers rise. Xi's call to "drive the changes together" with Vladimir Putin signals Beijing's strategic alignment with Moscow against Washington. The chaotic nature of Trump's administration is lending weight to this vision of a changing world order.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policy aims to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, address national security concerns, boost exports, and raise revenue. However, experts warn that tariffs bring significant costs and downsides, making it difficult to achieve these goals. The tariffs could make imports more expensive, reduce spending, and chill investment in the U.S. Furthermore, Trump's erratic implementation undermines businesses' attempts to plan, creating uncertainty and economic damage.
