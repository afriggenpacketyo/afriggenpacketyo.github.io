        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mhairi Black, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, has officially left the party. Sources indicate her departure stems from significant disagreements with the party's direction, particularly its stances on transgender rights and the conflict in Palestine. Black, who gained prominence as the UK's youngest MP since 1832 when elected at age 20, stated she had long been at odds with numerous strategic decisions. While she remains a staunch supporter of Scottish independence, she feels the party needs to adopt a more left-wing and principled approach on key social issues.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting public pressure from President Trump for a substantial cut to stimulate the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has attributed the central bank's cautious stance to the inflationary risks created by the administration's tariff agenda. While markets do not foresee an immediate rate reduction, there is speculation about a potential cut later in the year. However, economists caution that a lower federal funds rate does not automatically guarantee reduced borrowing costs for consumers on products like mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experienced powerboat racer Brett Duncan, 51, has died from injuries sustained in a crash during an international competition at Oulton Broad, Suffolk. The incident occurred when Duncan's boat collided with a stationary houseboat during a race on Thursday evening. The Circuit Powerboat Association (CPA) confirmed his death, paying tribute to him as a popular and respected member of the powerboating community. No other competitors were involved in the accident, and the UK's Marine Accident Investigation Bureau has launched an inquiry to determine the circumstances surrounding the fatal collision.</p>

          <p>Finland's Lapland region, home to the city of Rovaniemi, is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave with temperatures consistently reaching around 30°C (86°F), about 10°C above the seasonal average. This extended period of extreme heat, the longest since 1972, is impacting local life, tourism, and wildlife, with reindeer seeking refuge from heat and insects. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such events to climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The situation has prompted serious concern about the long-term ecological stability of the region.</p>

          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell engaged in a tense public dispute over the costs of the central bank's building renovations. Trump claimed the project was significantly over budget, a charge Powell immediately refuted by explaining the president's figures included a separate, older building. The confrontation is part of a broader pattern of Trump applying pressure on the Fed, particularly his repeated calls for lower interest rates. This incident further highlights the strained relationship and the president's efforts to challenge the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Tennessee state attorneys are appealing a judge's order requiring them to transport death row inmate Byron Black to a hospital to deactivate his heart implant on the morning of his execution. The state argues the trip would create significant security risks and cause "chaos," proposing the procedure be done the day before instead. Black's lawyers contend that deactivating the cardioverter-defibrillator is necessary to prevent it from repeatedly shocking him during the lethal injection process. They insist it must be done just before the execution to avoid any risk should a last-minute reprieve be granted.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to officially recognize a Palestinian state, a move amplified by France's recent commitment to do so. A parliamentary foreign affairs committee report, supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, argued that statehood is an "inalienable right" and should not be conditional on a long-term peace deal. However, the government's current position, shared by Conservative MPs, is that recognition should be part of a broader two-state solution. This debate places Starmer in a delicate position as he navigates domestic political demands and international diplomatic complexities.</p>

Factors contributing to this trend include improved travel logistics for away teams, such as charter flights and circadian science-based scheduling, which mitigate the effects of vast travel distances. Additionally, enhanced refereeing with VAR and more sophisticated away-game tactics have helped level the playing field.</p>

They contend that many experiments demonstrating AI deception are contrived scenarios where the AI is explicitly prompted to behave maliciously, revealing a capability but not an inherent propensity to do so.

          <h2>Commentary: Trump's Culture War Grievances Serve a Deeper Political Purpose</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent focus on cultural grievances, such as demanding Coca-Cola use cane sugar or that sports teams revert to controversial former names, serves as more than just a distraction. These actions tap into a powerful sense of nostalgia and identity among many Americans who feel their traditions are being eroded by modern changes. By championing these seemingly trivial issues, Trump reinforces an emotional bond with his supporters, making them feel seen and defended. This connection, the author contends, enables him to launch more significant political attacks and maintain his base's loyalty, even when making dangerous accusations.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old registered sex offender, Calese Carron Crowder, has been arrested in Burbank, California, for alleged lewd conduct. Police, responding to a loitering report at a Nordstrom Rack, used surveillance footage from a nearby Walmart to observe the suspect following a female customer and inappropriately sniffing her buttocks. Crowder has a history of similar arrests in the area, with past incidents including peeping and other lewd acts that gained notoriety on social media. The Burbank city attorney's office has filed one count of loitering with intent to commit a crime against him.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed the discovery of human remains in Altadena, California, six months after the destructive Eaton fire, bringing the blaze's death toll to 19. The remains were found in the rubble of a home belonging to 74-year-old Juan Francisco Espinoza, who lived alone and had been missing since the fire. The discovery has renewed criticism over delayed evacuation orders in his neighborhood, which received alerts nearly 12 hours after the fire started.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago explored human reactions to robots with distinct personalities, finding that people generally preferred interacting with an extroverted robot. However, the experiment also revealed that participants found a robot programmed with a neurotic personality to be more human-like and relatable. While the extroverted bot was seen as more enjoyable, the neurotic one, which spoke tentatively and expressed worries, was perceived as having a deeper understanding of emotions. This research suggests that personality traits beyond simple extroversion could play a crucial role in developing more effective and relatable human-robot interactions in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are increasingly linking climate change to a higher frequency of sinkholes around the world, from Brazil to Turkey. Research indicates that intensified extreme weather patterns are a major cause, as periods of drought lower the water table and weaken subterranean support, followed by heavy rains that add sudden weight and cause the ground to collapse. Human activities like excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture, especially in drought-stricken areas, further exacerbate the risk. Experts are using technologies like satellite sensing and ground-penetrating radar to detect underground voids and mitigate the danger before a catastrophic collapse occurs.</p>

The new law, effective next year, changes how gambling losses are deducted, making them only 90% deductible. This means a player who breaks even for the year could still face a significant tax bill on 10% of their winnings, a change that disproportionately affects high-stakes players with large swings. Prominent players and tax experts argue the rule is illogical, as it effectively taxes people who lose money, potentially making professional gambling unsustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

They argue the current warning, which lists risks of cancer and dementia, is not supported by science for these localized treatments and unnecessarily scares women away from beneficial medication. The debate reflects a broader shift in the medical consensus on hormone replacement therapy, which fell out of favor two decades ago due to overstated risks. While advocates celebrate the renewed attention, some experts criticize the process as lacking scientific rigor.</p>
