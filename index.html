          <p>A Russian attack on a civilian bus in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region resulted in the deaths of at least eight people and injuries to five others, according to Ukrainian officials. Ihor Tkachenko, head of Sumy's military administration, reported the incident on Telegram and said medics and rescuers were dispatched to the scene. The strike occurred shortly after rare direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey, which marked the first negotiations between the two countries since the early weeks of Russia's invasion. This attack underscores the ongoing violence despite diplomatic efforts. </p>
