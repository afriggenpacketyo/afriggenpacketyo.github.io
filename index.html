          <p>Brazilian police thwarted a planned bomb attack at Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, where over two million people gathered. The suspects, identifying as Lady Gaga fans, aimed to gain notoriety on social media by spreading hate speech against children, adolescents, and the LGBTQ+ community. The alleged mastermind was arrested for illegal firearm possession, and a teenager was detained for storing child pornography. Authorities seized electronic devices and materials across multiple states, revealing online groups encouraging violence among teenagers through coded language and extremist symbolism. The concert, intended to revitalize Rio's economy, had a massive security operation with 5,000 officers, metal detectors, drones, and facial recognition cameras.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer money to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students in accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Supporters, including President Trump, celebrated the move as a victory for parental freedom, while Democrats criticized it for potentially harming public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier families already in private education. Critics argue that the legislation is not about choice but rather welfare for the wealthy, diverting resources from an already underfunded public school system.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is on track to become an official city named Starbase, following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. The move aims to support the growth of Starbase as a community, streamlining operations and managing local infrastructure, with SpaceX already managing roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for residents. Critics express concerns over Musk's increased control, including potential beach closures for launches, while SpaceX seeks federal permission to increase launch frequency from five to 25 annually. A proposed bill would make non-compliance with evacuation orders a misdemeanor, sparking protests from environmental justice groups concerned about beach access and environmental impact.</p>

          <p>The expiration of a tariff exemption, known as the de minimis loophole, is set to increase the cost of cheaper goods from China for U.S. consumers. Retailers like Shein and Temu, which previously shipped low-value parcels worth up to $800 to the U.S. duty-free, will likely raise prices. Temu has already shifted to a model with locally based sellers fulfilling orders from within the country. Experts anticipate administrative challenges and potential delays in shipments as U.S. Customs and Border Protection faces the task of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. Companies selling goods made in the U.S. may benefit from reduced competition as prices of Chinese goods rise.</p>

          <p>An NFL analyst suggests that Shedeur Sanders' draft slide, despite initial projections as a top pick, was due to how he and his camp handled the draft process. The analyst highlighted Sanders' decision not to participate in the NFL Scouting Combine or the East-West Shrine Game, which he had accepted an invite to, as a mistake. The analyst believed that Sanders was overrated as a player, and the NFL will humble anyone regardless of their perceived status. Sanders was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft and will compete for a starting job.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his plans to step down, marking the end of an era for the value investing icon. Buffett transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate through his disciplined approach of buying wonderful businesses at fair prices. His success has inspired generations of financiers and cemented his status as an avatar of American capitalism, with Berkshire's annual meeting drawing tens of thousands of admirers.

Netanyahu and President Trump condemned Iran for the Houthi aggression, while Israel's defense minister suggested a harsh response.

          <p>California's ambitious high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008 with promises of connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco, faces significant delays and tripled costs, raising doubts about America's ability to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. The project's scope has been reduced to a 171-mile stretch between Bakersfield and Merced, with completion uncertain. Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser, representing landowners affected by the rail line, argues that property acquisition is not the primary cause of delays, but rather poor planning and bureaucratic hurdles. The project has disrupted farmland and local communities, leaving many skeptical about its future.</p>

          <p>PBS CEO Paula Kerger stated that the situation is unprecedented after President Trump issued an executive order aimed at cutting federal funding to PBS and NPR. Kerger noted that this is different because the administration is targeting PBS in multiple ways, including a possible rescission of already appropriated funds and challenging corporate sponsorships. She emphasized that PBS gets 15% of its funding from the federal government, with some stations in small communities receiving up to 50%, making the potential loss existential. NPR CEO Katherine Maher also appeared on "Face the Nation" and said they are looking at options to challenge the order, highlighting the potential devastation for local stations, especially in rural communities.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his refusal to endorse false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Pence defied Trump by declining to overturn electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during the Congressional session on January 6, 2021, which was targeted by rioters. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power. Since leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party.</p>

PBS chief executive Paula Kerger stated that Republican-led threats have been around for decades but are different this time, as they face multiple avenues of attack. NPR chief executive Katherine Maher warned that the impact on local radio stations would be immediate, especially in news deserts where many Americans rely on public broadcasting for local news.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's expansion of executive power is rooted in a tradition of right-wing thought favoring monarchical rule, influenced by figures like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. These thinkers critique liberalism's aversion to decisive action, advocating for a strong executive to make critical decisions for the nation. Scholars affiliated with the Claremont Institute and legal scholar Adrian Vermeule further this view, arguing for consolidating executive power and limiting the influence of administrative bodies. This perspective poses a threat to the separation of powers and risks transforming the presidency into a dictatorial office.</p>

The incident has shaken the community, with both the Hinton family and the officer's colleagues expressing grief and condolences. The police stated that the shooting of the son was justified because the teen pointed a gun in the officer's direction.</p>
