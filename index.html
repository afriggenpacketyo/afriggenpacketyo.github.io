          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, suggests that Joe Biden showed signs of cognitive decline well before leaving office, raising questions about his fitness to serve as president. The authors claim that some individuals behind the scenes questioned Biden's capacity to fulfill his presidential duties, describing a stark contrast between a 'fine Joe Biden' and a 'nonfunctioning Biden.' This account has sparked debate about when these alleged cognitive issues became a significant concern and whether they were adequately addressed during his time in office.</p>

          <p>On, a Swiss sportswear brand, is emerging as a strong competitor to established giants like Nike and Adidas, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter. Analysts attribute On's success to its innovative shoe designs and strategic timing, capitalizing on Nike's sales decline and Adidas's challenges with the Kanye West partnership. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market, On's rapid growth has outpaced both companies in recent quarters, though On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and possible tariffs due to its manufacturing in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still grappling with police reform. Police Chief Brian O'Hara is focused on internal changes to improve safety and community relations, acknowledging that Floyd's death remains an "open wound." Despite shootings trending down, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by an officer shortage. O'Hara is working to restore pride in the profession, adjust arrest tactics, and enhance community engagement and officer training. The Justice Department is ending investigations and canceling consent decrees, but O'Hara insists reform efforts will continue.</p>

          <p>Whitehall is preparing for an upcoming Spending Review, described by insiders as "ugly" due to the prioritization of health and defense spending. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces tough decisions as she balances increasing overall government spending with necessary cuts in other areas. While long-term capital spending will likely see investment, day-to-day spending on public services such as police and education will face significant pressure. This review will set the political landscape for years, shaping the government's priorities and potentially impacting various public services.</p>

Factors contributing to the decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors, the return of social services, and government initiatives to stem violence.
