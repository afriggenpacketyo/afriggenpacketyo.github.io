          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers due to concerns over the telehealth company's sales and marketing of compounded versions of Wegovy. Hims & Hers shares plummeted 34% following the announcement, while Novo Nordisk's stock also declined. Novo Nordisk claims Hims & Hers violated regulations prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization and engaged in deceptive marketing practices. Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum disputes these claims, stating Novo Nordisk pressured them to prioritize Wegovy prescriptions regardless of patient needs.

          <p>President Trump has publicly called on "everyone" to keep oil prices down, warning that high prices would play "into the hands of the enemy" amidst escalating conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. Trump's message, posted on Truth Social, comes as concerns rise that Iran might target energy supplies, potentially causing a global oil price spike. He also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. Crude oil prices closed lower on Monday after Iran's missile attack on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no casualties, with investors hoping for de-escalation.

          <p>President Trump's recent strike against Iran is facing bipartisan pushback on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers questioning the constitutionality of the military action. Several resolutions are being considered that challenge Trump's authority to strike Tehran without congressional approval, citing the 1973 War Powers Resolution. House Speaker Mike Johnson defends Trump's actions, stating the president acted to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expresses skepticism about the justification for the strike. The administration defends the strike as legally justified, with officials citing notification requirements and existing military authorizations. This article summarizes the bipartisan debate over presidential war powers in the context of the recent strike on Iran. The situation has created tension between the executive and legislative branches of the government.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer's shares fell approximately 10% after announcing plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030. The stock decline is attributed to potential dilution of existing shareholders' stakes upon conversion of the notes to equity. The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, and will repurchase $200 million of its stock from the note issuers. Despite the recent drop, Super Micro shares have increased nearly 40% this year due to high demand for Nvidia's AI processors and a major contract with a data center in Saudi Arabia. This article covers the financial implications of Super Micro's debt offering and its market performance amidst the AI boom (not investment advice).</p>

By the start of 2027, a common standard for electronic submissions will be established, with at least 80% of electronic approvals answered in real-time.

          <p>Tech stocks, once considered a safe haven during market volatility, are experiencing a shift, with Apple no longer acting as the equities market's closest thing to a bond. While tech has rebounded strongly from the early 2025 tariff-triggered selloff, Apple has underperformed, raising questions about the sector's traditional role. Investors are now playing tech through broader market bets, with significant weighting to tech in S&P 500 index funds and ETFs.
