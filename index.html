          <p>A shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building on Park Avenue has left four people dead, including an off-duty NYPD officer working as a security guard. The suspect, who was wearing body armor and carrying a high-powered rifle, was later found deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The building houses the headquarters for Blackstone and the NFL, though no specific motive has been established. An employee who was present during the attack described the terror of barricading in a conference room after hearing rapid gunfire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management has issued new guidance affirming the rights of federal employees to express their religious beliefs at work. The memo states that workers can discuss their faith and even politely attempt to persuade colleagues of their views, provided they stop if asked. This policy allows for displaying religious items and inviting coworkers to religious services, framing it as protecting First Amendment rights. The move has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who argue it unconstitutionally encourages proselytizing and could lead to workplace harassment.</p>

Analysts project this could reduce the EU's annual GDP, though the deal does remove the uncertainty of President Trump's previous threat of a 30% tariff.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that the stock market's muted reaction to President Trump's recent trade deal with the European Union is due to "tariff ennui" and a greater focus on other major economic events. He argues that investors are currently more preoccupied with this week's upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates, and forthcoming employment data. According to Cramer, Wall Street has grown accustomed to Trump's negotiation patterns and will not be moved by trade news unless the underlying fundamentals of the market shift.

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Scrutinizes Constitutionality of ICE's "Roving Patrol" Tactics in California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 19:29:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel appears likely to uphold a lower court's injunction blocking aggressive U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tactics in Southern California. The case challenges the constitutionality of "roving patrols" and sweeps where agents allegedly detain individuals based on race or location without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department argues the injunction is a "judicial usurpation" of federal authority, while civil rights groups contend the practices violate the 4th Amendment. The judges intensely questioned the administration's lawyer, signaling a potential Supreme Court showdown over the scope of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been convicted of witness tampering, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal court. A Bogotá judge found that Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, bribed jailed ex-paramilitaries to prevent them from testifying about his alleged ties to illegal right-wing groups. The highly politicized case, dating back to 2012, gained momentum under the current administration of President Gustavo Petro, Uribe's political rival. Uribe faces up to 12 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A garment factory in Lesotho that has produced Trump-branded golf shirts is on the brink of closure following the imposition of heavy U.S. tariffs. The southern African nation was hit with a 50% tariff, threatening its textile industry, which is the country's largest private-sector employer and a key beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). Workers at Precious Garments now face reduced hours and potential job losses, contributing to a "state of disaster" declared by the government. The situation highlights the severe economic impact of U.S. trade policy on the small nation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: President Trump's Reliance on Television News Shapes His Worldview and Policy Decisions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's primary source of information is television, which profoundly shapes his policy decisions and makes him susceptible to manipulation. His recent comments on starvation in Gaza, based on what he saw on TV rather than intelligence briefings, serve as a key example. This reliance on media, particularly Fox News, allows him to connect with the public's perspective but also narrows his understanding and opens him to influence from those who can get their message on air. The article suggests this is especially dangerous in an era of deepfakes and misinformation.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to bolster their outfield defense, with Minnesota Twins center fielder Harrison Bader emerging as a potential target. Despite a star-studded lineup, the team's defense has been a weakness, and an upgrade could be crucial for a deep playoff run keyed by their strong pitching staff. Bader, a premium defender also having a solid offensive season, could provide a significant improvement. The article suggests that preventing runs may be a higher priority for the Dodgers than adding another bat before the deadline.</p>

          <p>The 2016 lawsuit Hulk Hogan won against Gawker Media left a lasting legacy on the intersection of press freedom, celebrity, and digital privacy, according to legal experts. While the case didn't set new legal precedent, it served as a cultural touchstone, demonstrating the limits of First Amendment protections when publishing explicit, private material. The verdict, which led to Gawker's bankruptcy, reinforced the idea that even if a topic is newsworthy, graphic depictions can constitute an invasion of privacy. It also helped establish clearer expectations for both media outlets and individuals regarding privacy rights in the internet age.</p>
