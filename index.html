        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is fueled by a contentious debate over healthcare funding for immigrants and Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. Republicans accuse Democrats of seeking free healthcare for undocumented immigrants, a claim Democrats deny, stating their proposal would only restore Medicaid eligibility for legally present noncitizens as per pre-2025 rules. Democrats are also pushing to extend ACA tax credits, which help millions lower health insurance costs, a key sticking point for their support in funding the government. This article clarifies the differing positions and the legal context surrounding Medicaid eligibility for various immigrant groups.</p>

          <p>Renault is reportedly in discussions with Chinese automaker Chery to produce cars in South America, specifically in Colombia and Argentina. The potential deal would grant Chery access to Renault's existing factory network, with Chery providing capital and product design. Plans include manufacturing combustion-engine cars at Renault's Envigado plant in Colombia, mostly rebadged as Renault, and investing in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line at Renault's Córdoba factory in Argentina. This article highlights that while talks began under a former CEO, the current stance is for Chery to fully fund these projects, indicating a strategic shift for both companies in the region.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's net worth has reportedly tripled since her election, leading to accusations from Republican rival Jack Ciattarelli about her finances. While Sherrill denies trading individual stocks, financial disclosures indicate her wealth growth is largely attributed to her banker husband's over $2 million annual income and a portfolio of properties. The article details her net worth ranging from $9.4 million to $14.61 million, including homes in Montclair, Vermont, and Washington D.C. Despite a past STOCK Act violation for late disclosure of her husband's trades, her campaign asserts her transparency and counters with allegations about Ciattarelli's own wealth sources.</p>

The group allegedly trespassed in the landmark area and tried to affix a banner to one of the 'O's' around noon on a Sunday. Authorities detained the individuals without incident, though the specific message or content of the green-and-white pill capsule banner was not fully visible in shared photographs. This article notes that city park rangers have taken over the investigation, with further details regarding the group's intentions yet to be released by officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced cuts of nearly $8 billion in funding for energy projects in 16 Democratic-leaning states, labeling it "Green New Scam funding." Russell Vought, White House budget director, stated the projects were terminated after a review deemed them economically unviable and not advancing national energy needs. Critics, including California Senator Adam Schiff, condemned the move as political retaliation, arguing it weaponizes policy for revenge and will increase energy prices. This article highlights that the cuts, impacting states like California and New York, coincided with the first day of the U.S. government shutdown, further intensifying political tensions.</p>

          <p>China's three most economically significant cities have implemented policies to address a renewed weakness in the property sector, aiming to stabilize the industry and boost consumer sentiment. Analysts suggest that while these efforts might lead to short-term rebounds in limited regions, a quick market recovery is not expected for the broader slump. The property sector's decline significantly impacts consumption and remains a primary reason for the economy's rough patch. This article notes that government stimulus has mitigated some effects, but persistent household deleveraging and trade tensions continue to pose risks of prolonged stagnation.</p>

          <p>Choosing the right cooking oil can be overwhelming, but experts emphasize that not all fats behave the same way, impacting cholesterol and heart health. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge debunks common myths, advocating for sunflower and vegetable oils due to their low saturated fat and high healthier unsaturated fat content, making them good for everyday cooking. This article clarifies that modern margarines are also healthy alternatives to butter, containing negligible trans fats. It also advises that extra virgin olive oil, with its low smoke point, is best for dressings, while vegetable or sunflower oils are superior for deep frying due to their higher heat tolerance.</p>

Odegaard's recent performance in a Champions League win over Olympiacos, where he contributed to both goals, underscored his crucial role. This article notes that Arteta has granted the 26-year-old Norwegian midfielder "total freedom" to explore and take risks, especially after a shoulder injury disrupted his season. Odegaard's return has already proven vital, with his passing and attacking drive influencing recent comeback victories, demonstrating his natural ability to generate unique plays and spaces on the field.</p>

          <p>Hackers who attempted to extort a nursery chain by posting stolen images and data of children on the darknet have removed the posts and claim to have deleted the information. The criminals, calling themselves Radiant, began posting profiles of around 8,000 children and contacting parents directly to demand a Bitcoin ransom. This article highlights that public revulsion at the attack appears to have forced the hackers to backtrack, stating they are "sorry for hurting kids" and have deleted all child data. Kido Schools reportedly did not pay the ransom, and past cases suggest hackers may not always fully delete stolen data.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that mass layoffs of U.S. federal workers are imminent, potentially within two days, as the government shutdown continues with no resolution in sight. Vice-President JD Vance and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for the impasse, accusing them of playing political games. This article details that Democrats are demanding guarantees on healthcare funding, while Republicans prioritize a temporary spending measure without such conditions. The shutdown, the first in nearly seven years, raises fears of widespread job losses for roughly 750,000 federal employees and significant economic costs, with both parties trading blame for the standoff.</p>
