          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an agreement allowing the Qatari Emiri Air Force to establish a training facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. This initiative will facilitate joint F-15 training with U.S. forces, enhancing combined lethality and interoperability. Hegseth clarified that Qatar would not own a base, but rather maintain a presence for training, underscoring the Trump administration's strengthening ties with Qatar. This partnership also follows an executive order assuring Qatar's security and acknowledges Qatar's substantial role in the Israel-Hamas peace deal.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca has agreed to lower prescription drug costs for Medicaid under a deal with the Trump administration, avoiding potential tariffs. The agreement mandates most-favored-nation pricing for Medicaid and new drugs, matching the lowest prices in other developed nations. This follows a similar deal with Pfizer and builds on a May executive order, aiming to reduce drug prices for Americans. Additionally, AstraZeneca plans a $4.5 billion investment in a new Virginia manufacturing plant as part of a larger $50 billion U.S. investment by 2030, which could create thousands of jobs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods, effective November 1, in retaliation for China's expanded export controls on rare earths. These new tariffs are in addition to existing 30% duties, bringing the total to 130% on Chinese imports. Trump also plans export controls on "any and all critical software," accusing China of an "extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade." This escalation threatens to reignite a trade war, with Trump also suggesting a potential cancellation of his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>The article explores the psychological appeal of the hit BBC show "The Traitors," where contestants engage in lying and deception. Experts suggest the show resonates because it mirrors everyday life, where people try to discern truth from falsehood among friends and colleagues. The celebrity edition adds intrigue, as viewers project pre-existing beliefs onto stars, making their betrayals more captivating. The show exposes the "illusion of co-operation," demonstrating how loyalty can collapse under pressure and self-interest can surface.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, effective November 1, and export controls on critical software, in response to China's "aggressive position on trade" regarding rare-earth minerals.

Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff led negotiations, presenting a 20-point peace plan that combined a cessation of fighting with a vision for postwar Gaza. Trump's "bellicosity" and concern for civilian suffering reportedly pushed both sides, making dissent costly.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, just four days after Lecornu resigned, signaling a deepening political crisis. Lecornu faces the immense challenge of forming a government and passing next year's budget by Monday, despite Macron lacking a parliamentary majority. His reappointment, which came as a surprise, has been met with criticism from opposition parties, who see it as a "bad joke" and a sign of Macron's isolation. This article highlights the ongoing political instability in France and the struggle to address public debt.</p>

          <p>Post-Tropical Cyclone Priscilla, though dissipating, continues to pose a "significant threat" of flash flooding across the southwestern U.S. through the weekend.

          <p>Tech giants like Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla collectively lost $770 billion in market capitalization on Friday, as President Donald Trump's threats of increased tariffs on Chinese goods caused a sharp market downturn. The Nasdaq plummeted 3.6% and the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, marking their worst day since April. Trump's post-market announcement of a 100% tariff on China and export controls on "critical software" further impacted these stocks.

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled against the Trump administration, blocking its attempts to impose conditions on domestic violence grants. These conditions would have prevented recipient groups from promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or providing sexual assault resources. The ruling, which applies broadly to HUD and HHS grants, found that the conditions would cause "irreparable harm" to victims of homelessness and domestic violence. This article highlights a legal victory for advocates who argued the conditions violated the First Amendment and would compromise essential services.</p>
