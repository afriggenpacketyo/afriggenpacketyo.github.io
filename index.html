          <p>Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran, anticipating missile and drone attacks in retaliation, resulting in air raid sirens sounding in Tel Aviv. According to a U.S. official, the United States was not involved in the strike, which occurred as nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iranian officials were planned for the weekend. Prior to the strike, President Trump affirmed commitment to diplomatic resolution while Iranian President Pezeshkian vowed to continue uranium enrichment. U.S. Defense Secretary Hegseth acknowledged that both countries would prioritize their own interests and that the U.S. remains committed to peace. </p>

          <p>During a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles, Democratic Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed after attempting to ask questions. Noem was discussing immigration operations when Padilla interrupted, leading to his removal from the room. Padilla stated he was waiting for a scheduled briefing and sought information on DHS's immigration actions, alleging he was forced to the ground and handcuffed but not detained. Lawmakers, including Gov. Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, condemned the incident, with Bass criticizing Noem's depiction of L.A. and questioning the failure to recognize a sitting senator.</p>

          <p>Thrifting is becoming increasingly popular among Americans, particularly young adults, as a way to save money and reduce textile waste. The secondhand market is expected to more than double by 2028, growing 6.4 times faster than the broader retail sector, driven by concerns over rising clothing prices and environmental impact. Small businesses are capitalizing on this trend, offering sewing classes and curated thrift store experiences. Beyond cost savings, thrifting is viewed as a treasure hunt and a way to create a unique style while supporting mission-driven organizations. </p>

          <p>In Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, his ex-girlfriend, identified as "Jane," concluded her six-day testimony, detailing allegations of coercion and sexual assault. The defense played audio recordings of Combs suggesting she end their relationship, aiming to undermine her claims of a coercive dynamic. Jane testified that Combs pressured her to participate in drug-fueled orgies, threatening to withhold rent payments or release a tape of her having sex; Combs' attorneys argued that the relationship was complex and even loving. The trial is nearing its end, with prosecutors planning to rest their case soon, while another former girlfriend, Chelsea Lovelace, refiled a civil lawsuit against Combs, alleging drugging, forced abortion, and sexual assault. </p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, serving as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. The focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can maintain its seats, given his Cabinet's approval ratings are near a critical level. Parties are actively utilizing social media to attract voters, particularly those unaffiliated, while a new party established by Shinji Ishimaru, a former gubernatorial candidate, seeks to make an impact. Major issues include support for households facing rising costs, political funding scandals, and regional concerns like child-rearing and heat対策.</p>

However, future expansion plans are heavily focused on the Middle East and Africa, followed by the U.S. and Europe, as companies seek to mitigate the impact of tariffs that could potentially rise significantly.

The order aims to centralize efforts currently divided among multiple agencies, proposing a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department. Critics, including former officials, argue this restructuring could increase the risk of catastrophic fires during peak season.

This move is seen as undermining scientific consensus on vaccination, eroding trust in immunization, and potentially impacting access to vaccines nationwide.

          <p>Rory McIlroy, after a strong start, faltered during the first round of the US Open at Oakmont, finishing with a 4-over par 74. JJ Spaun, however, delivered a bogey-free round of 66 to take the lead. McIlroy's struggles highlighted the challenging conditions of Oakmont, where several top players also faced difficulties. Spaun credited his improved confidence to his performance at the Players Championship, where he lost to McIlroy in a playoff, but gained valuable experience competing on a big stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against federal immigration sweeps, overriding the objections of California Governor Gavin Newsom. This move has sparked concerns about the politicization of the military, with critics arguing that Trump is escalating tensions for political reasons. Newsom has described Trump's intervention as a "brazen abuse of power," while the Trump administration maintains that the military presence is necessary to restore order and protect ICE officers. Local leaders and politicians have condemned the deployment, citing it as an unnecessary and inflammatory action.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that President Trump's proposed 'megabill' would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while reducing resources for the poorest Americans. The analysis projects that the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households would experience a 3.9% income cut, while the top 10% would see gains of approximately $12,000 per year. The administration is also defending the deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles, while preparations are underway for a military parade in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Shinjiro Koizumi, Japan's farm minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is gaining renewed attention for his efforts to lower rice prices amid rising household costs. This move is seen as a revival of his political prospects after a setback in the LDP leadership race. Koizumi's actions, including releasing government rice stockpiles at reduced prices, are reminiscent of his father's reformist approach and media-savvy tactics. His renewed popularity could make him a key figure for the LDP in the upcoming national election, as he tackles entrenched agricultural distribution networks.</p>
