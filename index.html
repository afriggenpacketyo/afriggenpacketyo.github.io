          <p>Boeing and the Justice Department are nearing a deal that would allow the aerospace giant to avoid pleading guilty or facing trial in a criminal case related to the two deadly 737 Max crashes. This potential agreement comes after a judge rejected an earlier plea deal, citing concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion. The fraud charge stems from Boeing's development of the 737 Max, with accusations that the company misled regulators about the flight-control system implicated in the crashes. If approved, this deal would resolve the criminal case without requiring Boeing to admit guilt.</p>

An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured people by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While some Republicans argue the cuts aim to eliminate fraud without affecting necessary coverage, individuals like Rosa Andresen and Jodie Montplaisir fear the impact on their access to healthcare and recovery programs, especially with potential work requirements.</p>

          <p>The World Bank cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt after payments by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making the country eligible again for grants to fund reconstruction and economic recovery. This move, along with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, signals growing confidence in Syria's new government after years of civil war. The government has also signed an $800 million deal with DP World to develop the port of Tartus, indicating increasing international investment. However, significant challenges remain for the fractured nation, including infrastructure damage and sectarian violence.</p>
