          <p>Liverpool, despite significant summer signings, is struggling this season, losing three consecutive matches, with analysis pointing to Trent Alexander-Arnold's transfer to Real Madrid as a major factor. The article highlights his crucial role in bypassing high presses, his weak-foot passing ability, and long-range switches of play, which are now lacking. Manager Arne Slot has adapted by using midfielder Florian Wirtz deeper, but this compromises Wirtz's attacking strengths, indicating a tactical challenge for the team.</p>

          <p>Major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, are attributing recent job cuts to AI integration, sparking skepticism from critics who suggest AI is a convenient scapegoat for other business challenges. Experts like Fabian Stephany from Oxford Internet Institute argue that firms may be concealing reasons such as overhiring during the pandemic or broader economic slowdowns. Despite these claims, recent reports from Yale University and the New York Fed indicate that AI has not yet caused widespread job losses, with many companies using it for retraining or hiring.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the US will repatriate two survivors from Ecuador and Colombia after a US strike on what he termed a "drug-carrying submarine," which he claimed was laden with fentanyl and other narcotics.

          <p>Andrew Lownie, Prince Andrew's biographer, claims Buckingham Palace's decision to have the Prince cease using his royal titles is merely "window dressing," arguing the King should have acted more decisively. Lownie suggests the palace failed to grasp the issue's magnitude, implying the move was for PR rather than true accountability, and that Andrew still denies allegations and retains his lifestyle. He also believes more damaging information about Andrew's ties to Jeffrey Epstein is yet to emerge, indicating the current actions are insufficient.</p>

          <p>A psychologist and sexologist explain that a natural decline in sexual desire often occurs in long-term relationships after one to two years, influenced by a shift in hormones from passion-inducing to bonding-focused. Communication about sexual needs is crucial, as is understanding the differences in male and female arousal, with women often experiencing a disconnect between physical and psychological responses due to societal factors. The article emphasizes that consistent affection and making time for intimacy, even when not initially aroused, can strengthen bonds and maintain satisfaction.</p>

          <p>A new Emerson College poll indicates a tight hypothetical 2028 presidential election race, with Vice President JD Vance holding 46% support against California Governor Gavin Newsom's 45%, with 10% undecided. The poll, conducted among 1,000 registered voters, suggests a polarized electorate and little change since August. Both Vance and Newsom are considered likely frontrunners as President Trump cannot seek a third term, with the poll also showing a close generic congressional ballot for the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>The US State Department has issued a warning about "credible reports" indicating an "imminent" Hamas attack on civilians in Gaza, which would violate the ongoing ceasefire agreement. This warning comes amidst the first phase of the ceasefire, which has seen the release of living hostages and the return of some bodies, along with Israel freeing Palestinian prisoners. The article also mentions a recent incident where 11 members of a Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, and previously authenticated videos of public executions by Hamas gunmen.</p>

          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, is generating optimism in China's efforts to reduce its dependence on Dutch giant ASML for advanced chipmaking machines. As a spin-off from state-owned SMEE, AMIES aims to commercialize equipment more rapidly, focusing on breaking the bottleneck in advanced lithography where China still lags due to US export controls. While SMEE excels in back-end processes, AMIES represents a strategic move to catch up in front-end wafer fabrication, crucial for the nation's semiconductor ambitions.</p>

McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris crashed out together in the sprint, an incident McLaren attributed to other drivers, while Verstappen gained crucial points. Despite McLaren's earlier season form, their performance has dipped, and Verstappen's relentless pursuit makes a "brutal" title climax, as predicted by McLaren boss Zak Brown, increasingly likely.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, stating he was "horribly mistreated" and would be released immediately. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, was serving an 87-month sentence and ordered to pay restitution, which he will now no longer have to pay. His attorney thanked Trump for "seeing the human side," while critics like Congressman Nick LaLota argued Santos' crimes warranted a longer sentence.</p>
