          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris attended the 2025 Met Gala, marking her first appearance at the event, shortly after delivering her first major speech since the 2024 presidential election defeat. Harris emphasized the intertwining nature of art and politics, noting art's power to capture the mood and language of the people. She wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by IB Kamara, aligning with the Gala's theme, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style." Harris is reportedly considering a potential run for governor in California in 2026 or a third presidential bid in 2028, based on conversations she has been having. Optimism for her future political prospects remains uncertain, but her presence at the Met Gala signals a continued engagement with public life.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to a combination of air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and runway construction. The FAA has issued ground delays and stops, with arriving flights delayed up to six hours. The Philadelphia TRACON, which oversees Newark's airspace, is facing staffing shortages, and controllers experienced a temporary loss of radar and communications, leading to trauma leave. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day, and lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the FAA's handling of the situation, with Secretary Duffy planning to release a plan to revamp the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Michael Rogers, the FDA's top official overseeing drug and food safety inspections, has resigned after more than three decades with the agency, reportedly due to frustration with the FDA's new commissioner.

The resignation follows sweeping cuts to the inspections office and disagreements over plans to expand foreign surprise inspections while struggling with staffing shortages. Concerns have been raised about the impact of these changes on morale and the ability to maintain oversight quality.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. The problems are attributed to air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Schumer pointed to nationwide shortages, budget cuts, and outdated technology as contributing factors. United Airlines is cutting flights, and lawmakers are calling for solutions to address the issues and prevent future disruptions, with Transportation Secretary Duffy expected to release a plan to revamp the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has begun terminating grants to arts organizations following President Trump's proposed budget, which calls for the agency's closure. The NEA, a major funder of arts and arts education, has distributed approximately $200 million in grants in 2024. Affected organizations are receiving notifications of either full withdrawal of funding or the ability to draw down funds until May 31. The NEA is updating its grant policies to focus on projects that align with the President's priorities, such as supporting HBCUs, celebrating American independence, and fostering AI competency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to reduce the IRS workforce has led to a significant loss of tax auditors, with 31% leaving the agency in the first three months of 2025, according to a report. These cuts, driven by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), may impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, as auditors handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers and corporations. The cuts raise concerns about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given the IRS's role in collecting the nation's revenue. The report also notes the potential for reduced tax compliance and a decline in audits due to the workforce reductions.</p>
