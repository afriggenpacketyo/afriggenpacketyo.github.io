          <p>In Vladivostok, a Russian city over 4,000 miles from the front lines, the impacts of the war in Ukraine are deeply felt through personal loss and societal change. The article profiles a local para-hockey player who lost his leg fighting in Ukraine, highlighting the human cost of the conflict even in Russia's far east. Fresh graves of soldiers mark the local cemetery, serving as a constant reminder of the ongoing war. While some residents express a desire for peace and a return to normalcy, others voice strong support for President Putin and a new global order, reflecting a divided public sentiment.</p>

          <p>A growing number of parents in the United Kingdom are raising alarms about the lack of adequate healthcare services for children suffering from chronic constipation, a condition that led to over 44,000 hospital admissions for those under 16 last year. The article highlights cases where children experienced severe pain and weight loss, with one mother stating her son's condition was not taken seriously until he reached a crisis point. Experts and charities argue that a disparity in dedicated bladder and bowel services across the country is failing children, turning a treatable community issue into a source of emergency hospital visits and significant family distress.</p>

          <p>Four former hotel workers in Milwaukee have received sentences of probation and time served for their roles in the 2024 death of D'Vontaye Mitchell, meaning none will face additional incarceration. The workers were accused of killing Mitchell by piling on top of him for nearly nine minutes after an incident in the hotel lobby, a case that drew comparisons to the murder of George Floyd. A medical examiner ruled Mitchell's death a homicide caused by suffocation and the toxic effects of drugs. The sentences conclude a case that attorneys for Mitchell's family highlighted as a need for greater accountability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 270,000 Venezuelan migrants who were covered under a 2021 designation. This move revokes their legal status and work permits, with officials urging them to self-deport from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program incentivizes illegal immigration and undermines border security efforts.

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that Americans continue to hold negative views of the U.S. economy, with most describing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling." Economic ratings have slightly decreased over the past month, driven primarily by concerns over rising prices, which two-thirds of respondents say are still increasing and expect to continue rising. While personal financial ratings vary by income, a majority of Americans believe the overall economy is worsening, and about a quarter still anticipate a recession. The survey highlights a persistent sense of financial unease among the public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Enterprise software company Salesforce saw its stock fall by 4% in extended trading after releasing disappointing revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter. Although the company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed analyst expectations, the weak forecast added to investor concerns about its stalled growth, which has remained in the single digits since mid-2024. The company's stock has underperformed its tech peers this year, lagging despite its investments in artificial intelligence. Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but the modest guidance suggests continued headwinds in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China showcased a range of new nuclear-capable missiles during a military parade, signaling a significant advancement in its strategic deterrence capabilities. Among the weapons displayed for the first time was the JL-1, a long-range air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM), which effectively completes China's nuclear triad of land, sea, and air delivery systems. Also featured was the JL-3, a third-generation submarine-launched ballistic missile with a reported range of over 10,000 km, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. The parade highlights Beijing's growing military power and its efforts to modernize its nuclear arsenal.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have charged six people with terrorism offenses for allegedly encouraging support for Palestine Action, a group proscribed under UK terrorism laws. The charges stem from an investigation into public gatherings and online meetings held in London, Manchester, and Cardiff over the summer in support of the group. The arrests were made in London, Cumbria, and South Yorkshire ahead of another planned demonstration. Palestine Action was banned in July after its members caused millions of pounds in damage to military aircraft; membership or support for the group can now lead to up to 14 years in prison.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, showcasing advanced weaponry, sent a clear message of its growing global power, an event President Trump acknowledged as "very, very impressive." This display of strength coincides with shifting geopolitical alignments, as leaders from China, Russia, and India appear to be strengthening ties in response to Trump's "America First" tariff policies. The article suggests that Trump's protectionist approach, intended to bolster American industry, may be creating new international blocs that challenge U.S. influence. Furthermore, these trade actions face legal challenges at home, creating a scenario of high risk with uncertain rewards.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Mexican officials have pledged to enhance cooperation on security issues like drug smuggling and illegal migration, even as President Trump defended a recent military strike on an alleged cartel boat. During a visit to Mexico City, Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the strike, which killed 11 people, stating that such actions may continue as a way to stop drug trafficking. The unilateral action has raised concerns in Mexico about potential U.S. military operations on its own territory, a point of tension in the otherwise cooperative relationship between the two administrations.</p>

A key point of contention is the Democratic demand to reverse Medicaid cuts included in President Trump's major policy package in exchange for their votes on a stopgap funding measure. The White House's recent plan to claw back foreign aid funding has further complicated negotiations, threatening to throw the entire process into chaos. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The projected cost for expanding the Los Angeles Convention Center has risen again, now reaching $2.7 billion, an increase of $483 million in just six months. City officials are increasingly concerned about the project's financial viability, especially since it relies on uncertain revenue from proposed digital billboards that may not receive state approval. Without that income, the city's general fund would need to contribute an average of $111 million annually for decades to cover the debt. The rising costs and potential revenue shortfalls have led some city council members to question whether Los Angeles can afford the project.</p>

President Trump announced the strike on a vessel he claimed was operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel. However, specialists in maritime and international law told BBC Verify that using lethal force in international waters outside of an armed conflict could be considered an extrajudicial killing and a violation of the right to life.

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General has announced that four police officers who fatally shot Victor Perez, a 17-year-old autistic and nonverbal boy, will not face criminal charges. The April incident occurred after Perez was seen holding a knife in his family's yard; officers opened fire within 12 seconds of arriving. The attorney general's office concluded the officers were justified, stating they believed others were in danger and did not know Perez's age or disabilities. The family's attorney expressed deep disappointment, arguing that the officers had a duty to de-escalate and retreat rather than use deadly force.</p>
