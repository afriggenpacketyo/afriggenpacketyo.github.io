          <p>A major wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning through Los Padres National Forest in central California, having already scorched over 65,000 acres. The blaze, which is only 3% contained, threatens more than 450 structures and has prompted evacuation orders for nearby residents. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames amid forecasts of hotter, drier weather and erratic winds, which are expected to fuel further growth. Several injuries have been reported, including a hospitalized resident and two contract employees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Texas Democrats leaving the state to block a redistricting bill, this article examines the history and effectiveness of "quorum-breaking." This political maneuver, used by minority parties to halt legislative action, has been employed in various states like Oregon, Indiana, and Minnesota with mixed results. While it successfully draws national attention to contentious issues, experts note it often serves as a delay tactic rather than a permanent block, as governors can repeatedly call special sessions. The tactic highlights increasing partisan polarization in state and national politics.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has granted CEO Elon Musk an interim award of company shares valued at approximately $29 billion, aimed at incentivizing him to remain with the company for at least two more years. This "good faith" payment is intended to honor a 2018 compensation package worth over $50 billion that was previously voided by a Delaware court. The new award is conditional and will be forfeited if the original 2018 package is reinstated upon appeal. The move comes as Tesla faces declining sales and increased competition.</p>

          <p>Texas Senator John Cornyn is introducing the LETITIA Act, new legislation aimed at cracking down on corruption by public officials. The bill proposes stricter federal penalties for officials who commit bank, tax, or mortgage fraud, using their positions for personal financial gain. The act is pointedly named after New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is reportedly under a Justice Department investigation for alleged mortgage fraud. This legislative push follows several high-profile cases involving allegations of financial misconduct against prominent political figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is launching a pilot program that could require some foreign nationals to post a bond of up to $15,000 to obtain a business or tourism visa. The 12-month program targets travelers from countries with high rates of visa overstays, aiming to enforce immigration laws and encourage foreign governments to improve vetting processes. The specific countries have not yet been named, but the measure is a response to a presidential executive order focused on stemming illegal immigration.

          <p>British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was arrested at Luton Airport upon his return to the UK. The arrest is in connection with an assault at St Pancras railway station in London on July 28. British Transport Police confirmed a 42-year-old man was taken into custody on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. The victim sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Video footage on social media showed Robinson near a motionless man on the station floor following the incident.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. jobs report for July revealed a surprisingly low addition of only 73,000 nonfarm payrolls, accompanied by significant downward revisions for the previous two months. This data confirms that the American economic engine is slowing considerably, raising questions about a potential recession. Economists point to this weakening labor market, along with pressures from tariffs on consumer spending and business investment, as key areas of concern. While GDP grew in the second quarter, the underlying metrics suggest a gloomier outlook for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 23% on Monday, giving back a significant portion of the gains from its successful market debut last week. The company's stock had more than tripled on its first day of trading, reflecting strong investor appetite for high-growth, profitable tech companies. Despite the drop, the company's fully diluted valuation remains around $56 billion. The initial public offering came after a planned acquisition by Adobe was called off in late 2023 due to regulatory opposition in Europe.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called for police forces to publicly release the immigration status of individuals after they have been charged with a crime. His comments came in response to a case in Warwickshire involving the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, where the two men charged are reported to be Afghan nationals. Farage argued that a lack of official information fuels online speculation and conspiracy theories, referencing the aftermath of last year's deadly attack in Southport. Current national policing guidance does not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status.</p>

          <p>Two bakery owners in Paterson, New Jersey, were stabbed and slashed by a customer who was allegedly angry about receiving the wrong sandwich four years prior. The assailant reportedly complained that an eggplant sandwich he was given in the past had made him ill. When the owners, brothers Abed and Mohammed Assad, tried to de-escalate the situation, the man pulled a knife, stabbing one in the chest and slashing the other on the arm. The victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and police are currently searching for the unidentified suspect.</p>

          <p>Shares of Berkshire Hathaway fell 3% after the conglomerate reported a 4% year-over-year decline in second-quarter operating earnings, dragged down by its insurance underwriting business. The company also surprised investors by taking a $3.8 billion write-down on its underperforming Kraft Heinz stake and continuing its halt on stock buybacks, despite a sizable correction in its share price. Berkshire remained a net seller of stocks for the 11th consecutive quarter, and its cash hoard remains near a record high at $344.1 billion, leaving investors disappointed by the lack of new investment activity.

          <p>Many small and medium-sized business owners across the U.S. are warning that President Trump's new tariffs will force them to raise prices on consumer goods. With tariffs ranging from 10% to 41% on imported products and materials, businesses that previously absorbed costs are now finding it unsustainable as their pre-tariff stockpiles dwindle. Owners say they face the difficult choice of passing costs to consumers, which could depress sales, or absorbing the costs, which threatens their slim profit margins. This situation could lead to decreased hiring, slower innovation, and potential business closures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have finally identified the cause of a mysterious wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. A new study reveals the culprit is not a virus, as previously suspected, but a bacteria called Vibrio pectenicida, which has also been found in shellfish. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star losing about 90% of its population. This discovery provides a crucial breakthrough, potentially allowing scientists to develop strategies to help the critically endangered sea star populations recover.</p>

A comprehensive analysis shows that Northern Virginia and Maricopa County, Arizona, are the primary hot spots, with 329 and 48 data centers respectively. While these projects bring economic activity, they also raise concerns due to their immense consumption of power and water, and the significant tax breaks offered to developers.
