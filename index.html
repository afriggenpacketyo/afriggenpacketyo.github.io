          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Washington, D.C., for a crucial meeting with former U.S. President Donald Trump and several European leaders. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a "lasting" peace with Russia, rejecting temporary truces and ineffective security guarantees of the past. He expressed gratitude for Western support and highlighted recent Ukrainian military successes, asserting that with continued backing, his country can defend its territory. The meeting aims to forge a reliable path to end the war, with Zelenskyy hoping the combined strength of Ukraine, the U.S., and Europe will compel Russia to negotiate in good faith.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has regained Category 4 strength while moving north of the Caribbean. Although not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, forecasters warn of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Eastern Seaboard throughout the week. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, has prompted tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas. Officials are monitoring its path closely, as it is projected to remain a powerful and dangerous major hurricane for several days.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have initiated their annual Ulchi Freedom Shield joint military exercises, involving 21,000 troops in computer simulations and field training. The 11-day drills are described as defensive, aimed at enhancing readiness against potential threats from North Korea. However, Pyongyang has condemned the exercises as a "military confrontation" and has historically responded to such drills with missile tests. The exercises occur as South Korean President Lee Jae-myung prepares for a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, where discussions about defense cost-sharing are anticipated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the killing of Palestinian journalists in Gaza is a deliberate Israeli strategy to eliminate credible witnesses and control the narrative of the conflict. The author highlights the professionalism, eloquence, and dedication of reporters who continue their work despite immense personal loss and direct threats from the Israeli military. It cites a report on an Israeli military unit, the "legitimisation cell," tasked with discrediting journalists by labeling them as militants. The piece concludes that these journalists have been failed by Western media, which often lends undue credibility to unsubstantiated Israeli claims, thereby undermining the truth.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully converted human stem cells into dopamine-producing neurons and transplanted them into mice exhibiting depressive symptoms. The research, published in *Cell Stem Cell*, showed that the grafted cells helped reduce behaviors like anxiety and resignation while increasing the mice's capacity for pleasure. This breakthrough provides proof-of-concept for a potential new cell therapy to treat neuropsychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder. The approach aims to directly repair dysfunctional neural circuits in the brain that are responsible for mood regulation and anhedonia.</p>

          <p>Ahead of talks between Ukrainian, U.S., and European leaders, this analysis focuses on the profound human toll of the war, arguing that discussions of "land swaps" overlook the reality for civilians. Reporting from frontline villages, the article describes how entire communities, homes, and a way of life are being systematically eradicated by Russian advances. It emphasizes that for Ukrainians, ceding territory is not a real estate transaction but a permanent loss of their heritage and security. Many believe any ceasefire would be temporary, serving only as a prelude to further Russian aggression, a perspective they fear is not fully understood by all Western leaders.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This marks the first government-led operation of its kind during the conflict, coordinated by the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children, who will be selected by the World Health Organization, will travel with family members and receive care from the NHS. The initiative follows calls from a cross-party group of MPs who urged the government to act swiftly to save children at risk of death due to Gaza's decimated healthcare system.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Pakistan's northwestern Buner district has risen to at least 274, with rescuers continuing to search for missing villagers in the rubble of collapsed homes. Authorities are defending their response amid criticism from residents about the lack of timely evacuation warnings, stating the cloudburst was too sudden to predict its exact location. The National Disaster Management Authority attributes the extreme weather to climate change, noting that monsoon rainfall is 50% higher than last year. The government has stated that it does not currently require foreign assistance to manage the crisis.</p>

          <p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has publicly stated that India's continued purchasing of Russian crude oil is funding Moscow's war in Ukraine and must be stopped. In an opinion piece, Navarro argued that if India wishes to be considered a strategic partner of the United States, it needs to align its actions accordingly. He accused India of acting as a "global clearinghouse" for Russian oil and expressed concern over its strengthening ties with both Russia and China.

          <p>Bolivia's presidential election is headed for a historic runoff after Sunday's vote marked an end to over two decades of dominance by the leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz unexpectedly secured first place but failed to win an outright majority, setting up a second-round contest against right-wing former President Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga. The results reflect widespread public discontent over a severe economic crisis, including soaring inflation and fuel shortages, which fractured the ruling party. Voters have signaled a desire for change, though the outcome suggests caution about a sharp pivot to the far-right.</p>
