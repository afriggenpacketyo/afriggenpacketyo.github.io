            <p>The annual Lyrid meteor shower, known as one of the oldest observed meteor showers, is expected to be visible from Wednesday night through April 25. The meteors are debris from Comet Thatcher, which was first documented in 1861 and won't be visible again until the late 23rd century. The peak viewing time is expected around April 21 and 22, requiring a clear, dark sky away from city lights to observe the shooting stars and fireballs. Coincidentally, the Eta Aquariids shower will also begin on Friday and last through May 28.</p>

            <p>Cody Balmer, the suspect in the arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence, allegedly expressed anger over the Gaza War as his motive. Balmer called 911 after the fire, stating Shapiro should know he won't participate in his plans for the Palestinian people. Shapiro, who is Jewish and supports a two-state solution, faced criticism last year for past remarks on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Balmer has been denied bail and is undergoing a competency evaluation, with his attorneys citing severe mental illness as a contributing factor.</p>

            <p>Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have detected potential biosignatures in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b, specifically dimethyl sulfide or dimethyl disulfide, gases only produced by life on Earth. K2-18b, located 124 light years away in the constellation Leo, orbits a cool dwarf star within the habitable zone. While the detection needs confirmation and alternative non-biological explanations are being explored, this marks a significant step in the search for life beyond our solar system.

The move is part of an executive order to reduce the federal bureaucracy, despite the agency's authorization continuing until 2028.

Hospitals are operating on generators, and officials estimate restoring power could take up to 48 hours. The cause of the shutdown is under investigation, marking the latest in a series of major blackouts in recent years. Residents are expressing frustration and renewing calls to cancel the contract with Luma Energy, the company overseeing power transmission and distribution.</p>

            <p>The first public meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) under the Trump administration proceeded as usual, despite concerns of potential political interference. The committee voted to expand options for meningococcal vaccines and lower the age recommendation for RSV vaccines. The meeting was postponed shortly after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services, raising concerns about possible meddling. The meeting covered a range of vaccines, including mpox, flu, and COVID.</p>

            <p>Growing concern surrounds the economic fallout from President Trump's global tariffs, with warnings of higher inflation and market volatility. Trump's strategy of using tariffs to secure individual trade agreements is running parallel to a deepening confrontation with China. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted the "volatility" on the markets in a "time of high uncertainty." The World Trade Organization also warned that the tariffs threaten to act as a brake on global growth.</p>

            <p>The trade battle between the United States and China is driving tariff rates to unprecedented levels, accelerating the decoupling of the world's two largest economies. Instead of a single, measurable split, global supply chains are splintering in complex and risky ways. Manufacturers are reportedly exploring off-the-books workarounds to survive, including smuggling and other risky strategies. As tariffs increase, global trade faces increasing uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared autism a rapidly growing "epidemic" and vowed to identify the "environmental toxin" he claims is responsible. He cited the increasing autism incidence in the U.S. and pushed back against the idea that the increases are simply artifacts of better diagnoses. Kennedy has made statements linking autism with vaccines in the past, an idea that has been thoroughly refuted. Some independent experts and advocates say that's not nearly enough time to design and conduct a good-quality study that could produce a reliable answer.</p>
