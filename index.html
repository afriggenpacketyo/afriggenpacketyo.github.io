The author criticizes the tariffs as the dumbest economic policy ever adopted by a US president, causing damage to stock markets, industries, and diplomatic relations.

            <p>China has amended its rules regarding the place of origin for integrated circuits (ICs), a move expected to benefit local semiconductor manufacturers amidst the escalating US-China trade war. The new rule defines the origin of chips based on the location of wafer fabrication, potentially encouraging chip developers to process their products at local foundries. This shift could increase costs for chips from US-based fabs and incentivize companies to establish facilities outside the US. The decision is seen as a response to Trump's tariffs and an effort to bolster China's domestic semiconductor industry.</p>

While the Trump administration believes the US has the workforce and resources to build iPhones domestically, experts cite challenges such as a lack of skilled labor and existing supply chain infrastructure. Past efforts to move production to the US, such as Foxconn's failed Wisconsin plant, have faced significant hurdles.

The tariffs are expected to significantly increase the price of olive oil, making cheaper alternatives like soybean and corn oil more attractive to consumers and restaurants. While there is a growing movement towards seed-oil-free products, the economic realities of tariffs could drive consumers back to these more affordable options.

            <p>Danish shoppers are boycotting American products in response to President Trump's posturing over Greenland and sweeping trade tariffs. Supermarket chains are making it easier to identify European-owned brands, prompting consumers to choose European products over American ones. The trend reflects a wider shift in consumer sentiment, with travelers also increasingly avoiding trips to the U.S. amid trade policies and concerns about visa-holders. Some big U.S. brands are facing backlash, with sales dropping across the region.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. While the Court upheld a lower court order, it also instructed the judge to clarify the order's scope, particularly regarding the term "effectuate." Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, was deported despite a withholding order forbidding his removal. The Justice Department attributed the deportation to an "administrative error" but claimed he was a member of MS-13, which his lawyers deny.</p>

During the campaign, he boasted that accreditation would be his “secret weapon” against colleges and universities the right has long viewed as too progressive. Dismantling the accreditation system would be a powerful tool to further erode the separation between the government’s political ideology and what US students are taught.</p>

            <p>The Mississippi library commission has ordered the deletion of race relations and gender studies databases from state libraries. The decision follows the Trump administration's dismantling of the Institute of Library and Museum Services (IMLS) and concerns about compliance with state laws. The move is part of a broader trend of anti-DEI measures and could lead to further cuts in library resources. Federal funding uncertainty is forcing state library agencies to look to their respective states for funding, and in the 16 states where anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) bills are law, that means complying with whatever that state’s legislature deems necessary.</p>
