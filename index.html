          <h2>Trump Suggests Global Baseline Tariff Could Be Set at 15% to 20%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:43:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump indicated he plans to set a global baseline tariff of 15% to 20% on imports from countries without specific trade agreements with the U.S. This represents a potential increase from the 10% rate he previously announced, a move that could significantly impact smaller nations. The announcement comes as the U.S. finalizes new trade deals with major partners like Japan and the European Union, which include similar 15% tariff rates. This policy aims to compel more countries to negotiate deals directly with the United States before an upcoming deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pro-Ukrainian hacking group named Silent Crow has claimed it conducted a large-scale cyberattack that crippled the IT systems of Aeroflot, Russia's national airline. The disruption forced the cancellation of over 40 flights and caused numerous delays, impacting thousands of civilian travelers. While the hacking group's claims of completely destroying the systems have not been independently verified, Russian authorities confirmed a hacker attack occurred and have opened a criminal investigation. The incident highlights the ongoing digital warfare accompanying the physical conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave is currently impacting more than 185 million people across a vast stretch of the United States, from the Midwest to the East Coast and down to Florida. Heat indices, which factor in humidity, are projected to reach dangerous levels between 105 and 120 degrees in some areas, particularly in the Southeast. The prolonged and extreme temperatures pose a significant health risk, with major cities like St. Louis, Memphis, and Atlanta expecting multiple days of highs in the upper 90s to low 100s. The sweltering conditions are exacerbated in the Northeast by haze from Canadian wildfire smoke.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their equity face a complex decision between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) due to the current financial climate. Experts suggest that home equity loans offer stability with a fixed interest rate, which is appealing during times of market uncertainty. Conversely, HELOCs provide flexibility with a variable rate that could decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, making them suitable for phased expenses. The best choice ultimately depends on an individual's financial needs, risk tolerance, and plans for the borrowed funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" has raised significant questions about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While the network cited financial pressures, noting the show's annual losses, the move is seen by some as a potential bellwether for the industry. Late-night programs are expensive to produce and face declining linear TV ad revenue and viewership, shifting media company priorities toward streaming and live sports. The future of other shows, like "Jimmy Kimmel Live," will be closely watched as the industry continues to navigate this evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>A new economic study indicates that the long-held affordability of America's Sunbelt suburbs may be coming to an end, as housing supply growth in these areas has plummeted since the early 2000s. Researchers found that metros like Phoenix and Atlanta are now building far less housing relative to their booming populations, mirroring trends that previously made coastal cities like Los Angeles prohibitively expensive. The slowdown is particularly pronounced in affluent suburbs, where regulations and resident opposition appear to be closing the "suburban frontier" for new construction. This trend threatens to create a nationwide housing affordability crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

The print was found pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a ceramic model of a building placed in tombs, likely left by the craftsperson who made it between 2055 and 1650 B.C.E. Egyptologists have described the discovery as rare and exciting, offering a direct and personal connection to an individual from the ancient world. The soul house, along with its unique handprint, will be a featured item in an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum focusing on ancient Egyptian craftspeople.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive international study conducted by U.S. and Chinese researchers has raised alarms about the prevalence of superbugs originating from livestock. After analyzing fecal samples from 26 countries, the team identified a vast and diverse collection of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in the animals' microbiomes. The study developed a framework to map global hotspots for these high-risk genes, which can be transferred to humans through common bacteria like E. coli. This research highlights the urgent need for better policies and monitoring to address the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance linked to agriculture.</p>

          <p>Italy is facing a severe demographic crisis, with national statistics agency Istat forecasting a dramatic decline in its workforce. The number of people aged 15-64 is projected to shrink by more than one-fifth, from 37.4 million today to 29.7 million by 2050. During the same period, the share of residents over 65 is expected to rise to nearly 35% of the total population. This trend, driven by a record-low birth rate and an aging populace, is considered a national emergency that poses a significant threat to the country's economic growth and public finances.</p>

Despite claims of unprofitability, the WNBA's value is soaring, evidenced by a new media rights deal worth over $2 billion, rising franchise valuations, and record-breaking viewership and merchandise sales. Players currently receive just over 9% of league revenue, a figure starkly lower than the roughly 50% share seen in men's professional sports leagues.

          <p>A real estate expert with over a decade of experience advises that homebuyers can negotiate many aspects of a purchase beyond the initial price, potentially saving thousands. Strategic negotiations can include asking for seller concessions to cover closing costs, securing funds for a mortgage rate buydown, or requesting that personal property like furniture be included in the sale. Other negotiable items include pre-closing repairs for issues found during inspection, such as a faulty septic system, which could save a buyer up to $50,000. These tactics give buyers more leverage, especially as the number of property listings increases. (not investment advice)</p>

It points to the dismantling of foreign aid programs, the targeting of organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy, and a shift in diplomatic focus away from human rights. The author suggests this change emboldens authoritarians globally, who no longer fear condemnation or consequences for cracking down on dissent.

Cuban says the experience taught him a valuable lesson: it doesn't matter how many times you fail, as you only need to be right once.

This "superhero move" shows competence, empathy, and a willingness to learn, which builds trust and makes a person more likable to colleagues and superiors.
