            <p>Aimee Lou Wood, known for her role in 'The White Lotus,' publicly criticized a recent Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her character, Chelsea, as 'mean and unfunny.' The sketch featured Sarah Sherman wearing exaggerated prosthetic teeth and using a pronounced accent, which Wood felt 'punched down' on her and perpetuated misogynistic stereotypes. Wood clarified that she wasn't targeting Sherman but rather the sketch's concept, emphasizing that while she's open to being made fun of, it should be clever and in good spirits. She also highlighted the irony of the joke focusing on her 'big gap teeth' rather than her work, noting that the conversation surrounding her appearance made her 'a bit sad because I'm not getting to talk about my work'.</p>

            <p>A growing trend of 'coolcations' is seeing baby boomers and first-time travelers increasingly choosing cooler destinations in Northern Europe over traditional Mediterranean hotspots during the peak summer months. Concerns about extreme heat, overcrowding, and high costs are driving this shift, with countries like Iceland, Estonia, and Scandinavia experiencing a surge in bookings. Travel agencies report a significant increase in travel to northern Europe for July and August, while bookings to southern Europe have decreased or shifted to the shoulder seasons. This trend reflects a conscious decision to avoid the intense summer heat and wildfires that are becoming more common in southern Europe, and it presents an economic opportunity for northern European countries.</p>

            <p>Pfizer has halted the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill, danuglipron, after a patient in a trial experienced a liver injury potentially linked to the drug. While the patient recovered rapidly after discontinuing the pill, Pfizer decided to cease development following a comprehensive review of clinical data and regulatory input. This setback adds to Pfizer's challenges in entering the competitive GLP-1 market, dominated by injectable medications from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Despite this, Pfizer remains committed to developing other weight loss drugs, including an oral drug targeting GIPR and another once-daily oral GLP-1 currently in phase one trials.

However, Sony has reduced the cost of its disc drives for digital consoles in the UK.

            <p>New research reveals that paper receipts from major U.S. retailers contain alarmingly high levels of bisphenol S (BPS), a chemical linked to cancer and reproductive problems. The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) has issued violation notices to numerous retailers, asserting that brief contact with these receipts can expose individuals to unsafe levels of BPS. The findings are particularly concerning for cashiers and restaurant workers who handle receipts frequently. The CEH urges companies to switch to safer alternatives or provide warnings to consumers about the toxicity of the receipts.</p>

            <p>Critics are raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest as the Trump administration deregulates the cryptocurrency industry while the Trump family expands its footprint in the sector. The growth of World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm with significant Trump family involvement, coincides with the administration's efforts to ease regulations, leading to accusations of corruption and economic hazards. Economists and senators have voiced concerns about Trump's potential enrichment through crypto ventures and the risks posed by loosening oversight.

            <p>President Trump's volatile trade policies and threats to federal funding are creating significant uncertainty for California's state budget, which relies heavily on income tax from high earners tied to the stock market. The state faces potential revenue losses from tariffs and retaliatory measures, impacting key industries like agriculture and technology. Predicting the economic fallout is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of Trump's policies, requiring the Newsom administration to adopt a conservative approach in developing revenue forecasts. These federal uncertainties exacerbate existing fiscal challenges, including rising healthcare costs and reliance on the state's rainy day fund.</p>

            <p>Southern California is unrepresented on the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), with all five commissioners residing in or near Sacramento or San Francisco. This lack of geographic diversity has raised concerns among Southern Californians, who feel their interests are not adequately considered in decisions affecting their electricity, gas, and telecommunications services. The commission's recent decisions to approve rate increases for utilities, despite protests from Southern Californians, have fueled criticism. A bill has been introduced to require the governor to appoint commissioners from various regions of the state, aiming to ensure broader representation on the powerful regulatory body.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on key allies, are inadvertently handing China a strategic advantage, according to experts. By alienating traditional partners like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, the U.S. is pushing them towards closer economic ties with China. This shift could undermine American power in the region and strengthen China's influence. Furthermore, the trade war jeopardizes U.S. reliance on Taiwanese microchips, a critical component for national security, making it harder for the U.S. to deter potential Chinese aggression.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that Atlantic salmon exposed to anti-anxiety medication in rivers exhibit increased boldness, leading to greater success in reaching their destination during migration. The study, which implanted slow-release drugs in juvenile salmon, found that clobazam, a benzodiazepine, boosted migratory success, possibly due to the fish traversing hydropower dams more quickly. However, this increased risk-taking behavior could have negative long-term consequences for the salmon population, as lab experiments suggest drugged fish are less likely to form schools, making them more vulnerable to predators. The study highlights the potential impact of pharmaceutical contamination on aquatic ecosystems and the need for better wastewater treatment.</p>
