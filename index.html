          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, have dropped the traffic charges that led to the detention of 19-year-old Ximena Arias Cristobal, a Mexican-born student, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Police determined the officer stopped the wrong vehicle, but Arias Cristobal remains in ICE custody facing deportation. Her father, Jose Francisco Arias Tovar, is also detained by ICE. Despite the dismissal of charges, the Department of Homeland Security maintains that both father and daughter are in the country illegally.</p>

          <p>The stock market has rebounded to pre-tariff levels, but investors remain cautious due to uncertainty about the final level of tariffs. Despite a slower pace of inflation, concerns persist about the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer. This uncertainty is causing businesses to hold off on investments and consumers to reduce spending, potentially slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vaccine experts are puzzled by the Trump administration's $500 million project to develop a universal flu vaccine, dubbed Generation Gold Standard. The project aims to create a flu shot that doesn't require annual updates and protects against other respiratory viruses. However, experts are skeptical of the project's use of a whole killed virus approach, which is considered antiquated and may produce more side effects. They also question the large price tag and the lack of independent review in selecting the technology.</p>

          <p>The parents of Edan Alexander, the American-Israeli hostage freed after being held captive by Hamas since October 7, 2023, expressed their relief and gratitude. Edan Alexander was the last living American hostage in Gaza. His parents said they always believed he would be released and are grateful to President Trumpâ€™s team for their efforts.

          <p>The first federal court hearing on President Trump's tariffs on Liberation Day did not go well for the administration. A three-judge panel seemed troubled by the administration's claim that the judiciary may not review the legality of the tariffs. The case is V.O.S. Selections v. Trump. While the judges expressed concern about the broad power Trump claims, they also struggled to articulate a clear rule for determining which presidential actions are "unusual" or "extraordinary."</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a bill to fund President Trumpâ€™s agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts, despite internal divisions. Democrats are challenging the Republican efforts, and protests have erupted over the proposed Medicaid cuts. The bill includes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, stricter eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for non-citizens. Republicans are using a process called reconciliation to fast-track the legislation. Sen. Josh Hawley has voiced concerns about cutting Medicaid.</p>
