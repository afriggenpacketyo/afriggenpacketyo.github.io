          <p>Johnson County Sheriff Adam King, previously arrested by his own deputies, now faces an aggravated perjury charge, adding to existing indictments for sexual harassment and retaliation. King, who pleaded not guilty, is accused of lying to a grand jury and harassing female employees with inappropriate remarks and offers of perks for spending time with him. Despite these serious allegations and a trial date set for 2026, a judge has permitted him to return to work under strict conditions. These include limited office hours and a ban on contacting several witnesses, most of whom are sheriff’s department employees and some of his accusers. This article highlights the ongoing legal challenges and the significant controversy surrounding the sheriff's conduct and his ability to continue in his role.</p>

          <p>The head of UK Space Command, Maj Gen Paul Tedman, has revealed that Russian satellites are regularly stalking British military satellites, alongside weekly jamming attempts using ground-based systems. This hostile activity has intensified significantly since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with both Russia and China also developing and testing anti-satellite weapons. Tedman expressed deep concern over the increasing militarization and congestion in space, noting the UK's heavy reliance on America for its space-based defense. The article highlights the UK's commitment to investing a billion pounds into integrated air and missile defense, including new sensors to detect laser threats in space, to counter these evolving dangers.</p>

          <p>Apple has removed ICEBlock and similar applications from its App Store, which allowed users to anonymously report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. This action followed significant pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi and occurred amidst ongoing controversy surrounding the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement. The decision was primarily prompted by law enforcement concerns about safety risks to agents, particularly after a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility reportedly searched for such apps. The article notes the app's creator viewed it as a way to "fight back" against deportation efforts, highlighting the deep division surrounding immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Munich Airport temporarily suspended operations after multiple drone sightings on Thursday evening, leading to the cancellation of 17 flights and the diversion of 15 others, impacting nearly 3,000 passengers. Authorities were alerted after drones were detected, with police unable to confirm their type, size, or origin due to darkness. This incident follows similar disruptions at other European airports in Denmark and Norway, prompting a recent EU leaders' summit to address the issue of unidentified drone interference. The article underscores growing concerns about aviation security and the challenges posed by unconfirmed drone activity near critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A weak low-pressure system situated between Miami and the Bahamas is bringing significant heavy rainfall and coastal flooding across Florida, prompting a flood watch for Brevard and Volusia counties. Volusia and Flagler counties are also under a coastal flood advisory due to higher high tides and a persistent onshore breeze, conditions exacerbated by recent tropical systems. The City of Ormond Beach reported closures of North Beach Street at Tomoka River due to these elevated tidal levels. Heavy rain is expected to continue through Sunday, particularly for areas east of Interstate 4, impacting travel and local infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study indicates that a rising number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are living paycheck to paycheck, making retirement savings increasingly unattainable. Approximately 42% of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X workers report no spare savings after covering essential expenses, a figure projected to exceed half by 2033 due to escalating housing and healthcare costs. The article highlights a "financial vortex" where basic expenses consume a growing share of income, emphasizing the inadequacy of current retirement planning models. Strategies like early savings and private market investments are suggested as potential aids, though many find these out of reach (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley defense tech startups, dubbed "neoprimes" like Anduril Industries and SpaceX, are attracting billions in funding to challenge traditional defense contractors. These companies are characterized by their speed, lean operations, and software-first approach, addressing critical technology gaps in national security. Venture funding for U.S.-based defense tech startups reached approximately $38 billion in the first half of 2025, driven by a shift towards "great power competition" and the need for dual-use technologies like artificial intelligence and autonomy. This article suggests these innovations aim to create credible deterrence that discourages aggression rather than initiate conflict, reshaping modern warfare.</p>

The study estimates that a typhoon of Ragasa's intensity was approximately 49% more likely compared to pre-industrial times, with about a third (36%) of the damage in South China directly attributable to climate change. Researchers noted that human-induced global warming boosted Ragasa’s winds by 7% and rainfall by 12% at landfall, intensifying its destructive power.

          <p>The FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary, has praised the TrumpRx initiative, a new direct-to-consumer government purchasing platform aimed at making prescription medications more affordable for Americans. Pfizer is the first drug giant to join, agreeing to offer significant discounts, aligning with lower European prices, and reducing costs for Medicaid recipients. Makary views this as a "major step" to address healthcare costs, with some medications seeing savings up to 85%. However, industry experts express skepticism about the program's broad impact on most Americans' out-of-pocket costs, questioning its effectiveness without mandatory participation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A report by Global Witness alleges that TikTok's algorithm recommends pornography and highly sexualized content to children's accounts, even with safety settings activated.

Global Witness informed TikTok, which stated it took immediate action to resolve the problem, but subsequent tests revealed the issue persisted.

COVID-19 can manifest with similar symptoms but may also cause a loss of smell/taste or a "razor-sharp" sore throat, and diarrhea is common.
