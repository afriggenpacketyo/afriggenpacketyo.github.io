          <p>Multiple UK newspapers report on Prince Harry's controversial resignation from Sentebale, a charity he co-founded, citing accusations of damaging fundraising and bullying.  The Guardian also leads with President Trump's threats of tariffs on Russian oil if a Ukraine ceasefire isn't reached within a month. The BBC's neutral reporting style presents both sides, but the focus on Harry's negative actions might reflect a subtly anti-monarchist bias.</p>
