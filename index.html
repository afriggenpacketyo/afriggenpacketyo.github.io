          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating residents' data privacy rights. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company unlawfully tracked and collected user data. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, the settlement resolves allegations related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. The company asserts that policy changes related to these allegations were previously announced or implemented.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, causing further delays and cancellations for travelers. The FAA confirmed a telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark's airspace. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, including new centers and upgraded equipment, but the upgrades could take up to four years. United Airlines has been limiting flights to and from Newark amid the ongoing issues, and officials insist the airspace remains safe despite the delays.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March, stemming from an opinion piece she co-authored about Israel's war with Hamas. The judge emphasized that the op-ed was the only evidence presented against her, and there was no indication of violence or advocacy for violence.

          <p>Former President Trump expressed openness to raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to provide tax breaks for lower-income earners, framing it as "good politics." He dismissed comparisons to George H.W. Bush's broken promise of "no new taxes," arguing that Bush's loss was due to Ross Perot. Trump suggested that a small tax increase for the rich to benefit lower-income workers could be acceptable, despite potential criticism from Democrats. The comments come as Republicans seek ways to extend the 2017 tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a highly contagious liver infection. Cases have been unusually high in 2024 and 2025, with at least 138 people infected in 2024, and levels of the virus in local wastewater suggest the figures are an undercount. Officials say many of the recent cases have occurred in people without typical risk factors, leading to concerns about food contamination and community circulation. At least seven people have died in this outbreak.</p>

          <p>Freddy Escobar, the suspended president of the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City (UFLAC), disputes allegations of financial improprieties, including missing receipts for credit card purchases. He claims he has the documentation to clear his name and that the records were already uploaded into the union's expense system. The International Assn. of Fire Fighters (IAFF) suspended Escobar and other union officers over the financial issues, citing over $800,000 in credit card purchases that were not properly documented. Escobar said the auditors never spoke to him and that any issues were matters of detail.</p>

Earlier this week, Henan province, which grows about a third of China's crop, issued a risk warning as hot, dry weather threatened the wheat growing in its fields.</p>

He expressed concern that DOGE would "gut" the agency and "turn back the clock on product safety." Consumer Reports and several Democratic senators condemned the CPSC firings.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the Tyre Nichols case and the challenges in achieving murder convictions for the officers involved, despite video evidence. The author argues that the broader movement toward police reform has stalled due to changing political winds and rising violent crime. The city of Memphis declined to enter into a consent decree with the Justice Department, and the Trump administration has taken steps to weaken police oversight. The author expresses concern that without accountability, unjust deaths like Nichols' will continue.</p>

          <p>Fifteen states are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to fast-track oil and gas projects, claiming the administration is bypassing environmental protection laws. The states argue that agencies are improperly permitting projects under the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, causing irreparable harm to natural resources. The attorneys general said they believe reliable and affordable electricity is of critical importance to the nation, but energy production is already at an all-time high. The states want a federal judge to declare the executive order unlawful and bar the agencies from pursuing emergency permitting for non-emergency projects.</p>
