          <p>Hefin David, a prominent Welsh Labour politician and Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly since 2016, has died suddenly at the age of 47. Tributes from political leaders, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan, remembered him as a dedicated public servant and a powerful advocate for his community. David was known for his lively contributions to parliamentary debates and his willingness to challenge the party line. Gwent Police have stated that the death is not being treated as suspicious, and the Senedd's presiding officer expressed devastation on behalf of the entire Welsh Parliament.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, the U.S. Department of Justice has proposed forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser. In response, AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer of $34.5 billion to acquire Chrome, aiming to integrate its AI browser with Chrome's vast user base. The potential sale represents a significant threat to Google's core advertising business, which relies heavily on the data collected through the browser. This development marks a major moment for U.S. antitrust enforcement, echoing historic cases against monopolies like Standard Oil and AT&T. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated there is currently "no sign" that Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing to end the war, urging international partners to maintain pressure on Moscow. His comments come as the White House prepares for a summit in Alaska between President Trump and Putin, which is being framed as a "listening exercise" to gauge Russia's position. Zelenskyy, who is not attending, has been coordinating with European leaders to ensure Ukraine's interests are represented in any potential peace discussions. Meanwhile, long-range drone and missile strikes from both sides have continued across the region.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a new ultimatum for individuals living in homeless encampments in Washington, D.C., giving them the choice to accept services at a shelter or face jail time. This crackdown is part of President Trump's federal takeover of the city's law enforcement, aimed at addressing what he calls an "out of control" crime situation. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that U.S. Park Police have already cleared 70 encampments, with the remaining two scheduled for removal this week. The administration is also reportedly exploring relocating encampments to areas far outside the city, a move that has sparked concern among residents and advocates.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of prehistoric whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, that lived 26 million years ago. The discovery was made after a local man found a well-preserved skull fossil on Victoria's Surf Coast, a region known for significant paleontological finds. This dolphin-sized whale, described as "deceptively cute," was a formidable predator with sharp, slicing teeth, belonging to a group of early whales distantly related to modern baleen whales. The finding provides new insights into whale evolution and highlights the unique prehistoric marine life that once inhabited Australian waters.</p>

          <p>A recent tax and spending law enacted by the Trump administration includes the largest cuts in history to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This reduction in benefits is expected to have a significant negative impact not only on families who rely on the program but also on the grocery stores where they shop. Independent grocers, who have already faced a difficult five years, may be particularly vulnerable to the decreased spending from SNAP recipients. The policy raises concerns about food security for low-income families and the economic viability of local food retailers across the nation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Juneau, Alaska, have issued urgent evacuation warnings as the city braces for potentially record-breaking floods from the Mendenhall Glacier. The flooding is caused by an annual glacial outburst from Suicide Basin, a side basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt and then drains under the glacier. The National Weather Service predicts the Mendenhall River will crest at a new record height, threatening hundreds of homes in the Mendenhall Valley. While temporary barriers have been installed to protect properties, the recurring event highlights the ongoing challenges posed by climate change in the region.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Israel's Killing of Journalists in Gaza Continues with Impunity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel is targeting and killing journalists in Gaza with impunity, citing the recent killing of six media workers, including Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif. The author, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, contends that Israel has a pattern of baselessly accusing journalists of terrorism before targeting them, noting that 184 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the war began. The piece criticizes the muted reaction from the international community and some media organizations, which it claims has emboldened Israel. This lack of accountability, the article suggests, risks closing the world's window into the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Actress Rashida Jones, who earned an Emmy nomination for her role in the "Black Mirror" episode "Common People," discusses the show's cautionary themes about technology and capitalism. In the episode, her character is saved from a coma via a brain subscription service that devolves into a parable about corporate greed and the U.S. healthcare system. Jones reflects on how the series mirrors our current reality, where convenience often comes at the cost of privacy and agency. To escape the pressures of modern life, she emphasizes the importance of disconnecting from technology and reconnecting with nature, or as she puts it, "you gotta touch grass."</p>

          <p>In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have mapped the locations of approximately 8,700 cattle feeding operations in the U.S., revealing that California has more facilities and acreage than any other state. The research, conducted by the University of Michigan and UC Santa Barbara, provides a comprehensive national database where none previously existed. The data shows that these confined animal feeding operations are associated with degraded air quality and lower socioeconomic well-being in nearby communities. This new map and database will enable more targeted research and policymaking related to the environmental and health impacts of industrial agriculture.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's demand for a $1-billion payment from UCLA is fundamentally different from pressures on private universities like Columbia. The author, a UC professor, contends that targeting the University of California is an attack on a public institution funded by California taxpayers and a vital engine for the state's economy. The demand is framed not as a genuine concern for student rights, but as a political pretext to punish opponents and seize state resources. The author calls on Californians across the political spectrum to resist what they describe as a federal overreach and an attempt to "steal" public money.</p>

          <p>This column asserts that the Republican party is pursuing a long-term strategy to dismantle Social Security, the popular government assistance program celebrating its 90th anniversary. The author points to recent actions by the Trump administration, such as staffing cuts and office closures, as attempts to sabotage the program's effectiveness and soften public support for privatization. The piece also highlights comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who referred to a new private savings account program as a "back door for privatizing Social Security."

          <p>A recent analysis by sports betting website Action Network has ranked California as the best state in the U.S. for stargazing, based on factors like sky visibility, elevation, and astronomical infrastructure. While some professional astronomers question the methodology, they agree that California offers excellent opportunities for viewing celestial events due to its large wilderness areas and designated Dark Sky Places. Locations like Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and Joshua Tree National Park provide ideal conditions far from city light pollution.

          <p>As the new school year begins, Los Angeles public schools are implementing unprecedented measures to protect students and their immigrant families from federal immigration enforcement actions. These protections include police patrols creating "safe zones" around campuses, altered bus routes, and community volunteers acting as lookouts to warn of nearby raids. The move comes in response to heightened fear in immigrant communities following the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics. School officials assert they are standing on the right side of the Constitution to protect every child's right to an education, regardless of immigration status.</p>

While the campaign lists a coalition of supporters, it omits Airbnb, which confirmed its involvement but declined to detail its role.

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., has raised concerns among California officials that federal forces could be sent to cities like Los Angeles and Oakland. Trump has suggested such deployments could expand to combat crime, a move legal experts call highly unusual outside of a major crisis. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass labeled the idea a "political stunt," while acknowledging that a federal security presence for the 2028 Olympics is expected but distinct from a domestic law enforcement action. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and state authorities over the use of military forces within U.S. cities.</p>
