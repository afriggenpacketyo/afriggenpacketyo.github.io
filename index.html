          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned from his position. His departure follows a disagreement with the Trump administration over a request to use an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection as a gift for King Charles III. Arrington reportedly resisted giving away the historical artifact, arguing it was the property of the American people, and instead offered to help find a replica. While the White House denies involvement in his exit, sources suggest some administration officials were unhappy with his refusal to provide the authentic sword for the state visit.</p>

          <p>In the New York City mayoral race, candidates Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo have launched their initial television advertisements, using the ongoing federal government shutdown to frame their campaigns. Mamdani's ad focuses on affordability and blames the Trump administration for the shutdown, aligning with progressive figures. Conversely, Cuomo's ad highlights his experience and criticizes the administration for cutting counterterrorism and infrastructure funding to the region. The dueling messages showcase their distinct priorities and political strategies as they seek to appeal to voters just a month before the election.</p>

          <p>Carlos Cruz, who immigrated to the United States from El Salvador in 1979 to escape the impending civil war, has become a successful restaurateur in Baltimore. Starting his career as a dishwasher, Cruz eventually opened three popular establishments: Carlos O'Charlies, Bayside Cantina, and Chilango's. His culinary success has also led him to cater for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team for many years. Cruz attributes his achievements to the support of his family and the core values of respect and honesty instilled by his parents during his upbringing in a small Salvadoran village.</p>

          <p>Police in Morocco report that at least two people have been killed after officers opened fire during youth-led demonstrations near the city of Agadir. The protests, organized by a movement known as GenZ 212, erupted across the country over public anger that the government is funding new stadiums for the 2030 FIFA World Cup instead of investing in essential services like hospitals. The unrest has spread to major cities including Rabat and Casablanca, with hundreds of arrests made and numerous injuries reported among both police and protesters, reflecting widespread discontent over high youth unemployment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy has announced the cancellation of more than $7 billion in funding for 223 projects, stating they are not economically viable or aligned with national energy needs. The move, detailed on the first day of the government shutdown, affects projects in 16 states that all voted for the previous administration. Democratic lawmakers have condemned the decision as political retribution intended to punish their states during the funding dispute. The White House budget director referred to the canceled funds as part of the "Green New Scam," intensifying the partisan conflict over the administration's spending priorities.</p>

          <p>A terrorist attack outside a synagogue in Manchester has left two people dead and four others seriously injured. The incident, which occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, involved an attacker ramming a car into pedestrians and then stabbing multiple people before being shot and killed by police. Authorities reported the suspect was wearing a fake explosive vest and was prevented from entering the synagogue by security staff and worshippers. The attack has been widely condemned by political leaders, and police have increased security at synagogues across the United Kingdom in response to the event.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, announced a new pricing model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders, a move that sent its stock soaring over 20%. This change could potentially disintermediate the three major credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—which have traditionally served as middlemen and whose stocks fell sharply on the news. The new plan offers lenders a choice of pricing models, which Fair Isaac says will eliminate unnecessary mark-ups and give more control to those making mortgage decisions, a development praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director.</p>

Republicans are attempting to persuade moderate Democrats to support their short-term funding bill, but Democrats remain united in their demand that any agreement must address healthcare subsidy extensions.

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, reporting 497,099 units, which slightly exceeded analyst expectations. However, the company's vehicle production for the quarter saw a decline compared to the previous year, and its stock price fell following the report. The delivery figures were released as a significant federal tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired, which may have spurred some sales at the end of the quarter. The results reflect a mixed performance, with a sales slump in Europe being partially offset by stronger demand in the United States.</p>

The current PSR, which limits club losses to £105 million over three years, has been criticized for stifling investment. The proposed SCR system would allow clubs to spend a set percentage of their revenue on squad-related costs, aiming to maintain competitive balance while allowing for strategic growth.</p>

The World Happiness Report measures life satisfaction, and experts suggest Finland's success stems from a strong sense of societal contentment rather than daily expressions of joy. This contentment is fostered by a robust social safety net, funded by high taxes, which provides free access to public resources like extensive libraries and ensures universal opportunities. Additionally, a deep cultural connection to nature and traditions like sauna use contribute significantly to the nation's overall well-being.</p>

Aerobic activities like running are particularly effective at stimulating mood-balancing neurochemicals, while strength training can boost confidence and yoga is beneficial for stress management. The greatest well-being benefits are often seen in sedentary individuals who begin a new routine, with studies showing significant reductions in depressive symptoms after just a few months.

The company faced backlash first for Kimmel's comments about a conservative activist and then for pulling the show, a move seen by critics as caving to political pressure from the Trump administration.

          <p>As the federal government shutdown delays official labor market reports, alternative data indicates a significant slowdown in the U.S. job market. A report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas revealed that planned new hires for 2025 are at their lowest level since 2009, during the financial crisis. While layoff announcements decreased in September, the year-to-date total for planned job cuts is the highest since 2020. This data provides a crucial, albeit partial, view of the economy as economists and Federal Reserve policymakers are forced to rely on private-sector reports in the absence of government statistics like jobless claims and payroll counts.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Purdue University are planning an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe could be the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object was identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro, an island 400 miles from Earhart's intended destination, and has been visible in photos since 1938. This theory suggests Earhart landed on the island after running out of fuel in 1937 and was marooned. The team will use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object, hoping to find definitive proof and potentially return the historic plane to the university.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is projected to have a significant negative impact on the U.S. economy, with one estimate suggesting a cost of $7 billion for each week it continues. This economic damage results from lost pay for federal workers, delays in government purchasing, and an overall decline in consumer demand. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the record 34-day shutdown in 2018-2019 cost the economy about $11 billion. While some economic activity is recovered once the government reopens, costs such as lost user fees and administrative expenses for shutdown and startup procedures result in a permanent loss for taxpayers.</p>

          <p>This article examines the central claims in the government shutdown debate, particularly the Republican assertion that Democrats are seeking to provide taxpayer-funded healthcare to immigrants in the U.S. illegally. In reality, the Democratic proposal aims to restore Medicaid eligibility to pre-2025 rules, which covered various classes of noncitizens with legal status, such as refugees, asylees, and parolees. Federal law has long prohibited most federal benefits for immigrants without legal status. The dispute stems from a bill passed by the Trump administration that significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility, which Democrats are now trying to reverse as part of the funding negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has offered a $20 billion currency swap line to Argentina to help stabilize its economy, but the aid comes with a significant condition: Argentina must cancel its existing $18 billion swap arrangement with China. This move is seen as a direct challenge to Beijing's growing financial influence in Latin America. The currency pact with China has been a crucial lifeline for Argentina, allowing it to manage foreign reserves and settle international debts. Analysts warn that accepting the U.S. offer could leave Argentina vulnerable, potentially trading one form of dependency for another in a high-stakes geopolitical maneuver.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that the death of 23-year-old Paloma Shemirani from non-Hodgkin lymphoma was influenced by her mother, a prominent conspiracy theorist who convinced her to reject chemotherapy. Instead of pursuing conventional treatment, which offered an 80% chance of a cure, Paloma followed her mother's advice to use alternative methods like coffee enemas and juices. The coroner stated that the influence exerted by her mother contributed more than minimally to her death from the progression of a treatable disease. The case highlights the tragic consequences of medical misinformation and the complex family dynamics that led to the fatal decision.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of conspiracy theories surrounding Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, which have persisted for over eight decades and were recently reignited by President Trump's order to declassify related government records. The author argues that tales of espionage and capture by the Japanese were largely fabrications, some even promoted for profit by Earhart's own widower. The historical consensus among aviation experts remains that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, simply ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. The piece urges remembering Earhart for her actual achievements as a pioneering aviator rather than the myths surrounding her tragic, yet likely mundane, death.</p>

This transaction marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash pile. Berkshire is already a major shareholder in Occidental, holding a 28.2% stake. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program.

          <p>This article addresses a common misconception among investors known as "low-price bias," the belief that a stock with a lower share price has more upside potential than one with a higher price. It explains that this view is misguided because a stock's nominal price does not reflect its underlying value, growth prospects, or overall market capitalization. Using a comparison between Nvidia and International Paper, the article demonstrates how focusing on fundamentals like revenue growth and industry trends is a far more effective investment strategy than being influenced by the arbitrary share price.

          <p>With the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs, some financial experts are advising investors to reconsider the popular "set-it-and-forget-it" strategy of exclusively holding S&P 500 index funds. They argue that the index has become heavily concentrated in a few large-cap technology companies, reducing its effectiveness as a diversified investment and increasing volatility risk. To achieve better balance, experts suggest alternatives such as total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or adding international and value funds to a portfolio. This approach aims to protect against long periods of underperformance that can occasionally affect the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>
