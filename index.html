          <p>Following the U.S. imposition of new tariffs, China's Foreign Ministry asserted that "the market has spoken," pointing to the sharp decline in U.S. stock markets as evidence of the tariffs' negative impact. A spokesperson called for the White House to engage in "equal-footed consultation" to resolve the escalating trade war. The announcement came after China's Finance Ministry declared a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the U.S., effective April 10, exacerbating investor fears of inflationary pressures, recessionary risks, and slower global economic growth. China views the trade and tariff war started by the U.S. as unprovoked and unjustified.

          <p>President Trump's 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries, including the UK, has officially taken effect, marking a significant shift in global trade dynamics. The tariffs, which began being collected by U.S. customs agents, are set to increase for goods from larger trading partners, such as the EU and China, in the coming week. International leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have expressed concerns about the potential for an all-out trade war, emphasizing the need for a measured response. The tariffs have already shaken global stock markets, resulting in a substantial decline in market value and prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets.

The author contrasts this policy with the increasing persecution faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in countries like Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine. Referencing Emma Lazarus's poem on the Statue of Liberty, the piece suggests the U.S. is no longer perceived as a welcoming haven for the persecuted. The defection of Russian tennis player Daria Kasatkina to Australia due to her sexual orientation further underscores this point, highlighting a shift in global perceptions of the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authors argue that Los Angeles' Measure ULA, a transfer tax on high-value properties, needs reform to address unintended consequences. The tax, intended to fund low-income housing, has led to a significant drop in high-value property sales, reducing revenue and slowing market-rate apartment production. The design flaws, including steep 'cliffs' and taxation based on sale price rather than profit, incentivize tax avoidance. The authors propose state legislation to restrict the tax to single-family homes, adopt marginal rates, or limit it to properties that haven't been sold or improved in many years, fostering a better balance between revenue generation and economic growth.</p>

          <p>TikTok creators in the United States are experiencing emotional exhaustion and resignation due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the app's future. The initial fear of a ban has evolved into fatigue and a sense of being used as a "political football" amid trade negotiations. Experts attribute this fatigue to broader societal stressors and a lack of control over the app's fate. Some creators are considering alternative career paths, while others express apathy towards the situation.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny after a judge revealed that it "covertly" froze funds allocated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This development coincides with mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These actions are occurring amidst the implementation of President Trump's new tariffs, which his administration has dubbed "Liberation Day," and the firing of the director of the U.S. National Security Agency.</p>

          <p>A woman convicted of breaching an abortion clinic protection zone in Bournemouth, UK, has vowed to continue her "fight for free speech." The case has drawn international attention, with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour expressing concerns about freedom of expression. The woman maintains that she was offering a "consensual conversation" and not protesting or harassing anyone. The judge ruled that her presence could have a detrimental effect on women attending the clinic.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians are grappling with constant fear and sleep disturbances due to ongoing Russian attacks, particularly at night. Many have removed air raid alert apps from their phones in an attempt to find some rest. The war has darkened the country, with streetlights turned off and many people having fled. Psychologist Yuliia Krat emphasizes the importance of accepting the silence and not associating it with impending danger, but says that healing from the trauma of nighttime attacks takes time.</p>

          <p>A discussion on the increasing use of torpedo bats in baseball, bats with a slightly different weight distribution than traditional wooden bats. While they are unambiguously legal, it's debated whether they offer a real advantage or if it's more psychological. Some stats-curious people think there's some very early evidence that they could help some hitters against some pitchers, maybe. The article emphasizes that success in baseball comes from consistent performance over a long season, not just from freak occurrences or equipment innovations.</p>

          <p>A chaotic week of mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has left workers in confusion and uncertainty. Some employees who were initially fired have been temporarily reinstated, while others remain unsure of their job status. The cuts, which targeted both administrative and scientific positions, have disrupted critical programs and raised concerns about the agency's ability to fulfill its mission. The government is not providing precise details about the positions and functions that have been cut. Workers are crowdsourcing lists of those cut.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced HHS would eliminate 10,000 jobs as part of a restructuring plan. Together with cuts already made by Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, HHS is likely to lose 20,000 workers – roughly one-quarter of its workforce. As part of the restructuring, the administration announced 28 divisions would be folded into 15, including the creation of a new division, called the “Administration for a Healthy America”, or “AHA”. Piecemeal and crowd-sourced information, which has filled the vacuum left by a lack of information from the health department, appears to show maternal health programs slated for elimination, many without an indication of whether they will be reassigned.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs on imports from China and other countries could significantly impact Apple's iPhone production and potentially increase consumer prices. The company, which relies heavily on manufacturing in China, may face higher costs due to the tariffs. Shifting production to other countries or back to the United States would be a complex and expensive undertaking. The tariffs are expected to drive up the costs of consumer electronics, including the iPhone, as products become more expensive to produce.

          <p>The Trump administration's slash-and-burn approach to federal programs has delivered a considerable hit to the nation’s environment, but experts say its plans to repeal hard-won protections for clean air and water will also directly jeopardize Americans’ health — and their wallets. The EPA’s plans to repeal or weaken 31 environmental regulations, including a bedrock principle known as the “endangerment finding,” which affirms that carbon dioxide emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare. Rolling back just a dozen key environmental rules will erase $254 billion in annual benefits for public health and environment, compared with only $39 billion in savings.</p>
