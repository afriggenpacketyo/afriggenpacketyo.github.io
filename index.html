          <p>The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, indicated ongoing price pressures in May. The core PCE index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose by 0.2% for the month and 2.7% annually, slightly exceeding economists' expectations. This data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions on interest rates, as policymakers weigh a cautious approach against calls for rate cuts. The report also highlighted signs of a weakening consumer, with both personal spending and income declining unexpectedly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has publicly stated that his team is in discussions with reigning world champion Max Verstappen regarding a potential move for the 2026 season. This revelation resurfaces speculation about Verstappen's future, as his Red Bull contract, which runs until 2028, is believed to contain exit clauses. The potential move is fueled by Red Bull's recent performance dip and key personnel losses, alongside Mercedes' perceived strength heading into the 2026 regulation changes. Russell expressed no personal concern over his own future with the team, trusting in his performance.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has formally announced his bid for reelection, positioning himself as a "blue-collar" candidate with a record of reducing crime and boosting job growth. Running as an independent, Adams contrasted his practical achievements with what he termed the "empty promises" of his primary Democratic rival, Zohran Mamdani. The launch follows a tumultuous first term for Adams, which included a federal investigation that was later dropped. Adams is framing the election as a choice between his experienced leadership and Mamdani's socialist-aligned progressive platform.</p>

          <p>Hungary's government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has concluded a national consultation in which it claims 95% of participants voted against Ukraine's EU accession. This vote followed a months-long, state-sponsored media campaign portraying Ukraine as a "mafia state" and its citizens as criminals. While the results cannot be independently verified, Orban is using them to claim a strong mandate in Brussels.

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin offered a stark critique of her party, describing it as a "solar system with no sun" due to its internal divisions and lack of teamwork. Speaking at the Center for American Progress, she argued the party must refocus on fundamental "pocketbook" issues like jobs, housing, and healthcare affordability to reconnect with voters. Slotkin, who narrowly won her 2024 race in a Trump-leaning state, emphasized that the shrinking middle class is the greatest security threat to the U.S. She called for "wartime generals" to lead the party and unite its factions.</p>

          <p>A severe E. coli outbreak in northern France has led to the death of a 12-year-old girl and the hospitalization of at least 21 other children. Health officials believe the outbreak is linked to contaminated meat, prompting the precautionary closure of six butcher shops in the Saint-Quentin area. Nine of the hospitalized children developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare and serious complication that can cause kidney failure. Investigations are ongoing to pinpoint the exact source of the contamination, as officials urge the public to follow food safety guidelines.</p>

Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, cited safety concerns, a stance that contradicts the global scientific consensus on the life-saving impact of vaccines.

          <h2>Experts Question "Self-Deportation" Trend Amid Anecdotal Reports of Immigrants Leaving the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While stories of immigrants choosing to leave the U.S. under the Trump administration are gaining attention, experts caution against concluding it's a widespread trend. The concept, sometimes called "self-deportation," is seen by some analysts as part of a political strategy to create an illusion of high deportation numbers without the cost of actual enforcement. Many immigrants have deep roots, including jobs and families, making departure a difficult and unlikely choice. A new government program offering a small stipend for "assisted voluntary return" has reportedly seen very limited uptake, suggesting most undocumented residents are not opting to leave.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Zohran Mamdani's expected victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary represents a significant challenge to the Democratic party's establishment. Mamdani, a 33-year-old socialist, defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo by running a disciplined, charismatic campaign focused on affordability and backed by motivated young volunteers. The author suggests this win proves the party's progressive flank is an asset, not a liability, and reflects a base that is tired of the leadership's passivity. Mamdani's success offers a potential new vision for a party that many feel has lost its way.</p>

By the early 2000s, major chains began removing them in favor of more modern solutions.

          <h2>European Union Proposes International Trade Restrictions on All Eel Species</h2>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing global trade restrictions on all 19 species of eel under the CITES international treaty, citing sharp population declines. The proposal, which will be considered later this year, would require export permits for all eel products, including live juvenile eels and processed food. Japan, a major consumer of eels, is strongly opposing the measure, arguing that its own eel populations are recovering and that such regulations could increase poaching. Japan plans to coordinate with China and South Korea to fight the proposed international trade curbs.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The U.S. Military Must Remain Apolitical to Protect National Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, the author argues that politicizing the U.S. military poses a fundamental threat to American democracy and national security. The military's effectiveness and the public's trust depend on its non-partisan role, with service members swearing an oath to the Constitution, not to a president. The author contrasts this with autocratic regimes where the military's primary role is to protect the ruler. Citing the recent deployment of the National Guard in California, the author warns that using troops for partisan reasons weakens the nation and erodes the principles that separate free societies from tyrannies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karen Russell's new novel, "The Antidote," explores the fantasy of erasing painful memories against the historical backdrop of the Dust Bowl. The book is set in a Nebraska town where "prairie witches" can store unwanted memories for their clients, allowing them to forget personal traumas and collective guilt, such as the theft of Native American land. The reviewer notes that the novel complicates traditional Dust Bowl narratives by focusing on this "Invisible Loss." Ultimately, the article argues, the book's project is to show that memories, both good and bad, are essential for individual and societal health and identity.</p>

          <h2>The Debate Over Removing Grizzly Bears from the Endangered Species List Intensifies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contentious debate is raging over whether to remove the grizzly bear from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) list. After being brought back from the brink of extinction, the grizzly population in the Yellowstone area has surpassed all recovery goals, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict as bears expand their territory. Proponents of delisting, including state wildlife agencies, argue that the ESA's purpose is to recover species, not protect them indefinitely, and that success must be recognized. Opponents fear that removing federal protections would expose the bears to new threats like hunting and habitat loss, potentially reversing decades of progress.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Germany have charged a young Syrian national for his alleged role in a foiled terrorist plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Austria, last year. The suspect, identified as Mohammad A., is accused of supporting the Islamic State group and helping prepare a serious act of violence. He allegedly assisted an acquaintance in Austria by translating bomb-making instructions and connecting him with an IS member. The plot was discovered in August 2024, leading to the cancellation of three concerts and the arrest of three other individuals in Austria.</p>
