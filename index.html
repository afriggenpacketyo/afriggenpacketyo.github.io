          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Monday, reacting to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement over the weekend, which came after his national election defeat. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.5% and the Topix reached a record high, reflecting investor excitement around potential successors such as agricultural minister Koizumi Shinjiro and deregulation-focused Takaichi Sanae. However, the Japanese yen weakened and bonds continued to sell off, driven by concerns over persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate an extended period of uncertainty for Japan into Q4 2025, even as the market shows a positive, albeit surprising, initial response to the political shift.</p>

          <p>China's August exports grew by 4.4% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms, falling short of Reuters-polled economists' estimates for a 5.0% rise and marking the lowest level since February. This deceleration reflects a waning of businesses' front-loading activities, which were previously aimed at avoiding higher U.S. tariffs. Concurrently, imports rose by a muted 1.3% last month, missing estimates for 3% growth, as persistent issues like the real estate slump and rising job insecurity continue to suppress domestic demand. Despite an extended tariff truce between Beijing and Washington, this article highlights ongoing challenges in China's trade sector and broader economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was observed pushing a Buffalo Bills fan after a touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins during Sunday night's game. The incident, captured by the NBC broadcast, showed a fan sitting near the field appearing to smack both Hopkins and Jackson on their helmets as the players came close to the barrier. Despite the physical interaction, no penalty was assessed on the play, and Jackson appeared to collect his emotions after returning to the Ravens’ bench. This article underscores the ongoing debate regarding fan behavior at sporting events and the challenges athletes face in maintaining composure amidst such interactions, with the broadcast commentator acknowledging the difficulty of the situation.</p>

The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, and its Quanta X2 robot, designed for advanced cleaning and human-like functionality. While acknowledging that AI for robots still lags behind generative AI advancements, X Square Robot aims for "robotic butlers" within five years and plans for an initial public offering next year.

Lee, a New Zealand citizen who had traveled to South Korea and changed her name, denies the charges and is representing herself. This article highlights the distressing nature of the case, with prosecutors outlining their intent to call 40 witnesses, and the court considering the matter of Lee's sanity at the time of the alleged killings.</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This discovery is significant as most bodies in the solar system have not cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core, challenging previous assumptions about Mars' internal structure. The finding suggests Mars, like Earth and the Moon, has an inner core, a similar proportion to Earth's, which might revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics.

It asserts that many Chinese and mainstream Western economists do not view China as an enemy, and that American voters' choices, such as re-electing Donald Trump, cannot be blamed on external actors.

          <p>Linebacker Nate Landman, a new team captain for the Los Angeles Rams, made a game-sealing play by forcing a fumble from a Texans running back in the final minutes, which was recovered by Braden Fiske. This crucial defensive effort secured a 14-9 season-opening victory for the Rams against the Houston Texans. Landman's "artisan's touch" for punching out the ball was highlighted by coach Sean McVay, who noted his extensive practice in this skill, calling it "competitive greatness." The article also praises the Rams' defense for limiting the Texans to three field goals, complementing an offense that showed grit, with quarterback Matthew Stafford passing for over 60,000 career yards.</p>

While U.S. equities attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020-2024, inflows have slowed this year, with capital now evenly split between U.S. and international markets. Asia is perceived as offering significant stimulus potential, robust competition in the tech space, and more favorable valuations compared to expensive U.S. stocks.

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for over 90,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees, specifically 2022 to 2026 plug-in hybrid electric models, due to a software error that could lead to a "loss of drive power." This defect, identified within the hybrid control processor, poses a significant safety risk as an unexpected loss of propulsion could cause a vehicle crash without prior warning. As of August 18, Chrysler was not aware of any injuries or accidents related to the issue, which is a positive aspect of this safety concern. A remedy is currently being developed, and affected owners will be notified starting October 23, with vehicles searchable by VIN on the NHTSA website from September 11.</p>
