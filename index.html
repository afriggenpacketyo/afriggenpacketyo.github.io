          <p>Hours before his assassination, conservative activist Charlie Kirk made a social media post critiquing a Wall Street Journal article about Kentucky's child custody law, which presumes equal parenting time is best for a child. The article notes that Kirk's post highlighted polling data showing overwhelming bipartisan and cross-demographic support for such shared parenting legislation in key swing states. He argued that political candidates who openly support equal custody laws could gain a significant electoral advantage. This final message is being interpreted as a strategic gift to any political party willing to champion the popular, family-focused issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has enacted an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, citing a need to prevent program abuse. This represents a massive increase from the previous administrative fees, which totaled around $1,500. The move has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers and business groups who argue it will price out small businesses and startups, potentially driving operations outside the U.S. Conversely, supporters of the policy, including the Commerce Secretary, state that it forces companies to prioritize hiring American workers unless a foreign applicant is valuable enough to justify the steep cost.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack has targeted Collins Aerospace, a company providing essential check-in and baggage systems to numerous airlines, causing major disruptions at key European airports. Hubs including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin have been affected, forcing staff to resort to manual processing for passengers and baggage. This has led to extensive queues, flight delays, and some cancellations, impacting thousands of travelers across the continent. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected global aviation industry to digital threats, as authorities work to restore the affected systems as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>A retired grandfather, Ed Langevin, experienced severe heartburn, nausea, and significant weight loss, which were ultimately diagnosed as symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition caused by blocked arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine. After initial tests failed to identify the problem, a stomach scan revealed the condition, which his doctor had only seen once before. He underwent a minimally invasive procedure to place a stent in the affected artery, which immediately resolved his symptoms and allowed him to eat normally again. His story underscores the importance of patient self-advocacy when facing persistent and unusual health issues.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned following pressure from the Trump administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. The resignation comes after a months-long mortgage fraud investigation into James, a political adversary of the president, failed to produce an indictment. Critics express deep concern that the move represents a weaponization of the Justice Department for political retribution, eroding norms that protect prosecutorial independence from White House influence.

          <p>According to new data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the average reading and math scores for American 12th graders in 2024 have fallen to their lowest points in over two decades. The results show a significant decline, with math scores at their lowest since 2005 and reading scores 10 points lower than in 1992. Experts note that this downward trend began before the COVID-19 pandemic, although chronic absenteeism has worsened since. Potential contributing factors cited include increased screen time, declining student engagement, and the rollback of certain educational accountability measures.</p>

          <p>Recent federal budget cuts and the revocation of grants under the Trump administration are leading to widespread layoffs that disproportionately impact Black women, who constitute over 12% of the federal workforce. The public sector has historically been a vital pathway to middle-class stability for this demographic, offering better pay equity and benefits than the private sector. The article highlights the personal and psychological toll on those affected, who describe the experience as traumatic and destabilizing. This trend is forcing many to reconsider their career paths and creating a climate of fear and uncertainty even for those who remain employed.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence boom has fueled an unprecedented surge in the private market, with seven top technology startups, including OpenAI, SpaceX, and Anthropic, reaching a collective valuation of $1.3 trillion. This figure has nearly doubled in the past year, driven primarily by intense investor demand for AI exposure, which now accounts for 77% of all private-market capital raised this year. With such vast sums of private funding available, these companies have little incentive to go public. The immense growth of these private entities is also significantly impacting public markets, boosting stocks of partners and suppliers like Oracle and Broadcom. (not investment advice)</p>

While the event was expected to inject $250 million into the local economy, it also raises complex questions about the impact of such a large influx of visitors. The article explores the tension between the economic benefits of tourism and the potential strain on local resources, culture, and housing markets, particularly in a place already dealing with infrastructure challenges and gentrification. Bad Bunny himself has acknowledged this irony, often addressing these issues within his music.</p>

          <p>Two German states, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, have significantly updated their burial legislation to reflect changing societal wishes. The new laws will permit ashes to be scattered in major rivers like the Rhine, allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, and enable the creation of "memorial diamonds" from cremated remains. These changes, which also include provisions for Muslim shroud burials and green funerals, respond to a cultural shift where cremation is now favored over traditional burial. While proponents celebrate the move toward personalization, critics from Christian churches and conservative parties worry it may undermine the role of traditional cemeteries.</p>

While Trump significantly increased arms sales to Taiwan during his first term, his second term has seen a cooling of support.

          <p>To help consumers avoid overspending on a vehicle, financial planners suggest following the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline for affordability. This framework advises making a down payment of at least 20% of the car's price, financing the vehicle for no more than four years, and ensuring that total monthly transportation costs do not exceed 10% of your income. Adhering to these principles can help lower overall interest payments, prevent becoming "underwater" on a loan, and ensure that a depreciating asset like a car doesn't compromise long-term financial goals such as retirement savings.</p>

He observes that while China's leadership is dominated by engineers focused on physical infrastructure and manufacturing, America's governing class is largely composed of lawyers. Wang argues that while this focus has led to issues like high youth unemployment in China, it has also produced remarkable successes in areas like mass transit and clean technology. He provocatively suggests that it is now time for the U.S. to learn from China's physical dynamism.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. According to the National Hurricane Center, the system is currently moving northwest over open waters and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. However, forecasters predict Gabrielle will gradually intensify, likely strengthening into a hurricane by Sunday. While its current track keeps it north of the Caribbean, the storm could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to build strength over the ocean.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the season, concluding an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hailed as the greatest pitcher of his generation, Kershaw was the cornerstone of the franchise's revival, guiding the team through a tumultuous period of bankruptcy and mediocrity to an era of perennial success. His career includes three Cy Young Awards and a legacy of consistent excellence that places him among the all-time Dodger greats. His departure is seen as the end of an era, but one that leaves the team in a far better position than when he arrived.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Hermosa Beach, California, remodeled his family's 1959 house into a "net-zero energy" home that produces more power than it consumes, reportedly for less than the cost of a traditional remodel. The project involved replacing all gas appliances with electric ones, installing rooftop solar panels, and using passive design principles like strategic roof overhangs for natural heating and cooling. Key lessons from the decade-long experience include the necessity of extensive research, being persistent with contractors to stick to the plan, and adapting to a changing climate. The project demonstrates that sustainable living can be both stylish and economically viable.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, the Trump administration has intensified its rhetoric against "leftwing" non-profit groups, causing immigrant advocacy organizations to brace for a potential crackdown. Top officials like Stephen Miller have vowed to hold these groups "criminally liable" for what they baselessly claim is coordinated violence, and ICE has expanded its definition of threats to include filming their operations. Activists state they are advising staff to be cautious but will not be intimidated into giving up their First Amendment rights to observe and document immigration enforcement actions. They view the threats as part of a broader campaign to create an atmosphere of fear.</p>

          <p>Critics and political analysts are warning that President Trump is using the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk as a pretext for a campaign of vengeance against his political enemies. Over the past week, the administration has escalated threats against the "radical left," considering domestic terrorism designations for some groups and investigating non-profits without any evidence linking them to the killing. Experts on authoritarianism note this is a classic tactic, where a tragic event is harnessed to justify crushing dissent, eroding free speech, and consolidating power. The rhetoric is seen as an attempt to delegitimize the entire Democratic party and opposition civil society.</p>

          <p>The family of Sonam Kshatriya, a 27-year-old woman whose 2019 death was ruled a suicide by hanging, is legally challenging the medical examiner's findings. Their suspicions of foul play were amplified when the funeral director discovered extensive and "troubling" bruising on her body, prompting him to send her back for a full autopsy. Despite this, the manner of death remained unchanged. The family's court petition highlights suspicious evidence, including blood smears on the bathrobe belt used as a ligature, which experts claim suggests a struggle and the presence of a third party. They are appealing to have the case reopened for a proper police investigation.</p>

          <p>A plan to raise the deck of the 60-year-old Vincent Thomas Bridge has created a conflict between the Port of Los Angeles and nearby residents. The Port argues that raising the bridge by 26 feet is necessary to accommodate larger, next-generation cargo ships, thereby securing jobs and maintaining the port's competitiveness. However, this would add $1.5 billion to the cost of an already-planned renovation and extend the bridge's closure from 16 to 28 months. Local communities and businesses are concerned about the severe disruption from rerouted truck traffic and the negative impact on tourism and daily commutes.</p>

While caterpillar consumption is a long-standing tradition in many parts of the vast country, some research suggests its popularity has grown in recent decades due to economic hardship and the scarcity of bushmeat.
