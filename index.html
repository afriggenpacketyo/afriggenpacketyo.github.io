          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the termination of the Women, Peace and Security program, initially signed into law by President Trump in 2017, citing it as a "woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative." Hegseth stated the Defense Department would adhere to the minimum legal requirements but would strive to end the program entirely during the next budget cycle. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen criticized Hegseth's decision, emphasizing data that demonstrates the positive impact of women's involvement in peace negotiations. Kathleen McInnis from the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues the program isn't DEI-related, as it doesn't mandate organizational quotas or goals for academic admissions or career fields within the DOD.

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has suspended Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan after she was federally charged with concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, as well as obstructing a proceeding. The FBI claimed Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from an immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was later arrested. Dugan is accused of escorting Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer from her courtroom through the jury door after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the building seeking his arrest.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, removing some levies on auto imports, steel, and aluminum to alleviate production costs and profit squeezes. Carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff on auto imports will not be subject to other levies, including those on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico. However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and aluminum that their suppliers pay and pass on. The administration will offer automakers an exemption from auto parts tariffs for a portion of the manufacturer's suggested retail price of automobiles assembled in the United States, phased out over two years.

On his 100th day back in office, Trump eased tariffs targeting car manufacturers, offering offset credits to U.S. manufacturers for two years to bolster the domestic supply chain. The administration official noted that, as tariffs took effect, many nations and industry leaders have made good-faith efforts to negotiate terms favorable to the U.S., adding to the tariff changes.

An eight-year-old child in Texas died from measles on April 3, according to health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. Researchers have warned that the country is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter century after the disease was declared eradicated in the country. US pediatricians and infectious disease experts say the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination from government health officials and statements on unproven treatments that are confusing parents.

He does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.
