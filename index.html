          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has affirmed that Hamas leaders will not have immunity anywhere, refusing to rule out future strikes like the recent one in Qatar. Speaking alongside U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu asserted Israel's right to self-defense beyond its borders, even as the Doha attack drew international criticism. The meeting also highlighted ongoing Israeli military plans in Gaza and settlement expansion in the West Bank, despite warnings of a worsening humanitarian crisis from the UN.</p>

          <p>A violent attack on a pool hall in Santo Domingo, Ecuador, has resulted in seven deaths and four injuries, marking the second such incident in the city in under a month. Authorities attribute the violence to a territorial dispute between organized crime groups, a persistent issue in the country which serves as a hub for drug trafficking. This event is part of a recent wave of similar massacres, reflecting a significant rise in homicides and ongoing challenges with gang violence in Ecuador.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized New York Governor Kathy Hochul for endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor. On his social media platform, Trump referred to Mamdani as a "Liddle Communist" and suggested that federal funding for the city could be at risk if he is elected. The endorsement from Hochul is seen as a significant boost for Mamdani, who is a self-described democratic socialist leading in the polls.</p>

The dismissal was prompted by the emergence of emails showing supportive messages Mandelson sent to Epstein in 2008 after his initial guilty plea.</p>

          <p>Russia has initiated large-scale military drills in Belarus, showcasing its firepower at a time of high tension with NATO, particularly after a recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace. The 'Zapad' exercises, which involve around 7,000 troops, simulate a defense against Western forces and are expected to include demonstrations of Russia's nuclear and hypersonic missile capabilities. Despite the Kremlin's claims that the drills are defensive, NATO countries like Poland and Lithuania have heightened their military alert in response.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve rate cut expected, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers on how to navigate the changing market. Key recommendations include getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, promptly comparing offers from multiple lenders, and strategically locking in a favorable rate. However, they also caution against assuming rates will continue to fall or overextending budgets, stressing the importance of disciplined financial planning even as lower rates create a more competitive environment.

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are experiencing confusion as their loans are transferred to new servicing companies, sometimes with little direct notification. One borrower reported their loans were moved from Nelnet to a new servicer, Central Research, Inc., and placed in an administrative forbearance without their request. Experts advise that while this forbearance shouldn't affect credit, borrowers should be cautious about making payments during the transition to avoid them getting lost, and should verify their account status once the transfer is complete.</p>

          <p>Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK, stating that the Tory party is "over" as a national political force. Kruger, who served as a shadow minister under Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, announced his move alongside Reform leader Nigel Farage, whom he endorsed as the next prime minister. This high-profile defection is a significant blow to the Conservative party, signaling a potential realignment on the British right and increasing pressure on Badenoch's leadership.</p>

          <p>The watermelon has become a potent symbol of Palestinian identity and resistance, largely because its colors—red, green, black, and white—mirror those of the Palestinian flag. Its use as a protest symbol originated in the 1980s after Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in occupied territories, with an Israeli officer reportedly suggesting even a watermelon painting would be confiscated. Today, the symbol is used globally in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and on social media to express solidarity and circumvent censorship.</p>

Experts recommend using AI for polishing a self-written draft rather than for initial generation, and always proofreading carefully to ensure accuracy and maintain a personal voice.</p>
