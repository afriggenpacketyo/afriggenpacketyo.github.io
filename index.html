          <p>President Donald Trump has called off a scheduled meeting with top congressional Democrats, raising the probability of a federal government shutdown. The talks were intended to address a funding deal, but Trump cited "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democrats as the reason for the cancellation. Democratic leaders are insisting that any agreement include extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits. Both sides are now blaming each other for the potential shutdown, which would begin after the September 30 deadline if no resolution is reached.</p>

          <p>At the United Nations General Assembly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivered a speech criticizing Washington for its trade tariffs and military actions while advocating for stronger ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected invitation for a meeting, citing "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter. This development occurred amid heightened tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports. Trump's proposal for a meeting next week suggests a potential diplomatic opening between the two leaders despite their public disagreements.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has confirmed that winger Noni Madueke is expected to be out for six to eight weeks due to a knee injury he sustained during a match against Manchester City. The 23-year-old summer signing was substituted at halftime, and while tests are ongoing, the club is hopeful it is not a more severe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Manager Mikel Arteta stated that the injury's full extent is not yet known but described it as being out for "a few weeks." The injury is a significant setback for both Arsenal and the England national team, impacting key upcoming domestic and international fixtures.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Nontraditional Factors in Heart Attacks Are Often Missed, Especially in Women</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Mayo Clinic indicates that over half of heart attacks in women under 65 are caused by nontraditional factors that are frequently overlooked or misdiagnosed. While clogged arteries are the most common cause in men, conditions like spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and embolisms are more prevalent in women's cardiac events. Researchers found that SCAD is nearly six times more common in women and is often misdiagnosed, potentially leading to inappropriate treatments. The findings underscore the need for clinicians to consider a broader range of causes for heart attacks, particularly in younger female patients.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Acknowledges 'Challenging Situation' of Rising Inflation and Slowing Job Market</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has described the current economic climate as a "challenging situation," citing the dual pressures of rising inflation and a slowdown in hiring. Speaking after the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates, Powell noted that downside risks to employment have increased, shifting the central bank's focus toward the labor market. However, he also expressed concern about high uncertainty around the path of inflation, creating a difficult balancing act for policymakers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr's recent threats to revoke broadcast licenses from networks over Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments are analyzed as largely unenforceable and contrary to the agency's history. Revoking a license is an extreme measure rarely used by the FCC, especially over content, due to First Amendment protections for free speech. The article suggests Carr's real leverage is not license revocation but the FCC's regulatory power over media mergers and acquisitions. This pressure may explain why major affiliate owners like Nexstar and Sinclair, who have business pending before the FCC, chose to preempt Kimmel's show, using fear and financial incentives as a tool for influence.</p>

          <p>During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump criticized the organization and its New York headquarters, recounting his unsuccessful bid to manage the building's renovation years ago. He claimed he could have completed the project for far less money and with superior materials, stating the UN did not understand construction. Trump's remarks were part of a broader critique of the UN's effectiveness, which he said has not lived up to its potential, often relying on "empty words." The speech also touched on his familiar themes, including criticism of immigration policies and climate change initiatives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a decree officially classifying the Antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization, directing the government to dismantle its operations and funding. The term Antifa, short for "anti-fascist action," refers to a decentralized, leaderless coalition of left-wing groups and individuals opposing fascism and right-wing ideologies. While some factions engage in non-violent activism, others are militant, leading to ongoing debate over their methods. Legal experts have previously raised concerns that such a designation is difficult under U.S. law due to the movement's lack of formal structure and potential conflicts with First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more attractive borrowing option for homeowners. For a $60,000 HELOC at the current average rate of 8.05%, monthly payments would be approximately $730 for a 10-year repayment period or $575 for a 15-year period. A key advantage of a HELOC is its variable rate, which could lead to lower payments if the Fed enacts further cuts as anticipated. Additionally, borrowers only pay interest on the amount they use, providing flexibility in an uncertain economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the transnational gang Barrio 18 as a foreign terrorist organization. The department stated that the gang, one of the largest in the Northern Hemisphere, has conducted attacks on officials and civilians in Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This designation places Barrio 18 on a list with other criminal groups like MS-13 and various drug cartels, which the Trump administration has increasingly targeted with this classification. The move is part of a broader administration strategy to dismantle gangs and cartels to enhance American safety.</p>

          <p>Boeing's stock rose following reports that the U.S. and China are nearing a deal for a substantial order of its aircraft, a development linked to broader trade negotiations. U.S. officials in Beijing indicated that talks are in their final stages for what could be China's first major Boeing purchase since before President Trump's first term. This potential deal is part of a larger trend where countries are including large Boeing orders in trade agreements with the U.S. to address trade imbalances. The positive news aligns with investment theses that geopolitical negotiations would drive sales for the American manufacturer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank's independence, dismissing claims that its decisions are politically motivated as a "cheap shot." Without naming President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized him, Powell asserted that the Fed's policies are driven by economic data, not political pressure. The comments come amid an ongoing campaign by the Trump administration to exert more control over the Fed's board. Powell also reiterated that the recent interest rate cut was a response to a challenging economic situation with rising inflation risks and a weakening labor market.</p>

          <p>A group of 34 Palestinian students who were awarded scholarships to UK universities have arrived in the country to begin their academic programs after being evacuated from Gaza. This is the first time since the conflict began that students have been assisted in leaving the territory for educational purposes in the UK. After a period of uncertainty, the students were transported to Jordan for visa processing before traveling to Britain. While celebrating the opportunity, supporters note the difficult emotional toll on the students, whose families remain in Gaza, and are campaigning for remaining eligible students to be evacuated soon.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from CDC scientists, U.S. infection rates from highly drug-resistant bacteria, known as "nightmare bacteria," increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The surge was primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort treatments like carbapenems. Researchers suggest that the rise may be linked to increased antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, collected from 29 states, likely underestimates the true national total, raising serious concerns about the potential for community spread and the challenge of treating once-routine infections.</p>

          <p>Nexstar and Sinclair, two of the largest owners of local TV stations in the U.S., have announced they will continue to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' on their ABC-affiliated channels. The decision stands despite ABC reinstating the show after a week-long suspension over controversial comments Kimmel made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The station groups, which control a significant portion of ABC's affiliates, cited the need for respectful dialogue and stood by their initial decision to pull the program. This move highlights a growing tension between national networks and their local affiliate partners over programming content.</p>

Key topics on the agenda are expected to include the AUKUS security pact, U.S. demands for increased Australian defense spending, and trade tariffs. The announcement came after Trump used his UN speech to criticize allies, including Australia, for their moves to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

The committee's work had been instrumental in changing laws and policies related to women's service. The dissolution follows a broader review of advisory committees, with the Pentagon emphasizing a need for alignment with a "warrior ethos" and sex-neutral standards.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Ryder Cup team is facing controversy over its decision to accept payments of $500,000 per player, a stark contrast to the European team, which traditionally plays without compensation. While $300,000 of the payment must be donated to charity, the remaining $200,000 stipend has allowed Team Europe to claim the moral high ground, emphasizing they play for pride and cause. The move to pay players, modeled after the Presidents Cup, has created a narrative of American golfers being motivated by money. This adds a contentious dynamic to the event, which could intensify if the U.S. team does not win.</p>
