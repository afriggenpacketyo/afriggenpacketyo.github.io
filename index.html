          <p>This article revisits the unsolved case of George Smith, who vanished during his honeymoon cruise in 2005. Suspicion initially fell on his widow, Jennifer, but the FBI later focused on a group of young men who were the last to see him alive. The investigation revealed failed polygraphs, questionable alibis, and a provocative video made by some of the men shortly after Smith's disappearance. The article details the events leading up to his disappearance, including his time in the casino and disco, and the discovery of a bloodstain on a lifeboat canopy. Despite years of investigation, the case remains open, with the family continuing their search for answers and justice. Optimism regarding a resolution is tempered by the FBI's previous closure of the case. The article highlights the complexities and unanswered questions surrounding this enduring mystery. </p>

          <p>This article details the aftermath of the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, including reactions from airlines regarding employees' social media posts, the firing of a sports reporter for refusing to mourn, and the outpouring of support for Kirk's family. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines took action against employees who made celebratory or mocking remarks about Kirk's death. A Phoenix Suns reporter was fired for his social media comments declining to mourn Kirk, leading to a GoFundMe campaign in his support. Supporters have donated nearly $1 million to Kirk's family, sharing messages of faith and personal testimony. Oregon football coach Dan Lanning offered condolences and called for gun reform, while the article underscores the deep divisions and strong reactions following Kirk's death. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the bullish sentiment in the US stock market, noting that while optimism is high, there are several risks that could derail the rally. These risks include potential cracks in the artificial intelligence theme, the ongoing trade war initiated by President Trump, increasing government debt, and a weakening labor market. Despite these concerns, many Wall Street strategists have raised their targets for the S&P 500, anticipating further gains due to expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. The article highlights that valuations are at rich levels, making the market vulnerable to these potential negative catalysts. </p>

Clayton Kershaw had a shaky start, but the team responded with timely hitting and solid bullpen performance, save for a shaky outing from Kirby Yates.

          <p>California lawmakers have passed measures to allow the construction of 2,000 new oil wells annually in the San Joaquin Valley while also restricting offshore drilling. Senate Bill 237 aims to stabilize crude-oil refineries and address concerns about gas prices. The bill also includes a provision allowing the governor to suspend summer-blend gasoline fuel standards if prices spike. Environmentalists have criticized the measures as a giveaway to Big Oil, while supporters argue they are necessary to stabilize the energy market during the transition to clean energy. </p>
