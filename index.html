          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, was arrested after allegedly firing at least three rounds into the ABC10 building in Sacramento. No injuries were reported in the drive-by shooting, which is still under investigation for a motive. Initially released on bail for local charges, Hernandez-Santana was subsequently re-arrested by the FBI on a federal charge of interfering with a radio communications station. The incident has been condemned by public officials, including California's governor, as an attack on democracy and journalism.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens displayed visible frustration during the team's 31-14 loss to the Chicago Bears. After a pass from quarterback Dak Prescott deflected off his hands and resulted in an interception, Pickens was seen slamming his helmet on the ground on the sideline. Despite this moment, he had a productive game with five catches for 68 yards and a touchdown earlier in the contest. The loss brings the Cowboys' season record to 1-2, matching that of the victorious Bears.</p>

          <p>People with terminal illnesses are increasingly creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final stages of life. This practice is gaining recognition in palliative care for its therapeutic benefits, as music can evoke powerful memories and reduce anxiety, even in unconscious patients. Experts note that hearing is one of the last senses to fade, allowing music to keep patients connected to their loved ones and surroundings. These playlists also offer lasting comfort to grieving family members after a person has passed away.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher on Monday, following gains on Wall Street, as investors anticipated China's decision on its loan prime rates. China is expected to hold its key lending rates steady, a move that would follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all saw early gains. The positive sentiment was buoyed by a strong week in U.S. markets, where the Dow and S&P 500 reached new all-time highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German and Swedish fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian IL-20M reconnaissance aircraft flying in neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea without a flight plan or radio contact. The German military identified the plane before handing over the escort to their Swedish NATO partners. This incident is the latest in a series of recent incursions by Russian military aircraft into or near NATO airspace, which has heightened regional tensions. These provocations have prompted NATO members like Estonia and Poland to invoke Article 4 for alliance consultations.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance took a central role following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, positioning himself as a key figure within the MAGA movement and a potential 2028 presidential frontrunner. By emphasizing his Christian faith at Kirk's memorial service and personally escorting the casket, Vance has sought to connect with Kirk's young, religious followers. His actions are seen as a "soft launch" for a future campaign, building on his populist profile and close ties to President Trump. This strategic positioning suggests an effort to consolidate support from both Turning Point USA's youth base and the broader Republican establishment.</p>

          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 families, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than just teaching polite phrases, these parents focus on creating an environment of emotional safety. They also teach children how to repair relationships after conflict and validate their feelings, which builds a strong foundation for emotionally intelligent communication.</p>

McFadden argued the current system creates an "unhealthy" binary between being fit or unfit for work, trapping people and increasing the benefits bill.

The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," aims to create mice with a heritable immunity to Lyme, which would break the infection cycle as ticks feeding on them would not become carriers. The team, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, is working closely with the community on Nantucket, an island with a high incidence of the disease, to ensure public buy-in before any potential release.

          <p>Dong Yu, a key figure in drafting several of China's five-year plans, explains that these economic blueprints are fundamentally about improving public income and sustainable progress. In an interview, the executive vice-president of a Tsinghua University institute stated that while early plans focused on building a foundational national economy, modern plans have successfully guided the country's development since its reform period. As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, the focus remains on ensuring that economic development translates into tangible benefits and a higher quality of life for its citizens.</p>

          <p>An analysis shows that hypothetical $7,000 investments made at the start of 2023 in Palantir, AppLovin, and Carvana would have grown to over $1.1 million combined. These companies, once unprofitable, have seen their fortunes reverse due to factors like improved economic conditions, successful restructuring, and a strategic focus on AI. Palantir has capitalized on AI-driven data analytics, AppLovin has leveraged AI in advertising technology, and Carvana successfully navigated bankruptcy concerns. While their stock performance has been explosive, their current high valuations may suggest significant risk for new investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell, are likely to be part of an investment group to purchase TikTok's U.S. operations. The sale is mandated by a law passed over concerns about the Chinese parent company ByteDance's access to American user data. Trump described the potential investors as "American patriots" and expressed confidence in a deal being reached with China to keep the popular social media app operating in the U.S. under American ownership. The deal would place significant influence over the platform in the hands of powerful U.S. media and tech figures.</p>

According to reports, federal health officials plan to warn pregnant women against using the painkiller unless they have a fever. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, has strongly disputed any causal link, stating that over a decade of research shows no credible evidence and that such claims could pose a health risk to expecting mothers.

He referenced his own experience with political violence, including an April firebombing at the governor's mansion. Shapiro emphasized the legal distinction between protected, even hateful, political speech and illicit incitement to violence, urging Americans to reject the latter in all forms.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young saved an extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch off his own foot after the ball was dislodged from his glove at the wall. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping catch at the top of the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run.

In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-term goal of complete denuclearization, given that Pyongyang is producing numerous new weapons annually. He expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume talks, citing a degree of mutual trust between them. This pragmatic stance aims to reduce immediate tensions on the Korean peninsula while not abandoning the ultimate goal of a nuclear-free state.</p>

The government has touted the expansion as a "no-brainer for growth," anticipating job creation and an economic boost.
