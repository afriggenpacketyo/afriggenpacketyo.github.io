          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement framework with the United Kingdom, the first since pausing "Liberation Day" tariffs. The agreement involves adjusting tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, with the UK easing trade barriers on ethanol, beef, and machinery. The deal also includes a $10 billion purchase of Boeing airplane parts and a secure pharmaceutical supply chain. Both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer acknowledged that some details still need to be finalized in the coming weeks, aiming for a broader deal to benefit both countries.</p>

          <p>The Pakistan Cricket Board is considering postponing the remainder of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) due to escalating tensions between Pakistan and India. A match in Rawalpindi was postponed after Pakistan claimed Indian drones were destroyed in several cities, although these claims are unverified. Concerns over player safety are paramount, especially with multiple English players involved, who are discussing whether to return to the UK. The situation escalated after India launched strikes in response to a militant attack in Kashmir, further complicating the tournament's completion.</p>

          <p>Debt collectors can refuse payments if they are partial, meant to settle the debt for less than owed, or if the account is in litigation, with the debt remaining active and accruing interest. Payment refusal can also occur if there are issues with the payment source, such as third-party accounts or potential fraud. Negotiating a higher settlement offer, working with a debt relief expert, considering a debt management plan, or filing for bankruptcy are alternative strategies to resolve collection debt. Thorough documentation of attempted payments and communication with the debt collector is crucial in such situations.</p>

It explores the impact of chronic exposure to stress and trauma on officers' mental health, the stigma against seeking help, and the need for better support systems within police departments.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need to assess the impact of Trump's policies before making any decisions on interest rates. Economists now anticipate a potential rate cut in September or later, with some considering a larger-than-usual cut to shore up the economy. The Fed's caution stems from persistent inflation and uncertainty surrounding trade policy, requiring concrete evidence of economic weakness before lowering rates.</p>

The deal scraps a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports. Discussions on pharmaceuticals and digital services tax are ongoing. The agreement is a narrow deal with months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.</p>
