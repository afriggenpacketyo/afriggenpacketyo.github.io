          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a proclamation that suspends travel to the U.S. for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns related to insufficient vetting processes. The policy also partially restricts entrance for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the ban as discriminatory, while the administration asserts it is necessary to protect the U.S. from potential threats, mirroring a similar ban from 2017 that was later upheld by the Supreme Court and then ended by President Biden in 2021. The new policy exempts U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with proof of identity and relationship. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether individuals working for former President Joe Biden conspired to deceive the public about his mental state by using an autopen to sign presidential documents. Trump's memo alleges that Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures to conceal his cognitive decline and assert Article II authority, arguing this constitutes a dangerous scandal. The investigation aims to determine if Biden's advisors purposefully shielded the public from information about his health and if agreements were made to falsely elevate his capabilities. House Republicans, led by Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, have also launched an investigation into Biden's fitness to authorize the use of the autopen. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University for an initial six months, citing national security concerns.

Harvard has condemned the proclamation as retaliatory and a violation of its First Amendment rights, pledging to protect its international students. The administration has cited Harvard's connections with China as a reason for the restrictions, claiming the university is linked to research that could advance China's military modernization. </p>

The referendum, spurred by a grassroots organization that gathered half a million signatures, aims to address obstacles faced by many immigrants seeking citizenship due to clerical errors and systemic issues. While the government has been tightening citizenship rules, this vote presents an opportunity to make the bureaucracy more benevolent and recognize the diversity of its residents.

          <p>Negotiations over Iran's nuclear program face uncertainty as the U.S. and Iran disagree on the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal, stating that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its soil. President Trump has asserted that the agreement would not allow any enrichment of uranium. Both U.S. and Iranian officials have expressed pessimism, with an Iranian official calling the U.S.' proposed terms "unreasonable". </p>

Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study highlights the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as an essential feature of bird evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly. </p>
