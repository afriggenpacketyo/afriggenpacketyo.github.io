          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric car battery maker, restricted onshore U.S. investors from participating in its Hong Kong share sale due to escalating tensions between the United States and China. This move marks a significant shift from a decade prior when Chinese companies like Alibaba actively sought U.S. investment. The decision reflects growing concerns over national security and financial decoupling, with potential implications for other Chinese technology companies. CATL, which supplies batteries to major automakers like GM and Tesla, aims to use the raised funds for European expansion, even as it faces political scrutiny in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail stated that the company does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity improvements. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to offset tariff costs. Home Depot has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China, aiming to have no single country outside the U.S. represent more than 10% of its purchases by next year. While the company missed first-quarter earnings expectations, it beat sales estimates and maintained its full-year sales forecast, contingent on current tariff agreements.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 when McIver and other Democratic lawmakers visited the detention center, leading to a confrontation with ICE agents. At the same time, the Justice Department dropped a misdemeanor trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during the same incident after being denied entry to the facility. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions, while the dismissal of charges against Baraka was described as being ‚Äúfor the sake of moving forward‚Äù.</p>

          <p>Christopher Thuss, a fisherman, discovered the J.C. Ames, a tugboat built in 1881, in Lake Michigan near Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Historical Society confirmed the discovery, noting the ship was intentionally sunk in 1923 after becoming obsolete. Maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen highlighted the significance of such discoveries in resurfacing lost history and noted the ship was once one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the lakes. The ship was dismantled and burned before being abandoned, a common practice at the time, and the discovery was made possible due to favorable weather conditions.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg share a fondness for Iain M. Banks's Culture series, a socialist science fiction saga, which is surprising given their capitalist ideologies. The Culture envisions a post-scarcity galactic society valuing empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation, starkly contrasting Silicon Valley's ethos. The most detestable villain in Banks‚Äôs series is a wealthy man who uses his riches to purchase and influence media outlets, undercut labor unions, and sexual assault his indentured servants. While the tech moguls may be drawn to the series' technological prowess, they seem to miss the underlying critique of capitalism and inequality.</p>

The legislation has exposed rifts between fiscal conservatives demanding deficit reduction, members seeking to protect Medicaid access, and blue-state Republicans pushing to lift the cap on state and local tax deductions. Trump's persuasive skills will be tested as he attempts to bridge these divides and meet Speaker Johnson's Memorial Day deadline.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump are embroiled in a public feud after Springsteen criticized Trump's administration as "corrupt, incompetent and treasonous" during a concert in England. Trump responded by calling Springsteen a "dried out prune of a rocker" and suggested he and Beyonc√© should be investigated for illegal campaign donations. Springsteen has long been a political opponent of Trump and has campaigned for Democratic candidates. The exchange highlights the ongoing tension between the two figures, who represent starkly different constituencies within American society.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that markets and central bankers are underestimating the risks posed by record U.S. deficits, tariffs, and international tensions. Dimon believes that the risks of higher inflation and stagflation are not adequately reflected in current stock market valuations. He anticipates that Wall Street earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies will decline further, potentially leading to a fall in stock prices. Dimon also noted that corporate clients remain in a "wait-and-see" mode regarding acquisitions and other deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shipments of smartphones made in China to the United States, including Apple's iPhone, have plummeted to their lowest levels since 2011. The drop is attributed to the impact of U.S. tariffs, which have disrupted tech supply chains and shifted electronics production to other locations. The decline underscores the growing economic tensions between the U.S. and China, with investors fearing a global trade war that could erode bilateral trade and increase consumer prices. Recent sanctions on Huawei Technologies artificial intelligence chips have further strained relations.</p>
