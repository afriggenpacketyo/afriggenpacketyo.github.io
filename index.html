            <p>Several statues in London's Parliament Square, including one of women's suffrage campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett, were vandalized during a transgender rights protest. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incidents as criminal damage after protesters gathered to oppose a Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' based on biological sex for the Equality Act. Graffiti, including 'trans rights are human rights,' was found on a statue of former South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts. Police are reviewing social media for signs and images displayed at the protest that may breach the law, and the Greater London Authority is working to remove the graffiti using specialist equipment.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration and accused of MS-13 membership. Van Hollen emphasized that his mission was to ensure due process for Abrego Garcia, who has never been convicted of a crime, and expressed concerns about his treatment in a Salvadoran mega-jail. Despite a Supreme Court order to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's return, the Trump administration insists he will not be allowed back into the U.S., citing his alleged gang affiliation. Van Hollen criticized the administration for flouting the courts and jeopardizing the constitutional rights of all Americans.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project, a massive natural gas pipeline and export facility, to secure trade deals and avoid potential tariffs from the U.S. government. The Alaska LNG project, which has been on the drawing board for years, involves building an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet, where gas would be liquefied for export. The Trump administration views Alaska LNG as a strategically important project, offering a direct route for LNG exports to Asia, bypassing congested routes like the Panama Canal. The project aims to produce 20 million metric tons of LNG per year, significantly boosting U.S. LNG exports.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military (IDF) inquiry concluded that an 'operational misunderstanding' led to the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza. The IDF claimed its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces in a 'hostile and dangerous combat zone', and cited poor visibility as a contributing factor. The report stated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, but did not provide evidence for this claim. The deputy commander of the unit involved was dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report, and the IDF acknowledged that the killing of a UN worker shortly afterward was 'a breach of orders during a combat setting'.</p>

            <p>Officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have revised the death toll from a boat fire in Equateur province to 33, significantly lower than initial reports of 148 fatalities. The incident occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers near Mbandaka, involving a motorized wooden boat carrying approximately 400 people. The mayor of Mbandaka attributed the discrepancy in death toll reports to 'confusion' following the incident. Congolese police believe the fire was ignited by cooking activities onboard the vessel, highlighting the risks associated with boat travel due to overcrowding and inadequate safety measures.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, an online marketplace for used and refurbished tech devices, reports a tripling of sales following President Trump's tariff announcements on goods imported from China. Consumers are reportedly engaging in 'panic-buying' due to concerns about potential price increases on new electronics. This surge in sales suggests that more Americans may opt for used or refurbished devices if tariffs raise prices on new electronics, presenting an opportunity to change consumer habits. While some analysts predict a short-term boost for the used market, they anticipate that most consumers will eventually return to buying new tech when their finances allow.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court's order prevents the Trump administration from removing Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the AEA, potentially sending the detainees to a horrific foreign prison without due process. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, claiming the court acted hastily and prematurely, while White House officials asserted the detainees were 'foreign terrorists'.</p>

            <p>The article critiques the reliance on unconventional metrics, such as lipstick sales or men's underwear purchases, as indicators of an impending recession. It argues that while media and economists often cite consumer sentiment, unemployment, and GDP, these are unreliable predictors. The author suggests focusing on real data from companies driving consumer spending, capital investment, and labor markets, such as Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and Paychex. By analyzing these companies' earnings reports and statements, a more accurate assessment of the economy's health can be obtained compared to relying on surveys or government data.</p>

            <p>The construction industry, traditionally male-dominated, is exploring the use of technology and AI to attract more women. Companies like LAT are using robotic dogs and digital apps to automate data collection and streamline administrative tasks, making jobs less physically demanding and more appealing. The industry faces a shortage of skilled labor, and efforts are underway to create more flexible work arrangements and promote diversity. The use of BIM (Building Information Modeling) is also simplifying communication and reducing conflicts on construction sites, further enhancing the work environment.</p>

            <p>A 14-year-old girl was killed by a lion on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya, after being snatched from a residential compound near Nairobi National Park. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is searching for the lion and has implemented additional security measures to prevent further attacks. This incident follows another recent death where a man was killed by an elephant in central Nyeri county. Conservationists are urging KWS to improve risk assessments and communication regarding wildlife movements, while also recommending that lodges and residential areas near wildlife habitats be equipped with deterrent systems.</p>

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens over their alleged actions at pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza. The Berlin Immigration Office has issued orders instructing them to leave Germany by April 21, citing a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024 where 'masked individuals' caused 'property damage including graffiti'. Critics are drawing comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S., and lawyers are appealing the deportation orders, arguing they clash with EU law guaranteeing freedom of movement.</p>

            <p>As investors face potential recession fears and anxiety over tariff policy, dividend stocks can help stabilize portfolios. Financial advisors recommend rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance and timeline, building cash reserves to avoid selling investments during market downturns, and considering a 'bond ladder'. These strategies aim to protect retirement savings from market volatility, especially during the initial years of retirement, and ensure a steady income stream. Maintaining a diversified portfolio and consulting with a financial advisor are also advised. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The author reflects on a past dating lie and the prevalence of dishonesty in modern romance, inspired by a new dating show featuring a lie detection system. They acknowledge the harm caused by egregious lies about relationships, preferences, or intentions, but question whether all dating lies are inherently awful. They suggest that some lies stem from insecurity or attempts at politeness, akin to 'butler lies,' and are efforts to present a better version of oneself. The author concludes that while honesty is important, compassion and understanding may be warranted in certain situations.</p>
