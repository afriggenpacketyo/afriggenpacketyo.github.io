          <p>A significant wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has prompted acting Governor Tahesha Way to declare a state of emergency. The Jones Road Wildfire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has burned across thousands of acres, leading to mandatory evacuations and power outages for many residents. While evacuation orders have been lifted and major roads have reopened, the fire remains only partially contained, and smoke is affecting a wide area, potentially reaching New York City. Fire officials continue to battle the blaze, with no reported injuries so far, using various methods to establish containment lines and protect structures.</p>

          <p>Recent explorations of the USS Yorktown, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier sunk during World War II's Battle of Midway, have yielded remarkable discoveries, including the first-ever underwater aircraft from the battle. A remotely operated camera sent inside the ship located at least three Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers on the hanger deck, one still armed, as well as plane wings and a hand-painted mural depicting the Yorktown's travels. The mission also revealed diverse marine life inhabiting the wreck, which is protected by the Naval History and Heritage Command and serves as a memorial for servicemen who died during the battle.</p>

          <p>Several corporations, including Johnson & Johnson, Apple, Chobani, and Nvidia, have recently announced significant investments in expanding their manufacturing capabilities within the United States. These announcements coincide with the implementation of new tariffs by the Trump administration, although companies cite various factors such as meeting demand, expanding into AI, and reducing costs associated with imported goods. Economists remain skeptical about the direct impact of tariffs on spurring domestic investment, highlighting the importance of factors like labor costs, tax rates, and regulatory environments. These investments could create new jobs and foster innovation across multiple sectors.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, the owner of a paddleboard firm, has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding excursion on the Western Cleddau river in Wales. Lloyd, an unqualified instructor, led a group of seven participants in hazardous conditions, resulting in the deaths of Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley. The court found Lloyd guilty of gross negligence manslaughter, citing her abysmal approach to safety and her decision to navigate a dangerous weir, leading to the tragic incident.

          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a significant rally after President Donald Trump indicated that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced substantially. This announcement, coupled with Trump's apparent softening stance on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, boosted investor confidence. Tesla shares also saw a notable increase following news that CEO Elon Musk would be reducing his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency, allowing him to focus more on the company. The positive sentiment extended to other major tech companies, contributing to overall market gains as investors reacted favorably to the prospect of de-escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The European Union has levied fines totaling €700 million on Apple and Meta for violations of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to curb the power of large technology companies.

Both companies have criticized the EU's actions, with Meta accusing the EU of unfairly targeting American businesses and Apple claiming it is being forced to give away its technology for free.

          <p>The pro-natalism movement, advocating for increased birth rates, is gaining traction within the Trump administration, with figures like Malcolm and Simone Collins advising on policies to encourage American women to have more children. Their proposals include fertility awareness classes and "baby bonuses," while some activists suggest limiting Fulbright grants to scholars with children. Critics argue that these initiatives overlook crucial support for existing mothers, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare, and aim to enforce regressive social roles for women.

          <p>Refugees from Myanmar residing in camps along the Thai-Myanmar border are facing significant cuts in food aid due to a foreign aid shortfall and rising demand. These cuts will affect over 80% of the 100,000-plus refugees, many of whom rely on the aid for survival as they are barred from working outside the camps. The Border Consortium, which supplies the camps, is reducing allowances due to a cut in funding from the US State Department, inflation, and an increase in refugee numbers following the 2021 coup in Myanmar. This situation is exacerbating food insecurity and malnutrition among the refugees.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to resume collections on defaulted student loans, impacting millions of borrowers who have not made payments for the past five years. This decision raises concerns for families already struggling with economic instability and tariff-related price increases. Borrowers in default may face wage garnishment and seizure of tax refunds or Social Security benefits. Experts advise borrowers to explore options such as loan consolidation and rehabilitation to avoid these consequences. The administration claims the move is necessary to relieve the burden on taxpayers and emphasize that there will be no mass loan forgiveness.</p>
