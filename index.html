          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, compounded by Elon Musk's public feud with President Trump. The conflict, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value. This rift threatens the company's relationship with the administration, potentially impacting future regulations and government support. Tesla's board is facing pressure to ensure the company's stability amidst Musk's polarizing actions, which have also led to protests and boycotts. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he pleaded not guilty.

          <p>The government is struggling to reduce the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with the Home Office planning to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25, primarily covering accommodation costs for asylum seekers. The Home Office aims to end asylum hotels and expedite asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money. However, the scale of aid spending on asylum hotels has resulted in significant cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities worldwide.</p>
