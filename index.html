          <p>Amid growing concerns of famine in Gaza, at least 25 Palestinians were killed overnight by Israeli airstrikes and gunfire. According to hospital officials, the majority of the victims were shot while waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. This incident occurs as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled, with the U.S. and Israeli teams being recalled from talks. The international community is increasing pressure on Israel to address the severe humanitarian crisis, as aid organizations struggle to deliver food and supplies due to military restrictions and dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for Donald Trump's four-day private visit. The US president is staying at his Trump Turnberry golf resort, where he was seen playing a round of golf accompanied by his son Eric. The visit includes planned meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scotland's First Minister John Swinney to discuss various issues, including trade. Protests against the visit have been organized in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, while police have implemented road closures and extensive security measures around the resort, raising concerns about the cost and impact on local policing.</p>

          <p>The UK government has strongly condemned Hong Kong's offer of cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in Britain, labeling it an act of "transnational repression." Hong Kong authorities are offering up to $125,000 for help in apprehending 19 individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law. In a joint statement, the UK's Foreign and Home Secretaries reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights and safety of Hong Kongers in the UK. This move further strains relations, as the UK has already taken steps to sever extradition ties with Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters chose not to oust two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT), thereby maintaining the current legislative balance of power. The effort, backed by supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), sought to remove politicians seen as too accommodating to China. However, the failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's administration will continue to face a strong opposition bloc in the legislature. The outcome signals potential difficulties for the DPP's agenda ahead of local elections and reinforces the existing political deadlock on the self-ruled island.</p>

It traces his journey from a difficult childhood and being fired from Black Sabbath for substance abuse to a massively successful solo career and a second act as a beloved television personality on 'The Osbournes'. The author notes Osbourne's complex persona, a blend of the 'Prince of Darkness' and a bumbling suburban dad, who embodied both recklessness and resilience. The piece concludes that Osbourne, who recently reunited with Black Sabbath, truly lived up to his desire not to die an ordinary man.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, conditions in Niger have deteriorated, according to analysts and citizens. The junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, justified the takeover by citing insecurity and economic hardship, but many of these issues have worsened. The regime has cracked down on NGOs, leading to significant job losses in a country already facing high youth unemployment. Furthermore, human rights groups report a severe decline in freedom of expression and the arbitrary detention of former officials, with little prospect of a near-term return to civilian democratic rule.</p>

          <p>Writing from her home in Scotland, American comedian Krystal Evans expresses her frustration with Donald Trump's visit to the country. She reflects on why she avoids discussing him in her comedy, noting the mental exhaustion his presence causes. Evans contrasts Trump's desperate desire to be embraced as Scottish with his actual persona, suggesting he fundamentally misunderstands the nation's character. She invokes the memory of the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley, whose famously defiant protest sign during a previous Trump visit perfectly captured the sentiment of many Scots, embodying a spirit of humorous rebellion that Trump will never grasp.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Columbia University's recent deal with the Trump administration marks a grave turning point for American higher education. The author contends that Columbia, facing the threat of losing federal research funding, capitulated to an extortion scheme, sacrificing its academic independence. The agreement allows a Trump-approved monitor to review admissions and oversee the Middle Eastern studies department, setting a dangerous precedent for government overreach. The author suggests this is not an isolated incident but a template the administration will use to suppress dissent and control other institutions, undermining the role of civil society.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if managed carefully. Charging expenses to a rewards card and immediately paying the balance with savings can help couples earn points or miles for things like a honeymoon. However, experts warn against carrying wedding-related debt, as high interest rates can create financial stress at the start of a marriage. The key is to avoid sacrificing long-term financial well-being for a short-term event and to be aware of potential vendor fees for credit card payments.</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" has intensified debate over the viability of traditional late-night television. While some view the cancellation as a one-off financial decision by Paramount, others see it as a sign of the format's decline due to shifting viewer habits and the rise of streaming. The article notes the increasing costs and falling ad revenues for linear TV, which puts expensive productions like late-night shows under pressure. The future of the genre may become clearer when Disney decides the fate of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract is set to expire in 2026.</p>

While acknowledging universities' own failings, such as ideological narrowness among faculty and a focus on exclusivity, Roth insists these issues are being exploited to justify an authoritarian overreach.

The reigning NFL defensive rookie of the year said the workout showed him the level of dedication required to be an all-time great, and he is now striving to reach that standard in his own career.</p>

          <p>A proposed federal bill, the Captive Primate Safety Act, seeks to make the private ownership and breeding of primates illegal across all 50 states. Animal welfare experts argue that the pet trade fuels a brutal industry where poachers kill adult monkeys to capture their infants, who are then often smuggled and sold. These primates frequently suffer from severe stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage from being raised in unsuitable human environments. The bill, supported by a coalition of zoos and animal welfare groups, aims to slow this trade and protect primates from a life of suffering.</p>
