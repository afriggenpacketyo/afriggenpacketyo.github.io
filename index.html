          <p>Russia and Ukraine completed a large prisoner exchange, releasing 303 soldiers each, marking a rare moment of cooperation amid ongoing conflict. Despite the exchange, Russia continued its offensive, launching drone and missile attacks that killed at least 12 people and injured dozens. President Trump said he would consider further sanctions against Russia following the attacks.

The increase is attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in detection systems. The report identifies four categories of fake submissions: boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to combat fake reviews. The company is constantly working to improve its systems and catch fake reviews.</p>

          <p>Data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes indicates that small dwarf galaxies were responsible for the light in the early Universe. These galaxies emitted ionizing photons that cleared the murky hydrogen fog filling intergalactic space. The discovery reveals the role of ultra-faint galaxies in the early Universe's evolution. The findings show that dwarf galaxies are more abundant and brighter than expected, collectively emitting enough energy to reionize the Universe.</p>
