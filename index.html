          <p>A new music collection, "Sunset Boulevard," documents the final creative burst of Elvis Presley's career between 1972 and 1975, recorded before his death in 1977. The article reflects on this period, highlighting his disappointment over losing a role in "A Star Is Born," which some friends believe marked a turning point in his decline. The set showcases Presley's evolution into an expressive ballad singer, featuring hits like "Burning Love" and capturing his studio sessions and rehearsals with his TCB Band, offering a poignant look at a music icon grappling with his place in a changing cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with a decisive 3-0 victory over West Ham, their first top-flight win in August in over a decade. After a significant summer spending spree of around £132 million on new talent, the team demonstrated strong cohesion and skill. Goals from Championship play-off heroes Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard, along with a late addition by Wilson Isidor, secured the win. Pundits praised the team's organization and energy, suggesting the performance is a promising sign for their ability to remain in the top division.</p>

          <p>A rare subtropical wood stork, a species typically found in Gulf Coast states, was unexpectedly sighted in Columbia County, Wisconsin, approximately 1,000 miles from its home. The bird, listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, is believed to be a juvenile that got lost while exploring. This sighting highlights a positive trend for the species, whose population has grown from 5,000 nesting pairs in the 1970s to over 11,000 today due to protection efforts. However, experts note that climate change and habitat destruction continue to pose ongoing threats to their survival.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern Gaza Strip to establish "safe zones" before launching a renewed offensive targeting what it calls Hamas's final stronghold in Gaza City. The military agency COGAT stated that the supply of tents and shelter equipment for this purpose would resume on Sunday. This development comes as Israeli forces intensify operations on the outskirts of Gaza City.

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, Marah Abu Zuhri, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment due to severe emaciation, has died from cardiac arrest less than 48 hours after her arrival. Her death underscores the severe malnutrition crisis in Gaza, where the UN has warned of famine conditions and over 250 hunger-related deaths have been reported by Hamas-run ministries. The incident highlights the dire humanitarian situation, with over 61,000 Palestinians killed since the conflict began. Italy is one of several countries that have been evacuating patients from the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, rapidly strengthening to a powerful Category 5 storm with 160 mph winds. While currently north of the Leeward Islands, the hurricane is forecast to track between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast early next week. Although the storm is expected to remain offshore, it will likely generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the coast from August 20 to 27. The outer bands could also bring heavy rain and potential flash flooding to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands over the weekend.</p>

          <p>West Virginia will deploy 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington D.C. as part of the Trump administration's federal intervention aimed at addressing crime and homelessness in the city. This move follows President Trump's executive order to federalize local police and activate the D.C. National Guard, asserting tighter federal control over the district. While the administration justifies the action as an emergency response, D.C. officials have contested the premise, noting that violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term, and have described the intervention as a test of the city's limited self-governance.</p>

While the act has successfully helped some species like elephant seals recover, many marine mammals, including North Atlantic right whales and various dolphin populations, remain vulnerable. The author contends that growing threats from climate change, such as marine heat waves and algal blooms, make maintaining strong protections more urgent than ever, stating that saving these animals is intrinsically linked to preserving ocean health and, ultimately, ourselves.</p>

          <p>Australia achieved a remarkable comeback victory over world champions South Africa, winning 38-22 in the Rugby Championship opener in Johannesburg. After falling behind 22-0 in the first 20 minutes, the Wallabies rallied to secure their first win at Ellis Park since 1963. Captain Harry Wilson was instrumental, scoring two tries and leading a dominant performance at the breakdown. The stunning turnaround was completed with tries from four other players, culminating in a spectacular solo effort by Tom Wright to seal one of Australia's most memorable Test wins.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine.

He affirmed that the path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is scheduled to meet with Trump on Monday to continue discussions.</p>

          <p>A Denver man lost $17,000 to a scammer after calling the official United Airlines customer service number to rebook a canceled flight. The man, Dan Smoker, spent over three hours on the phone with an agent who he believed worked for United, only to later discover a fraudulent charge on his credit card. Call logs confirmed he initially dialed the correct number, but United's internal records showed the call lasting only 12 minutes, suggesting he was somehow transferred to an external scammer. The incident highlights a growing trend of sophisticated airline-related scams and has prompted an internal review by the airline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are strongly encouraging adults over the age of 60 to incorporate salmon into their diet to support heart health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower bad LDL cholesterol, raise good HDL cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. These benefits contribute to healthier blood vessels and a lower risk of heart attack and stroke. Since the heart is a muscle, consuming adequate protein is also vital for maintaining its strength and function as people age. Experts suggest eating omega-3-rich fish twice a week, prepared by baking or grilling.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is making a major comeback to the UK High Street, with plans to open new standalone stores for the first time since its collapse in 2020. The relaunch was kicked off with its first catwalk show in seven years, held in London's Trafalgar Square. Now owned by online retailer Asos, the brand aims to leverage nostalgia while also attracting a new generation of shoppers with its signature "London girl look." Industry experts note that while there is affection for the brand, its success will depend on navigating a competitive market and proving it can regain its former cultural relevance.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War Two, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native earned Britain's highest military honor for his bravery during a 1944 mission where he piloted a flying boat to attack and destroy a German U-boat despite sustaining 72 separate injuries. A flight lieutenant in the RAF, he was praised for his extraordinary determination and devotion to duty. After the war, he left the military for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions simply as his duty.</p>

Druze groups accuse the government of siding against them and committing atrocities, which resulted in around 1,600 deaths. This protest marks the first time the slogan of self-determination has been used by the community, signaling a significant shift in their political demands.</p>

This act of personal diplomacy comes as Putin faces an indictment from the International Criminal Court for his alleged role in these abductions, which Ukraine has labeled a war crime meeting the UN definition of genocide.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is tightening the requirements for U.S. citizenship by instructing immigration officers to apply greater scrutiny to the "good moral character" standard for applicants. New policy guidance expands the assessment beyond a simple criminal background check to a "holistic assessment" of an applicant's behavior, societal adherence, and positive contributions like community involvement. The directive also allows officers to consider technically lawful but socially irresponsible actions, such as habitual traffic infractions, as negative factors. Critics argue the policy is designed to create more grounds for denial and discourage legal immigrants from applying.</p>
