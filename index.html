          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, expressing concerns about research politicization, interrupted global collaboration, and budget cuts. The letter, named the Bethesda Declaration, calls for reinstating staff and restoring funding, emphasizing the risk of not speaking up against policies undermining the NIH mission. Scientists who signed the letter highlighted the difficulties in raising concerns internally, citing instances where research was hindered due to funding and travel restrictions. The NIH director, Jay Bhattacharya, responded by acknowledging the dissent but defending the agency's policy directions and support for international collaboration. The article details the scientists' concerns and the administration's response, showcasing the tensions between scientific research and political influence.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles regarding immigration policies led to a significant police presence outside federal buildings, with officers issuing warnings to disperse an unlawful assembly. Law enforcement strategically moved to secure the area, deploying SWAT teams and using less-lethal rounds and flash bangs to manage the crowds. The police action aimed to protect federal property and personnel amidst the ongoing demonstrations, resulting in some protesters scattering. Temple and Alameda Streets saw a large number of officers and vehicles deployed to maintain order and control the situation. The context of the protests involves widespread opposition to federal immigration enforcement operations in the area. The article conveys a sense of tension and strategic maneuvering by law enforcement to manage the protests.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, such as the director of the National Portrait Gallery, following President Trump's announcement of the director's firing. The Smithsonian's statement emphasized that the institution is governed by a Board of Regents and a Secretary, who manages the institution independently. This announcement followed a Board of Regents meeting to discuss the director's fate after Trump's social media post criticizing her as partisan and a supporter of DEI. The Smithsonian's move comes amid proposed budget cuts and an executive order demanding an end to federal funding for exhibitions based on racial themes, which could be seen as a rejection of political interference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests, citing it as an "unprecedented power grab." The lawsuit argues that President Trump unlawfully bypassed Governor Newsom by placing National Guard troops under federal control without the governor's permission. California contends that the law cited by the Trump administration does not apply to the protests, as there has been no rebellion or insurrection. The state argues that the use of National Guard forces has stoked fear and heightened tensions, asserting that local police have effectively managed any violence at the protests. The lawsuit underscores the conflict between state and federal authority in managing civil unrest.</p>

          <p>U.S. and China are set to continue trade talks in London, as the world's top two economies seek to resolve differences following a call between their leaders. President Trump's top trade officials met their Chinese counterparts, with Trump authorizing the removal of U.S. restrictions on the sales of chipmaking software, jet engine parts, and ethane. Trump said that the talks were progressing well and he was "only getting good reports." China's Foreign Ministry confirmed Vice Premier He Lifeng's presence in the U.K. for the talks.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was necessary for a "golden age of clean energy." However, Alison Downes, director of Stop Sizewell C, criticized the cost and incomplete negotiations with private investors. The government insists nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030.</p>

A report by the Women and Equalities Committee states that paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes" and require bold action, necessitating significant investment. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach. Introduced in 2003, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving £187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower.</p>
