            <p>TSMC's first-quarter profit surpassed expectations due to high demand for AI chips, with net income rising 60.3% year-over-year to NT$361.56 billion. The high-performance computing division, including AI and 5G applications, significantly contributed to sales. However, potential headwinds arise from President Trump's trade policy, including tariffs on Taiwan and export controls on TSMC clients like Nvidia and AMD. TSMC is investing heavily in overseas facilities, including an additional $100 billion in the U.S., in response to these trade concerns, and AMD and Nvidia have announced plans to manufacture chips at TSMC's Arizona facilities.

The new guidelines will impact areas like hospital wards, changing rooms, and women's sports, clarifying that individuals born male but identifying as female do not automatically have the right to use women-only spaces, including those with GRCs.</p>

            <p>A prominent Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) official has been found to have violated the organization's ethics code after an investigation revealed inappropriate behavior at a social event. The official, identified as 'AB', reportedly spent an excessive amount of time with a volunteer of the opposite sex, causing discomfort among witnesses who feared it could damage the reputation of the CGF. Despite the official's denial of any wrongdoing, the ethics commission chair concluded that the actions created the appearance of impropriety and could bring the Commonwealth Games into disrepute.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has requested a delay in the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing pending a review of a recently completed parole board risk assessment. This request follows a judge's denial of the DA's motion to withdraw a previous motion that favored reducing the brothers' sentences. The DA argues that the court should have the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions, while the brothers' attorney claims that justice won over politics in the judge's ruling.</p>

Officials estimate that 90% of clients will have electricity restored within 48 to 72 hours, and the governor has pledged to investigate the cause of the shutdown and find potential replacements for Luma.</p>

Miller acknowledged his performance was below his potential and attributed his struggles to inconsistent execution with his slider and changeup, leaving the Dodgers with questions about their pitching depth.</p>

The article suggests that any US trade deal should be viewed tactically, not strategically, and should not overshadow the importance of trade relations with Europe for the UK's economic growth.</p>
