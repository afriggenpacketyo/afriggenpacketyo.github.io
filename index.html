          <p>Moodyâ€™s Investors Service downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over rising levels of government debt and a widening budget deficit. The agency criticized U.S. politicians for failing to address the country's fiscal challenges, expecting the budget deficit to keep rising due to increasing entitlement spending. While some investors anticipate a limited market impact, the downgrade may lead to higher yields on U.S. Treasuries as investors become more cautious. Despite the downgrade, some investors point out that the U.S. issues debt in its own currency and cannot technically default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how Donald Trump's policies are eroding U.S. soft power, which was once a key advantage in its rivalry with China. Actions such as attacks on academic freedom, cuts to federal research grants, and authoritarian tendencies are undermining the rule of law and tarnishing the U.S.'s image as a democratic exemplar. The author argues that these actions are shifting the balance of international attraction in Beijing's favor, as the U.S. compromises its ability to attract and retain global talent. </p>

The article asserts that the Hall of Fame should honor greatness, not character, and that Rose's actions did not affect game outcomes, unlike the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The author concludes that it's time to put the Hit King in Cooperstown, regardless of the opinions of baseball purists. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump is proceeding with constructing a new section of border wall in a remote area of Arizona's San Rafael Valley, threatening wildlife migration. Despite low levels of human crossings, the wall will sever a critical wildlife corridor used by various animals, including bears, mountain lions, and jaguars. Critics argue the project is an expensive, unnecessary, and environmentally disastrous project. The wall can cost up to $30m per mile.

          <p>Israel indicated its willingness to consider a deal with Hamas that includes "ending the fighting" in Gaza, amidst intensified military operations. Prime Minister Netanyahu's office stated that negotiations in Doha are aimed at exhausting every possibility for a deal involving the release of hostages, exile of Hamas terrorists, and disarmament of Gaza. Meanwhile, reports emerged of dozens killed in an attack on displaced Palestinians in Al-Mawasi, raising concerns about worsening humanitarian conditions. UN chief Guterres called for a permanent ceasefire, and protests in Tel Aviv demanded a hostage release deal. </p>

          <h2>RSV Hospitalizations in Babies Drop Dramatically Due to New Vaccines and Treatments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study reveals a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies, linked to the widespread availability of vaccines for pregnant women and monoclonal antibody treatments for infants. Hospitalizations in babies under seven months decreased by as much as 56%, while newborns saw a reduction of up to 71%. This trend was noted by emergency physicians, who observed fewer critically ill children from RSV this year. Research suggests spiritual development is associated with protection against depression and substance abuse, and with setting young adults up for healthier relationships, more purposeful work, and greater emotional resilience. </p>

          <p>The author warns that the current pause in Donald Trump's trade war with China will be brief, urging small businesses to prepare accordingly. Despite the pause, existing tariffs remain in place, resulting in an effective tariff rate of around 40% on Chinese goods. The author advises businesses to use the suspension to stock up on products, find alternative suppliers, or bring assembly and manufacturing back to the US. The author notes that Trump's past actions and animosity towards China suggest that the trade war will likely resume, creating continued uncertainty for businesses. </p>

Trump has declared eight emergencies in his second term's first 100 days, far exceeding previous presidents. These declarations unlock special powers that allow him to bypass Congress and implement policies, often related to the border, energy, and trade. Critics question whether these situations meet the legal standard for an emergency, raising concerns about the abuse of presidential power. </p>
