          <p>US President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently claimed a link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and increased autism rates, advising women against it. This assertion is strongly challenged by the scientific community, which states that extensive research shows no causal effect, only a minimal risk increase, and that autism is a complex disorder with polygenetic and environmental influences. Experts also note that the rise in diagnoses is primarily due to broader diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, not a Tylenol-autism connection. Major medical groups continue to recommend acetaminophen as a safe pain reliever for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade pact, the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), after over nine years of negotiations, a process expedited by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The deal aims to eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and pharmaceuticals, while opening investment in sectors such as electric vehicles. This agreement is expected to boost jobs and growth for both parties, securing critical raw materials for Europe and providing Indonesia wider access to the EU market. Officials estimate EU exporters will save approximately €600 million annually in duties.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed that its factory production will remain suspended until at least October 1st, following a cyber attack in late August that forced a shutdown of its IT networks. The prolonged disruption raises concerns for JLR's suppliers, with fears that some could face financial collapse without support. Government officials, including the business secretary, are visiting JLR to meet with the company and its supply chain partners to offer assistance and help restore operations. The company acknowledges the difficult period for all involved and thanks stakeholders for their continued patience.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish renewables company Orsted surged by 6.6% after a U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction, allowing the firm to resume construction of its Revolution Wind project. This offshore wind farm, located off Rhode Island and Connecticut, had been halted by the Trump administration's policy against such projects. The court's decision represents a significant victory for Orsted, which has been negatively impacted by the administration's stance on wind power. The company plans to restart work on the nearly completed project as soon as possible, providing a reprieve for the embattled firm.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service has launched "Jess's Rule," a new initiative urging general practitioners to re-evaluate diagnoses if a patient presents with worsening or undiagnosed symptoms after three appointments. Named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced cancer at 27 after repeated misdiagnoses, the rule aims to prevent avoidable deaths by promoting earlier specialist referrals or additional tests. Health Secretary Wes Streeting called her death a "preventable tragedy," emphasizing the rule's potential to improve patient safety. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports this best practice approach, especially for younger patients and ethnic minorities who often face diagnostic delays.</p>

This controversial draft constitution, supported by General Mamady Doumbouya's military government, would allow military members to seek office and extend presidential terms to seven years. Opposition leaders, including former President Alpha Conde, called for a boycott, with their parties currently suspended. Critics, including the UN Human Rights Office, have raised concerns about the vote's inclusiveness and transparency amid a crackdown on opposition.

Tylenol maker Kenvue also denied any causal link, warning of health risks if women avoid the medication.

          <h2>BBC Investigation Exposes Widespread Premier League Ticket Touting and Fraud</h2>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed an industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, with Brighton & Hove Albion demonstrating how touted resales affect fans. One fan traveled 5,500 miles from South Korea, paid £900 for a ticket from an unauthorized website, and was denied entry because the ticket was deactivated. Reselling tickets is illegal in the UK, but many offshore websites use bots and fake identities to acquire and resell tickets at inflated prices, often leaving fans out of pocket. Brighton is combating this with new technology and a dedicated investigation officer, blocking hundreds of fraudulent tickets and saving fans significant money.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Representative Adam Smith, leading a bipartisan delegation to Beijing, emphasized the critical need for greater communication between the U.S. and Chinese militaries, especially given China's rising strength and nuclear arsenal. Smith warned that a lack of regular dialogue on capabilities and intentions is dangerous, increasing the risk of miscalculations and misunderstandings that could lead to larger problems. He highlighted rapid advancements in AI and cyberspace as amplifying these risks. Smith urged China to engage more with other large militaries for "basic deconfliction," stressing that even as Beijing downplays its nuclear strength, a conversation about it is essential.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to UCLA, which had been frozen over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to provide specific explanations for the cuts. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million to UCLA from the National Science Foundation. The administration had sought a $1 billion payment from UCLA to settle its investigation, which California Governor Gavin Newsom called an extortion attempt.</p>

          <p>Modern Premier League football is increasingly adopting tactics long championed by manager Sam Allardyce, often criticized in his time. Coaches are now emphasizing set-pieces, direct long passes, and utilizing large strikers, moving away from strict possession-based play. Allardyce, who guided teams like Bolton to success with these methods, notes a shift away from the "pandemic" of playing out from the back due to the risks of losing possession in one's own half. He also highlights the growing importance of set-piece coaches and strategic innovation. Allardyce encourages young coaches to be different and embrace tactics that surprise opponents.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs have requested a lenient sentence of no more than 14 months for his two prostitution-related convictions, arguing he has already been sufficiently punished. Combs, facing an October 3rd sentencing, was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges. His defense claims his celebrity status and legacy are shattered, and his life systematically dismantled, with over 100 employees laid off and his children facing "devastating consequences." The lawyers described Combs' 13 months in prison as harrowing, but also transformative, leading to sobriety and efforts to teach business skills to other inmates.</p>
