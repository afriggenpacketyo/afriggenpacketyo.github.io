          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has announced that most American travelers will no longer need to remove their shoes during airport security screenings, ending a post-9/11 ritual. This policy change reflects significant progress in security technology, particularly the rollout of advanced 3D CT scanners that can reliably detect explosives. The article frames this development as a marker of a broader decline in the threat of large-scale terrorism in the West, even while acknowledging that new threats from domestic extremism and civil liberties concerns about surveillance persist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A surge in unregulated rare earth mining in Myanmar, driven by global demand and stricter environmental laws in China, is causing a major environmental crisis. Rivers flowing into Thailand, such as the Kok and Sai, are now heavily contaminated with arsenic and other toxic metals, rendering them unsafe for local communities who rely on them for water and livelihood. Activists blame the United Wa State Army (UWSA), a powerful ethnic militia controlling the region, for the pollution and are urging China, a key buyer of the minerals, to intervene and promote responsible mining practices to prevent a worsening catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams are continuing an extensive search for over 170 people still missing after catastrophic flash floods devastated Central Texas's Hill Country. The death toll has risen to at least 122, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, including at least 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic on the Guadalupe River. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, and officials are now facing scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and the lack of a public alert system in the flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>This article explains the key factors that led to the deadly flash floods in Texas, which claimed over 122 lives. A combination of the region's flood-prone geography, moisture from a tropical system, and a stationary weather pattern caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The disaster, which heavily impacted summer camps like Camp Mystic, has sparked intense scrutiny over why residents were not warned or evacuated sooner. Officials have defended their actions, citing the unprecedented nature of the flood and public resistance to the cost of a better warning system.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing a new round of funding for Ukraine, a potential policy shift that could be a message to Russia following its recent intense aerial attacks. Despite his previous criticism of U.S. spending on the conflict, Trump has hinted at sending more defensive weapons, potentially using leftover presidential drawdown authority or seized Russian assets. This move comes as the administration continues to press European NATO allies to increase their own contributions, suggesting a new mechanism where NATO would purchase U.S.-made equipment to transfer to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>This article argues that modern society overly restricts children's movement, hindering their physical and cognitive development. It contrasts the sedentary lives of many kids with the natural, "wild" play of young animals, suggesting that free play is essential for building healthier bones, better cognitive skills, and mental well-being. The author, citing injury-prevention experts, posits that preventing children from engaging in activities like climbing trees or running down slopes out of fear of injury can be counterproductive. Such experiences are crucial for developing a robust "movement vocabulary" that makes them more resilient and less prone to injury later in life.</p>

Tassin advises women to conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to understand their true financial impact and then experimenting with opting out to reclaim money, time, and mental energy for goals like debt repayment and investing.

          <p>Conservationists are raising alarms over a decline in the osprey population around the Chesapeake Bay, a key habitat for the iconic raptor. Biologist Bryan Watts has documented that osprey chicks are starving in their nests because they are not getting enough menhaden, a nutrient-rich fish that is a critical part of their diet. This trend threatens to reverse the bird's successful recovery after being nearly wiped out by DDT. The fishing industry, which heavily harvests menhaden, disputes the claim, but regulators are now considering new management approaches to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Relatives of those killed in last month's Air India crash in Ahmedabad, which killed 260 people on the plane and on the ground, are seeking more answers after the release of a preliminary investigative report. The report stated that fuel to the engines was cut off seconds after takeoff but did not explain why, leaving families with more questions than answers. In the cockpit voice recording, one pilot is heard asking the other why the fuel was cut, to which the other replied he did not do it. Grieving family members expressed frustration, calling the report vague and hoping the final investigation provides clarity.</p>

          <h2>Finance and STEM Majors May Not Offer the Best Job Prospects, New Data Suggests</h2>

          <p>While many college students believe a finance degree offers the best career prospects, recent data on employment rates suggests otherwise. A survey by the CFA Institute found high student confidence in finance, but data from the New York Fed shows that recent graduates in fields like art history and nutritional sciences have lower unemployment rates. Furthermore, majors such as theology and philosophy have better employment outcomes than economics. This trend is partly fueled by the rise of AI, which is increasing demand for humanities graduates with creative thinking and other "soft skills" that are harder to automate.

          <p>This article provides an overview of what scientists currently understand about black holes, the enigmatic cosmic phenomena whose immense gravity can puncture spacetime. Astrophysicists explain that black holes are not cosmic vacuum cleaners but are essential to the formation of galaxies, a relatively new understanding confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope. The article also touches on the different types of black holes, the theory that some form from collapsed gas clouds, and the unsettling concept of "spaghettification" for anything that falls past their event horizon.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film has become a target in the culture wars, with critics decrying it as "superwoke" because director James Gunn acknowledged the character's immigrant story. This article argues the backlash is overblown, as Superman has always been an immigrant from the planet Krypton, a fact often referenced in past media. The film itself tells a story of assimilation and heartland values, where Clark Kent's heroism comes from his Kansas upbringing, not his alien origins. The author suggests the character has never been politically radical and that the current debate ignores the story's core themes of kindness and choice.</p>

Through installations like a series of bus stops depicting past, present, and imagined futures, the exhibition aims to engage visitors emotionally and intellectually.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in several California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling sides with advocacy groups who argued that federal agents were using unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests, particularly in Latino communities. The judge found that "roving patrols" without reasonable suspicion are unconstitutional. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, stating its agents will continue to enforce the law while abiding by the Constitution.</p>
