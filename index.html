          <h2>Trump Proposes Shift to Semi-Annual Corporate Earnings Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 10:07:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports to encourage a greater focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. This idea, which would require SEC approval, mirrors practices in the U.K. and European Union and has been previously supported by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. Supporters of the current quarterly system argue it provides essential transparency and timely information for investors, highlighting that U.S. reporting standards are considered among the world's most reliable. The proposal aims to align corporate management with a longer-term vision, similar to what Trump inaccurately attributes to Chinese corporate planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack has compromised the personal data of customers of luxury fashion brands including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen. The hacker group, known as Shiny Hunters, stole information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and total purchase amounts, but parent company Kering confirmed no financial details were accessed. The breach is concerning as the stolen data on high-spending clients could be used for targeted secondary scams. Kering has notified the relevant data protection authorities and affected customers but has not made a public announcement about the full scale of the incident.</p>

The couple, who first met in 1991 but only began their romance in 2020, confirmed the news ahead of the Primetime Emmy Awards. McEntire had previously expressed that while she had lost some faith in the institution of marriage after two divorces, she was deeply committed to Linn and would be open to marrying him. Their relationship deepened through remote communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, which they credit for building a strong, intimate foundation.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that a 'framework' deal has been reached concerning the future of TikTok, with commercial terms agreed upon between the private parties involved. The agreement, which could shift the popular social media platform to U.S.-controlled ownership, is set to be finalized in a discussion between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes amid a looming deadline for parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns raised by Congress. The deal aims to resolve a protracted standoff that has seen Trump issue multiple extensions to avoid a shutdown of the app in the United States.</p>

          <p>Despite geopolitical tensions and other challenges, there are signs of a rekindled interest among younger Europeans in pursuing careers and educational opportunities in China. This trend comes more than two years after strict COVID-19 policies led to a significant departure of foreigners from the country. Many young professionals and students view China as a hub of rapid growth and potential, particularly in fields like technology and entrepreneurship.

          <h2>Sabrina Carpenter's Music Reflects Gen Z's Dating Frustrations and Gender Divide</h2>

          <p>An opinion article posits that Sabrina Carpenter's album "Man’s Best Friend" serves as a cultural marker for the growing disillusionment among Gen Z women with dating and relationships. The lyrics are said to capture the exasperation with emotionally unprepared partners, a sentiment reflected in data showing more single young women are opting out of dating compared to men. The piece explores how this trend connects to a wider gender divergence, the influence of the 'manosphere,' and the decline in men's emotional support networks outside of romantic partners. Carpenter's work is presented as a sharp commentary on these contemporary gender power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Following an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, mortgage experts advise prospective homebuyers to act promptly but with discipline to capitalize on improved market conditions. Key recommendations include getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, comparing offers from various lenders, and strategically locking in the best rate quickly. Experts caution against assuming rates will continue to fall or overextending one's budget, as a lower rate might qualify a buyer for a larger loan than they can comfortably afford. The article stresses that while a rate cut often spurs a competitive market, thorough financial assessment and property review remain crucial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The watermelon has become a potent symbol of Palestinian protest and identity, largely because its colors—red, green, black, and white—mirror those of the Palestinian flag. Its use as a political statement originated after the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in the occupied territories. According to artist Sliman Mansour, an Israeli officer once warned that even a painting of a watermelon would be confiscated if it used the flag's colors, inadvertently cementing its symbolic status. Today, the watermelon emoji and image are widely used globally in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and on social media to express solidarity.</p>

          <p>While a majority of job seekers now use AI in their application process, career experts caution against over-reliance on these tools, which could harm their chances. A significant issue is that AI tools can "hallucinate" or fabricate information to align a resume with a job description, leading to inaccuracies that candidates cannot defend in an interview. Additionally, AI-generated applications often lack authenticity and share a uniform structure, making them less likely to stand out to recruiters. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial generation, and always proofreading carefully to avoid embarrassing and costly errors.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man, Ryder Corral, has been arrested in Phoenix, Arizona, for allegedly vandalizing a memorial dedicated to Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was recently killed in Utah. Witnesses reported seeing the man damaging flowers and other items left at the memorial outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA. Corral is now facing charges of criminal damage and disorderly conduct. The incident adds another layer of tension to the aftermath of Kirk's death, which has already sparked intense political division and debate across the country.</p>

          <p>Christian Brueckner, the primary suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has refused to be interviewed by British police just days before his scheduled release from a German prison. Brueckner, a convicted sex offender, is completing a sentence for a separate crime and has never been charged in the McCann case, consistently denying any involvement. His refusal is a significant setback for the long-running investigation, as authorities had hoped to question him about his movements in Portugal at the time the three-year-old vanished. German prosecutors are now seeking supervisory oversight, similar to parole, to monitor Brueckner upon his release.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will take "resolute countermeasures" if the United States imposes threatened tariffs related to Beijing's trade in Russian oil. A foreign ministry spokesman described the potential U.S. actions as "unilateral bullying and economic coercion," asserting that China's energy cooperation with Russia is legitimate and should not be subject to interference. The statement underscores the escalating economic and geopolitical tensions between the two global powers. Beijing firmly rejected what it called illegal unilateral sanctions, warning that such moves undermine international trade rules and threaten global supply chain stability.</p>

          <p>Manchester City secured a decisive 3-0 victory over Manchester United by tactically exploiting weaknesses in their rival's defensive system. City manager Pep Guardiola focused attacks down the left flank, using clever positioning and player rotations to create a midfield overload that United's defense struggled to contain. The analysis highlights how City's players 'pinned' United's defenders, creating space for attackers like Jeremy Doku to drive forward and create scoring opportunities. The article explores whether United's struggles are due to personnel or a flawed system, concluding that while better players always help, opponents have found consistent ways to unpick manager Ruben Amorim's tactics.</p>

          <p>Three years after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's morality police, the country is facing a tense atmosphere marked by severe economic hardship and continued political repression. The 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement she inspired has had a lasting impact, with many women now openly defying the mandatory hijab law. However, analysts are skeptical that another mass protest movement is imminent, as recent military conflicts and a brutal government crackdown have shifted public focus toward survival. Any future unrest is likely to be driven by the deepening economic crisis, which has been exacerbated by international sanctions and conflict.</p>

          <p>In local elections held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party nearly tripled its result from five years ago, making it the clear winner in terms of percentage gains. While the conservative CDU remained the strongest party, the results were a significant blow to the environmentalist Greens and the center-left SPD. The AfD's strong performance, particularly in former SPD strongholds like Gelsenkirchen, is being interpreted as a protest vote against the current federal government and a reflection of public anxiety over issues like migration and the economy, signaling a continuing rightward shift in the German electorate.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk serves as a stark warning about the nature of modern nationalism, particularly in the United States. The author contrasts America's deeply personal and grievance-based nationalism, which erodes compromise, with China's more structured and collective form of patriotism. The article suggests that the volatile aftermath of Kirk's death reveals a society where political identity has become existential. This form of nationalism, amplified by social media, turns individuals into ideological warriors and makes political conflicts more dangerous and irreconcilable.</p>

          <p>A data analysis shows that African nations are increasingly vital to the global supply of critical minerals like cobalt, platinum, and manganese, which are essential for green energy and technology. The International Monetary Fund estimates this resource wealth could boost sub-Saharan Africa's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years. However, the continent faces significant challenges in capitalizing on this boom, including fragile governance, environmental degradation, and inequitable revenue sharing. To fully benefit, experts argue that African countries must move beyond raw material extraction and develop domestic refining capabilities to capture more value.</p>

His work, which angered Pyongyang, was considered a vital source of outside information for many North Koreans and inspired numerous others who later defected.

          <p>While rich in critical minerals, many African nations find that the global race to extract these resources is fueling instability rather than prosperity. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, disputes over valuable coltan mines have exacerbated a three-decade-long conflict, with armed groups smuggling the mineral to fund their operations. This illicit trade contaminates global supply chains and undermines efforts for responsible sourcing. The political instability in the Sahel region has also caused investors to flee, further demonstrating how the mineral boom can be a curse, contributing to conflict and exploitation rather than sustainable development.</p>
