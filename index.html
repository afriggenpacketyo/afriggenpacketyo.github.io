          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. This positive result occurred despite challenges from a strong euro impacting its U.S. dollar-denominated business and mixed performance in its investment banking division. The bank's leadership expressed confidence in meeting full-year targets, citing strong business momentum and cost discipline, even as corporate loan growth remains sluggish amid market uncertainty.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 03:15:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing an unusual oversupply problem within its waste-to-energy sector, with a surplus of incineration capacity and not enough municipal waste to burn. Since 2019, incineration capacity has more than doubled while the generation of solid waste has only increased by about 11%, leading to an estimated 40% of capacity sitting idle. Experts attribute this imbalance to an economic downturn and slowing urbanization, which have tempered the growth of waste production, challenging the industry's optimistic planning.</p>

A rescue helicopter spotted the burning fuselage, and emergency services are currently en route to the crash site. The flight originated in Blagoveshchensk, near the Chinese border.</p>

          <p>China is aiming to strengthen its relationship with Nepal by advancing the trans-Himalayan connectivity network and increasing investment in key sectors like agriculture, new energy, and health. This initiative comes as Beijing competes with New Delhi for influence in the strategically located nation, which has traditionally been a close ally of India. In recent years, China has significantly increased its economic engagement with Nepal through substantial investments in infrastructure projects, from roads to hydropower plants, drawing the Himalayan country closer.</p>

The deal aims to cut tariffs on goods like British whisky and cars and Indian textiles, boosting bilateral trade, which totaled £42.6 billion last year. While hailed by both leaders as a major achievement that will create jobs and drive growth, the agreement must still be approved by the UK parliament before it can take effect.</p>

          <p>A growing crisis in student mental health is placing immense pressure on UK universities, sparking a debate over the extent of their responsibility. The number of students reporting mental health conditions has nearly quadrupled in a decade, yet many feel that university support services are inadequate or difficult to navigate. While universities have increased investment in wellbeing services, they stress they are not a substitute for clinical NHS treatment. The situation is complicated by under-resourced academic tutors acting as first responders and long NHS waiting times, leaving many students feeling unsupported.</p>

          <p>In a significant departure from presidential norms, Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, escalating his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. Presidents have historically respected the central bank's political independence, but Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and has even suggested he could fire him. This direct visit to the Federal Reserve's headquarters is a powerful symbolic challenge to the institution's autonomy and brings his criticism directly to the chairman's doorstep.

          <p>A high-ranking Department of Justice official is scheduled to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell at the federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida, where she is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The meeting comes after President Trump directed the DOJ to hear any credible information Maxwell might have about crimes committed by others. This development occurs as the House Oversight Committee also issued a subpoena for Maxwell to provide a deposition, indicating continued intense scrutiny of the Jeffrey Epstein case and his network of associates.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by local opposition, a growing number of states are passing laws to force cities and counties to allow for the construction of more affordable housing. In Utah, where the median home price has soared to over $500,000, the state now requires municipalities to adopt strategies for denser, cheaper housing and has strengthened enforcement. This trend reflects a national crisis where homeownership is increasingly out of reach for the middle class, prompting states to override local zoning rules to combat a severe housing shortage and its generational economic consequences.</p>

This finding presents a more achievable goal for many people than the commonly cited but unscientific benchmark of 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found that health benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps for most conditions, encouraging a practical approach to improving daily physical activity.</p>

          <p>An oceanographer from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography was surprised to discover a rare violet sea snail (Janthina janthina) on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically found in the area. These pelagic snails, which float on the open ocean using a bubble raft, are usually found in warmer tropical waters. Their appearance, the first documented by Scripps in a decade, coincided with notably warm offshore water temperatures. This has led researchers to speculate whether the unusual sighting could be linked to climate change and warming ocean conditions.</p>
