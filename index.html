          <p>In a significant policy reversal driven by a potential new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, Germany is planning to build the largest military in Europe. The government intends to amend its constitution and dedicate 3.5% of its GDP to defense, a move that will inject hundreds of billions into its armed forces without cutting social programs. This historic shift aims to meet NATO commitments and reflects a profound change in Germany's post-war identity, though transforming the nation's military culture is expected to take a generation.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the 1972 murder trial of Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt, a Black Panther Party leader who was wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for 27 years. The case, which his lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr. came to see as a conspiracy of official corruption, was built on the testimony of an FBI informant and marred by withheld evidence. Pratt's eventual exoneration in 1997 became a landmark moment for Cochran and exposed the lengths to which law enforcement went to neutralize perceived threats during the COINTELPRO era.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, the U.S. Supreme Court has postponed its ruling on a contentious Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case centers on whether a new map with two majority-Black districts, created to comply with the Voting Rights Act, is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The eventual decision could have profound implications for the future of the Voting Rights Act and the role race can play in drawing electoral maps to protect minority voters' power.</p>

Key successes included a favorable Supreme Court ruling that limits nationwide injunctions against executive actions and diplomatic progress with increased NATO defense spending. However, the administration still faces pressure to finalize numerous trade deals before a looming deadline and to secure the passage of its major "one big beautiful bill" for taxes and policy in the Senate.</p>
