          <p>The European Union is facing significant economic pressure as it contends with trade policies from both the United States and China. The bloc is currently deliberating its response to a proposed 30% tariff on all EU-made goods announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. While France advocates for strong countermeasures, the European Commission is pursuing a temporary suspension of retaliatory actions to allow for negotiations. This complex situation highlights the EU's challenge in maintaining its economic stability and strategic autonomy amidst escalating global trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession, reporting a 1.4% economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, a significant reversal from the previous quarter's contraction. This growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector and a 4.4% increase in construction, beating economists' expectations. Despite this positive performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. The report underscores the nation's economic resilience while acknowledging its vulnerability to international trade volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's trade data for June revealed stronger-than-expected performance, with exports increasing by 5.8% and imports rising by 1.1% year-over-year. The export surge is attributed to businesses rushing shipments to capitalize on a temporary tariff reprieve with the U.S. Notably, this marks the first time this year that imports have grown, signaling a potential rebound in domestic demand. This economic activity occurs as Beijing and Washington work towards an August deadline for a durable trade agreement, following a period of intense tariff exchanges and subsequent negotiations.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following an announcement of a plan to sell U.S. weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Ukraine. This strategy would allow for faster delivery of military aid, such as moving equipment from Germany to Ukraine, rather than waiting for new production from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to enact heavy sanctions against Russia's economy and its international supporters. The developments suggest a potential shift in U.S. strategy to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities more rapidly.</p>

          <p>Warning that Europe's liberty faces its greatest threat since World War Two, French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans for a significant increase in defense spending. He called for the military budget to double by 2027, reaching €64 billion, a goal now accelerated by three years. In a speech to the armed forces, Macron cited complex geopolitics and the threat from Russia's "imperialist policies" as justification for the increase. The proposal reflects a broader trend among NATO allies to bolster their military capabilities in response to a changing global security landscape.</p>

          <p>The Cincinnati community is in shock after Imam Ayman Soliman, a respected former chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, was detained by ICE. His asylum status, which was granted in 2018 after he fled persecution in Egypt, was revoked in June 2025 following a process initiated under the Biden administration. His sudden arrest during a routine check-in has sparked an uproar and raised concerns about due process for non-criminal immigrants. Community members and legal experts are now questioning the circumstances of his case and advocating for his release.</p>

          <p>A violent series of events in Lexington, Kentucky, left three people dead, including the suspect. The incident began when a state trooper was shot and wounded during a traffic stop. The suspect then carjacked a vehicle and fled to Richmond Road Baptist Church, where he fatally shot two individuals, identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32. Two other men were also wounded by the gunman before Lexington police arrived and shot and killed the suspect. Authorities believe the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of the season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory over the San Francisco Giants, solidifying their position with the best record in the National League. Despite a comfortable 5.5-game lead in the NL West, the team's performance has been uneven, marked by an injury-plagued pitching staff and uncharacteristic slumps from key offensive players. While stars like Yoshinobu Yamamoto have been exceptional, issues in the bullpen and inconsistent hitting remain areas for improvement as the team heads toward the trade deadline aiming for a repeat championship.</p>

          <p>The UK's national weather service, the Met Office, has warned that the country's climate is now "notably different" from just a few decades ago, with extreme weather events becoming the new normal. The latest State of the UK Climate report shows that the country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency due to global warming. The UK is warming at a rate of 0.25°C per decade, leading to more very hot days, fewer cold nights, and significantly wetter winters. This shift is impacting the natural world and increasing the risk of severe weather like storms and flooding.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some conservative figures abroad, is facing a significant political challenge from within his own former circle. A new opposition party, led by former Fidesz insider Peter Magyar, is gaining traction by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of hospitals and schools. While Orban has maintained power for years by identifying voter fears and controlling the political narrative, recent polls show his party is now neck-and-neck with the new challenger, suggesting his long-established playbook may be weakening.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is escalating a long-running water dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to Texas, but it is currently in arrears. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs if Mexico does not fulfill its obligations. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot give water they don't have, while Texan farmers accuse them of hoarding water and using inefficient irrigation, threatening their own agricultural survival.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the Trump administration's new 50% tariff on Brazil, stating it is part of a comprehensive strategy to onshore production and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. When questioned about imposing tariffs on a country with which the U.S. has a trade surplus, Hassett argued that an overall strategy is necessary to prevent transshipping and achieve long-term objectives. The administration maintains that such tariffs are a tool to address national security risks by ensuring domestic production capacity for critical materials in an emergency.
