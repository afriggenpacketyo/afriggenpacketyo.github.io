          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to meet with airline leaders to reduce flights at Newark Liberty International Airport after a series of technological and staffing issues caused major delays and cancellations. Duffy acknowledged that the country has not paid enough attention to improving antiquated systems across major airports and warned that similar disruptions could occur at other airports nationwide as the summer travel season approaches. Despite the problems, Duffy assured travelers that the airspace remains safe, citing backups and alternative procedures in place, and that he and his family continue to travel through the airport. He is seeking congressional approval for a multibillion-dollar proposal to modernize the air traffic control system, including digitizing flight data management tools and upgrading radio systems.</p>

          <p>A counter-extremism expert, Ghaffar Hussain, advocates for the segregation of Islamist extremists from other prisoners in British jails to prevent violence and the spread of extremist ideologies. Hussain's comments follow a violent attack on officers by the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber and highlight concerns about the under-utilization of existing separation units. He suggests that Britain should adopt strategies used in countries like France, Spain, and the Netherlands, where extremist prisoners are often separated to improve prison safety and enable more effective counter-radicalization efforts. Hussain argues that the current system risks turning prisons into incubators of extremism.</p>

While the domestic intelligence service has classified the AfD as "confirmed right-wing extremist," a court ruling has temporarily suspended this classification.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is advocating for an immediate truce, while President Trump has questioned the willingness of both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a deal. Putin has proposed direct talks in Turkey, but Zelenskyy insists on a ceasefire first. The US has aligned with Russia on a UN vote regarding the war, while European leaders have set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day ceasefire or face additional sanctions. Macron described Putin's offer of direct talks as insufficient, indicating continued Western skepticism.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry’s recent emotional plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, potentially undermining the monarchy’s attempts to model unity. Harry's comments, made in a BBC interview, followed a legal defeat over his security arrangements in Britain, drawing attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan, withdrew from royal life. Some royal watchers suggest that unless Charles can find a way to heal the rift, it could define his reign and undercut messages of tolerance and inclusiveness. Meanwhile, Prince William has taken on a more prominent public role amid his father's illness and his brother's estrangement.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest's manager Nuno Espirito Santo stated that his side's bid to qualify for the Champions League is "not finished" despite a damaging home draw against already-relegated Leicester. The team remains seventh, trailing behind Chelsea and Aston Villa, as the results of the weekend games mean that only four points separate Newcastle in third and Forest in seventh with two rounds of fixtures remaining. Chelsea's chances were also dented as they were beaten 2-0 at Newcastle. The article also indicates that the Forest's match against Chelsea on the last day of the season increasingly looks like it could determine which of the two sides finishes in the top five.</p>

          <p>A fourth round of nuclear talks between the US and Iran in Oman concluded with both sides agreeing to meet again. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff described the discussions as encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called them "difficult but useful". The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment program, while Tehran denies it has such an aim and reiterated it would not give up the program. The article mentions the talks took place in the same week that Witkoff said the US expects Iran to dismantle its uranium enrichment activities.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned chess indefinitely due to concerns that the game is a source of gambling, with officials saying the game has been prohibited until its compatibility with Islamic law can be determined. This action follows the Taliban's broader restrictions on sports, particularly for women, as they steadily impose laws reflecting their strict interpretation of Islamic law. One cafe owner in Kabul, who has hosted chess competitions, expressed respect for the decision but noted it would negatively impact his business, as chess provided a popular activity for young people.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from Qatar’s royal family for use as Air Force One, sparking accusations of bribery and corruption. The jet, valued at approximately $400 million, would be transferred to his presidential library foundation at the end of his second term. While Trump’s attorneys claim the gift is legally permissible, critics argue it violates the Constitution's Emoluments Clause and constitutes bribery. The move has also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given the Trump Organization's business dealings in Qatar.</p>

          <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch featuring a flirty waiter and two middle-aged moms fell short of challenging stereotypes about motherhood and sexuality, instead reinforcing the idea that older women are undesirable and sexless. The skit, while intending to push back against these stereotypes, ultimately relied on humor that implied it was ridiculous for a younger man to be genuinely attracted to older moms. This missed opportunity to present a more expansive and refreshing view of motherhood was compounded by a "Weekend Update" segment that further linked motherhood with a lack of sexuality.</p>
