          <p>Macy's reported robust fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by revamped stores that boosted sales trends. The department store operator also raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, signaling cautious optimism despite ongoing tariff impacts. CEO Tony Spring emphasized the company's strong market position, aiming to gain share and enhance customer experience with a newer assortment and healthy inventory. This positive financial update, including strong comparable sales growth across all three nameplates like Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reflects a strategic lean into successful business segments such as denim and women's contemporary apparel.

          <p>Alphabet's stock surged 7% after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in Google's antitrust case. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the court rejected demands to divest its Chrome browser or prohibit payments for default search engine status. This decision is viewed as a significant win for Google, removing a major regulatory overhang and bolstering confidence in the long-term durability of its search business. Analysts now anticipate increased stability and growth for Alphabet, especially as Google continues to pin its artificial intelligence hopes on its Gemini suite of AI models and chatbot.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields remained largely unchanged, with the 30-year bond briefly touching the 5% mark, as markets reacted to evolving trade policy and budget deficits. A federal appeals court ruling declared most of President Trump's new tariffs illegal, potentially forcing billions in refunds and adding to market jitters. Concerns over Federal Reserve independence also contributed to bond market moves, following attempts to dismiss Governor Lisa Cook and warnings from economists. Investors worry that political interference could lower short-term rates but raise longer rates, impacting the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility ahead of key jobs data.

Additionally, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and currency movements significantly impact gold's value, making it a dynamic investment.

          <p>A new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility, dubbed "Louisiana Lockup," has opened at the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola prison, to house "the worst of the worst" criminal illegal migrants. Fifty-one individuals have already been transferred to the facility, an unused section called Camp J, previously known as the "Dungeon." The Department of Homeland Security is partnering with Louisiana to expand detention space by 416 beds, utilizing funding from the "One Big Beautiful Bill" to ramp up deportations. This initiative is part of President Trump’s broader immigration enforcement expansion, which includes similar facilities in other states.</p>

          <p>A theft charge against Parviz Jafari, accused of stealing flowers from tributes to Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham, has been dropped by prosecutors. The decision came after a court was informed that a security guard had granted the 45-year-old permission to take the flowers. Mr. Jafari, from West Bromwich, was told he was free to go during a brief hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic prospect of conviction, as dishonesty could not be proven. Thousands of tributes had been left near the Black Sabbath bench and mural following Osbourne's death on July 22, aged 76.</p>

          <p>Families of victims from two fatal Boeing 737 Max crashes are making a final plea to a federal judge to reject a Justice Department motion to dismiss a felony charge against Boeing. Prosecutors initially charged Boeing with conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes that killed 346 people. Despite a previous plea agreement being rejected, the DOJ and Boeing renegotiated a non-prosecution agreement, which victims' families argue denies justice and accountability. They seek a public trial and prosecution of former Boeing executives, emphasizing that victims "can't be bought."</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving depiction of children in art throughout history, from their roles in royal marriage politics to religious iconography and eventually as subjects of individual portraits. Art historian Katrin Dyballa highlights how children were initially presented as miniature adults or symbolic figures, with the affluent bourgeoisie later commissioning opulent Baroque-style portraits. The perception of peasant children also shifted, from ridicule to models of humility. The advent of photography further transformed their portrayal, making images more spontaneous, while modern concerns now address children's right to their own image in the digital age. The exhibition "Kids! Between Representation and Reality" will further explore this topic.</p>
