          <p>The Scottish National Party (SNP) is demonstrating a significant political recovery after a period of turmoil that saw its parliamentary representation plummet and its leadership change three times in a year. Under First Minister John Swinney, the party has stabilized, and recent polling suggests it could be on track to win a majority in the Scottish Parliament. This potential victory is crucial for the SNP's goal of securing another independence referendum, as it would mirror the precedent set before the 2014 vote.</p>

          <p>A husband and wife from Middletown, Rhode Island, were killed when their small plane crashed onto Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The single-engine aircraft, which had departed from New Bedford Regional Airport, went down in the highway median and burst into flames. A driver on the highway sustained non-life-threatening injuries after being struck by a piece of the aircraft.

          <p>Northern Ireland's manager, Michael O'Neill, expressed frustration with the match officials after his team's 1-0 defeat to Germany in a World Cup qualifier. O'Neill criticized the referee for being "over fussy" and for adding only two minutes of injury time despite numerous substitutions and stoppages. The lone goal came from Germany's Nick Woltemade, which O'Neill described as a "freak goal" that should have been defended better. The loss leaves Northern Ireland third in their qualifying group.</p>

          <p>The term "Abraham Accords" is being prominently used in Middle East peace negotiations, referencing the biblical patriarch revered by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This shared heritage makes Abraham a powerful symbol for unity, invoked to build bridges between the Jewish state of Israel and majority-Muslim Arab nations. However, the legacy of Abraham can also be a source of division, as different faiths have historically claimed to be his true heirs. The diplomatic term aims to emphasize common ground to foster a shared legacy of peace.</p>

The subsidies, which have saved many families hundreds of dollars per month, are a central point of contention in the current US government shutdown debate.

          <h2>A-10 Warthog Aircraft Reportedly Used to Shoot Down Drones in Middle East</h2>

          <p>An A-10C Warthog aircraft from the Idaho Air National Guard has returned from a deployment in the Middle East with markings indicating it successfully shot down two drones. This suggests the attack jet is now operationally using laser-guided rockets, specifically the Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System II (APKWS II), in an air-to-air capacity against unmanned aerial systems. This new role as a drone killer offers a cost-effective alternative to expensive air-to-air missiles and comes as the venerable A-10 aircraft approaches its planned retirement.</p>

          <p>The Big Ten conference has fined the University of Southern California (USC) $5,000 for violating rules regarding pregame availability reports. The fine was issued after USC played sophomore running back Bryan Jackson, who was listed as "out" before the game against Michigan. Coach Lincoln Riley described the decision as a "wellness issue" made out of necessity after two other running backs suffered serious injuries during the game. The conference stated that availability reports must be accurate and admonished teams against using the "out" designation improperly.</p>

          <h2>Florida Matriarch Convicted in Murder-for-Hire Killing of Former Son-in-Law</h2>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2014 killing of her former son-in-law, Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel. Prosecutors successfully argued that Adelson orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot because Markel was preventing her daughter from moving with their two children to South Florida after a contentious divorce. Adelson is the fifth person to be convicted in the case, which has drawn national attention for its details of family conflict and contract killing.</p>
