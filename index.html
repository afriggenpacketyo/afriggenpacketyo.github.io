          <h2>Report Finds Baby Food Pouches Lack Key Nutrients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 01:00:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation revealed that many baby food pouches from leading UK brands are low in essential nutrients like vitamin C and iron, and some contain excessive sugar. Experts caution that these pouches should not replace homemade meals and can cause health problems if used as the main source of nutrition. While brands claim their products are intended as complementary to a varied diet, the report highlights misleading marketing tactics, such as labeling pouches with "no added sugar" despite high levels of free sugars from blended fruit. The investigation also found some pouches marketed to babies as young as four months, against NHS and WHO recommendations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department for Education in England plans to reduce the number of compulsory branded school uniform items to three, aiming to save families money. The new rule, part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, could affect over four million pupils. While the government estimates savings of around Â£50 per child, uniform retailers warn that generic garments may be lower quality and require more frequent replacement. A uniform exchange volunteer expressed concern that some schools' policies will remain too strict even after the logo limits are enforced, as some schools require a specific skirt style from a specific supplier.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines has forced carriers to reroute flights, increasing flight times and costs for travel between India and Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Some flights may require refueling stops or cancellations, particularly affecting routes to Almaty and Tashkent, which have been temporarily suspended. Air India stated that some of its flights to or from North America, Europe and the Middle East will take an alternative extended route. The airspace closure follows escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. Despite the disruptions, analysts suggest airfares may not significantly increase, but a similar closure in 2019 cost airlines millions.</p>

          <p>North Korea has confirmed it deployed troops to Russia to aid in the war against Ukraine, stating their mission was to help Russia reclaim the Kursk region, which Ukrainian forces had seized. The North Korean leader Kim Jong Un decided to send combat troops to Russia under a mutual defense treaty signed by him and Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2024. Kim stated that the deployment was meant to "annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces." South Korea has urged North Korea to withdraw its troops immediately, calling the deployment a grave provocation to international security.</p>

The felling of the tree caused widespread dismay, and the trial is being closely watched due to the rarity of criminal prosecutions for cutting down a tree.</p>

          <p>Despite policy challenges and political headwinds, the U.S. wind energy industry is entering a "repowering" era as aging turbines require upgrades or replacements. Operators are increasingly choosing to replace older turbines with technologically advanced models, increasing electricity output. This trend presents new business opportunities for market leaders like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. Repowering existing wind farms offers economic benefits, including no need to acquire property and the potential for higher output at a lower cost, while also invigorating the recycling industry for decommissioned turbine components.</p>
