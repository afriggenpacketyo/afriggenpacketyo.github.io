          <p>A large fire broke out at a Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, California, one of the largest on the U.S. West Coast, following reports of an explosion. Chevron's on-site fire department, along with local emergency services, responded to the incident and successfully contained the blaze. The company confirmed that all personnel and contractors were accounted for and that no injuries occurred as a result of the fire. Officials did not issue evacuation orders for the surrounding area, as monitoring systems detected no dangerous emissions beyond the facility's fenceline.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terror attack outside a Manchester synagogue, UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has expressed disappointment that pro-Palestinian protests continued, describing the decision as feeling "un-British." Mahmood urged demonstrators to reconsider future marches, while noting that police have powers to intervene if they cannot manage the protests safely. The statement came after 40 arrests were made at a separate demonstration in London. The UK's Chief Rabbi also called for the government to address the demonstrations, linking the rhetoric on the streets to the recent violence against the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>China and India are set to resume direct flights, marking a significant step toward normalizing relations after a five-year suspension that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued amid border tensions. India's largest airline, IndiGo, announced it will restart services between Kolkata and Guangzhou on October 26, with plans for a New Delhi route soon. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that the resumption of flights is contingent on carrier approvals and is expected to enhance people-to-people exchanges. This move signals a cautious effort by both nations to repair diplomatic and economic ties.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been recalled to the England national team for the upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia after recovering from a hamstring injury. Saka's return is a key change to the squad, which notably omits star players Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Jack Grealish. The 24-year-old recently made his comeback for Arsenal, scoring in a win against Olympiacos. His inclusion comes as England prepares for a friendly and a crucial World Cup qualifier, where a victory in Latvia would move them closer to securing a spot in the 2026 tournament.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have identified Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, as the two men killed in a terror attack outside a synagogue on Yom Kippur. The attacker, named as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot and killed by police after ramming his car into pedestrians and attacking them with a knife. Britain's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, described the crime as the result of "an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred," highlighting a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents in the UK. The attack has prompted widespread condemnation and calls for increased security for the British Jewish community.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair as a key figure in his 20-point plan for post-war Gaza, intended to be part of a "Board of Peace." Blair, known for his role in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, brings diplomatic experience but is also a controversial figure due to his support for the 2003 Iraq invasion. His potential involvement has drawn mixed reactions, with some Palestinian officials cautiously welcoming the effort while Hamas has denounced it. Critics in the UK and internationally remain skeptical, citing Blair's polarizing legacy and the perceived imposition of a Western-led solution.</p>

He argues that players should intuitively understand their performance and that providing justifications is unnecessary.

Pochettino emphasized his goal of changing the team's culture to one where a spot on the World Cup roster is earned through consistent performance, not past reputation.</p>

The number of students requiring high-level support through education, health and care plans (EHCPs) is projected to continue rising sharply.

          <p>As the annual Nobel Prize announcements approach, this article examines their continued relevance and critiques their historical biases. While the prizes successfully popularize major scientific achievements, such as mRNA vaccines and gene-editing, they are criticized for promoting a "genius scientist" myth that overlooks the collaborative nature of modern research. The analysis also highlights a significant lack of diversity, with laureates overwhelmingly being male and from Western institutions in the US and Europe. Critics argue that this bias can exacerbate funding inequalities and fails to recognize groundbreaking work from other parts of the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues into its second day, the White House is reportedly considering laying off thousands of federal workers. This potential escalation comes as negotiations between the Trump administration and congressional leaders remain at a standstill. The shutdown has already furloughed hundreds of thousands of employees and disrupted government services across the country. The prospect of mass layoffs adds another layer of economic and personal uncertainty for federal workers and their families, increasing the pressure on politicians to reach a funding agreement and reopen the government.</p>

          <p>An updated report from the EAT-Lancet Commission, which advocates for a "planetary health diet" with less meat and more plant-based foods, is being targeted by what appears to be a coordinated online misinformation campaign. A new investigation suggests that industry-friendly influencers and scientists are working to discredit the research, portraying it as elitist and anti-science, similar to the backlash the original 2019 report faced. Experts express concern that the spread of disinformation is being amplified by weakened content moderation on social media platforms and the rise of AI-generated fake news, undermining public health and climate initiatives.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Andrej Babis, the billionaire populist and former prime minister who is a leading candidate in the upcoming Czech parliamentary elections. The 71-year-old leader of the ANO party campaigns as an anti-establishment outsider, promising to run the state like a business and fight corruption, despite being a long-standing member of the country's elite. Babis's political career has been marked by persistent allegations of fraud, conflicts of interest, and collaboration with the communist-era secret service. Despite these controversies, his populist appeal remains strong, particularly in his criticism of "green madness" and the political establishment.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian man, part of a group of West Africans deported from the United States to Ghana, claims he and five others were secretly taken across the border and abandoned in Togo by Ghanaian officials. The man, who fears returning to Nigeria due to his political activism, says they are now stranded in a hotel without documents or resources. This incident raises questions about Ghana's agreement with the U.S. to accept deportees from third countries, a policy criticized by human rights advocates.

          <p>Thirty-five years after German reunification, significant social and economic gaps persist between the former East and West, according to a new government report. While younger generations have grown up in a unified country, those in the East still face lower incomes, less inherited wealth, and more limited public infrastructure in rural areas. The federal commissioner for eastern Germany, Elisabeth Kaiser, highlights that these disadvantages shape lives and contribute to a distinct "East German" identity that is less common in the West. Despite economic growth, demographic challenges like an aging population threaten to widen the divide.</p>
