          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. However, forecast maps indicate the storm's path will turn east-northeastward, moving it away from the southeastern United States. While a tropical storm watch for Florida has been canceled, Imelda is currently bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas. Swells from the storm are still expected to affect the U.S. East Coast, creating potentially life-threatening surf and rip current conditions this week.</p>

While essential services like Social Security and air traffic control will continue, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs without pay, which could harm consumer confidence. The disruption also threatens the timely release of key economic data, such as the jobs report, complicating the Federal Reserve's policy decisions at a sensitive time for the U.S. economy.

          <p>Financial therapist Aja Evans has cautioned against the popular TikTok trend of "manifesting" wealth, stating that belief alone is not a substitute for concrete action. The trend, which suggests that visualizing a goal can make it happen, is particularly popular among younger Americans but lacks a basis in financial reality. Evans advises that while a positive mindset is helpful, it must be paired with practical steps like creating a budget, applying for jobs, or developing a financial plan to achieve goals such as paying off debt or saving for a home.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover will begin a phased resumption of manufacturing in the coming days after a cyberattack forced a complete halt to its UK operations on September 1. The engine facility in Wolverhampton is expected to be the first to restart, with other plants to follow gradually. The company stated it is working with cybersecurity specialists and UK authorities to ensure a safe and secure return to production. The shutdown has placed significant financial strain on JLR's supply chain, prompting a £1.5 billion government loan guarantee.</p>

          <p>The White House is evaluating a request from Ukraine for long-range Tomahawk missiles, which have a range capable of reaching Moscow from Ukrainian territory, according to Vice President JD Vance. The potential sale would align with the Trump administration's policy of having European NATO allies pay for weapons supplied to Ukraine. The consideration marks a potential escalation in the type of weaponry provided to Kyiv, as U.S. officials have expressed a desire for Ukraine to have the ability to conduct long-range strikes to repel Russian forces.</p>

          <p>The fashion accessory chain Claire's has been partially saved from collapse in the UK after Modella Capital agreed to purchase 156 of its stores, securing approximately 1,000 jobs. However, the deal does not include the remaining 145 stores, leaving the future of their 1,000 employees uncertain. Administrators will continue to trade the remaining stores while exploring options. The brand, popular with teens for its accessories and ear-piercing services, entered administration in August, putting over 2,000 jobs at risk across the UK and Ireland.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned that a new online booking system for same-day GP appointments in England, set to launch this week, could endanger patients. The doctors' union argues the system cannot adequately distinguish between urgent and non-urgent cases, potentially delaying care for serious conditions. The BMA is calling for a halt to the rollout to implement better safeguards, such as allowing practices to switch off the system during peak demand. However, the government insists the changes will improve patient access and reduce phone wait times.</p>

          <p>The portrayal of fathers in television sitcoms has both reflected and shaped the evolving concept of American fatherhood, according to pop culture critic Phillip Maciak. From the stoic, suburban provider like Ward Cleaver in the 1950s to more actively co-parenting figures like Cliff Huxtable in the 1980s, TV dads map a cultural shift. The article notes that today's image of fatherhood is particularly contested, caught between a flexible, supportive ideal and a retro-patriarchal vision. This analysis comes as more young men express a desire for parenthood.</p>

          <p>A court in China has handed down death sentences to 11 members of the Ming crime family for running extensive scam and gambling operations in Laukkai, Myanmar, near the Chinese border. Dozens of other members received sentences including life imprisonment. The syndicate was a key player in the regional "scamdemic," where thousands of people were forced to work in fraudulent call centers. The court found the group was also responsible for drug trafficking, prostitution, and the murder of workers who attempted to escape.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce a new Labour policy requiring legal migrants to demonstrate their contribution to society to earn permanent settlement status. Under the proposal, individuals would need to learn English to a high standard, maintain a clean criminal record, and volunteer in their community to qualify for indefinite leave to remain. The plan, which also extends the qualifying period from five to ten years, is being positioned as a "fair migration" approach, contrasting with the government's policies and those of Reform UK.</p>
