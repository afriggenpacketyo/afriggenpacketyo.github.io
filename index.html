          <p>At a global public security forum in Lianyungang, China showcased advanced police equipment, including AI-enhanced body cameras, to officials from developing nations. A key feature was an intelligent command system that links bodycams to a database of high-risk individuals, using facial recognition to identify suspects and send real-time alerts. This technology allows a central command to locate a suspect, identify nearby officers on a map, and dispatch them for an arrest. The system's terminals are designed to be rugged, with military-grade drop resistance for demanding operational environments.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following controversial comments made by the host about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel linked the alleged killer to the MAGA movement, prompting significant backlash and a suggestion from the FCC chair that ABC's broadcast license could be at risk. Major affiliate owner Nexstar Media Group also announced it would preempt the show, citing the host's statements as offensive and not in the public interest. The move has ignited a fierce debate about free speech, corporate accountability, and political pressure on media.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student known for his involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests. The ruling states Khalil must be removed to either Algeria or Syria, citing that he allegedly misrepresented his background on his green card application. Khalil's legal team argues the decision is a form of political retaliation by the Trump administration for his activism and free speech. They plan to appeal the ruling, which they claim was rushed and procedurally irregular, as part of a wider lawsuit against the government.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters currently expect the system to remain over open waters and have not issued any immediate threats to land. However, the storm is predicted to intensify over the weekend and could potentially develop into a low-grade hurricane. Its projected track carries it north of the Caribbean, but it may approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen, though the long-range forecast remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Huawei has unveiled a new supernode computing cluster that it claims can deliver world-class AI performance without relying on advanced chips from Nvidia. This development represents a significant breakthrough for China's technological self-reliance amidst stringent U.S. export controls designed to limit its access to high-end semiconductors. The company also announced a roadmap for upgraded Ascend AI chips over the next three years, signaling its intent to compete directly with major U.S. chip designers. This move underpins Beijing's push for its tech giants to prioritize domestic technology.</p>

          <p>In its strongest statement to date, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published a report declaring that the evidence for human-caused global warming is "beyond scientific dispute." The report directly challenges the Trump administration's efforts to revoke the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," a key ruling that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and mandates their regulation. The scientific body concluded that the 2009 finding was accurate and has only been strengthened by subsequent research, warning that climate-induced harm will continue to worsen.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that her first choice for a running mate in the 2024 presidential election was Pete Buttigieg. She writes that while she considered him an "ideal partner," she ultimately decided against it, believing that a ticket featuring a Black woman and a gay man would be "too big of a risk" for the country to accept. Harris expresses that she and Buttigieg shared a "mutual sadness" over the political calculation. She eventually selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the ticket, which went on to lose to Donald Trump.</p>

The requests include 5,000 new rifle rounds for UC San Diego and more pepper-ball launchers and sponge foam rounds for UCLA. This approval comes amid heightened scrutiny of UC's handling of campus protests, with critics and some faculty members expressing concern that the new equipment will be used against students and staff exercising their right to free speech.

          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume small amounts of alcohol through their diet of fermented fruit. Researchers measured the ethanol content in fruits eaten by the chimps and calculated that their daily intake is equivalent to nearly two alcoholic beverages for a human. This finding provides the first direct chemical evidence to support the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which posits that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary origins linked to the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors.</p>

          <p>According to a new report, California continues to have the highest poverty rate in the United States, tied with Louisiana. The analysis from the California Budget and Policy Center found that in 2024, about 17.7% of the state's residents, or 7 million people, could not afford their basic needs. The poverty rate surged after the expiration of effective pandemic-era aid programs like the expanded child tax credit, which had briefly lowered the rate to a historic low in 2021. The report underscores that poverty is a policy choice and warns that recent budget cuts could worsen the situation.</p>
