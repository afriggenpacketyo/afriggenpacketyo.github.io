          <p>As finance ministers and central bankers gather in Washington D.C. for the IMF and World Bank meetings, Europe's diverging economic landscape will be a central focus. The continent is experiencing a "three-speed" recovery, with political uncertainty in France rattling markets and potentially slowing growth, while Germany is on a firmer footing with forecasts for outperformance in 2026. This economic and political fragmentation presents homegrown challenges for the bloc at a time when external pressures demand unity and a cohesive strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed its 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which for the first time strongly encourages inviting Taiwan's navy to the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) military drills. This move is interpreted as a significant signal of Washington's commitment to deterring Beijing's military ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region. The bipartisan bill also authorizes $1 billion for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative, expanding its scope to include combat casualty care and medical equipment, reinforcing U.S. support for the island's defense capabilities.</p>

Burgess makes a notable return to the national team after a decade-long absence, and Litten earns his second cap. However, the squad omits Super League's Man of Steel winner, Jake Connor, due to intense competition for positions in the halves. The selection also includes six players from Australia's NRL, reflecting the depth of talent available to head coach Shaun Wane.</p>

          <p>The heads of Germany's domestic and foreign intelligence services have issued stark warnings to the Bundestag regarding national security threats. The BfV chief cautioned that despite the recent Gaza peace deal, Hamas maintains infrastructure in Germany and the number of foreign extremists in the country is rising. Concurrently, the BND chief stated that the "icy peace" with Russia could escalate into a "hot confrontation," warning that Moscow would not shy away from direct military conflict with NATO to achieve its political goals in Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Chen Li, an economist at Soochow Securities, the ongoing global bull market is fundamentally supported by a weakening U.S. dollar, which should help Chinese stocks remain on course despite recent tariff threats from President Trump. While market jitters persist due to concerns over U.S. fiscal policy and global economic outlooks, Chen argues that investors have become largely "immune" to the prospect of higher duties. He suggests that while trade tensions can trigger market corrections, they are unlikely to have a major long-term impact on the market's overall trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Across the United States, residential natural gas bills are nearing record highs, even though the wholesale price of the gas itself is relatively low. This discrepancy is due to customers paying significantly more for infrastructure upgrades, utility operational costs, and taxes, which now constitute about two-thirds of the average bill. Spurred by a deadly 2010 pipeline explosion, utilities have invested billions in replacing old pipes, passing these costs to ratepayers, a trend that conflicts with long-term climate goals to shift away from fossil fuels.</p>

Key elements of the broader plan include the complete demilitarization of Gaza, governance by a transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats, and an eventual handover to a reformed Palestinian Authority, though significant sticking points like Hamas's disarmament remain.</p>

This case follows a 2013 ruling that weakened another part of the landmark 1965 law and could have profound implications for congressional and local district mapping across the nation, potentially making it easier for states to draw lines that dilute minority voting power.</p>

          <p>After a period of decline, average mortgage rates in the UK have seen a slight month-on-month increase, signaling a more cautious approach from lenders heading into winter. The average rate for a two or five-year fixed-rate mortgage now stands at approximately 5%. Analysts suggest that the likelihood of further immediate base rate cuts by the Bank of England appears low, and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming Budget is contributing to this plateau in borrowing costs. While rates are much lower than the peaks of two years ago, the increase may still disappoint new and renewing borrowers.</p>

The alleged abuse occurred before and after he was removed from the priesthood in 2007.

          <p>The new film "Roofman," starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, tells the true story of a thief who lived secretly in a Toys “R” Us. Director Derek Cianfrance reveals he pitched the movie as a modern Frank Capra film, focusing on themes of community, acceptance, and the dreams of working-class people. To achieve authenticity, Cianfrance created an immersive set where actors were encouraged to live their roles, such as having Peter Dinklage, as the store manager, actually interview Dunst for her character's job. The approach aimed to capture unscripted, genuine moments that would become immortalized on screen.</p>

          <p>A Texas-based company's plan to reactivate three offshore oil drilling platforms near Santa Barbara is facing significant legal and regulatory hurdles from the state of California. Sable Offshore Corp. is now facing a lawsuit from the state's attorney general and criminal charges from the Santa Barbara district attorney, both alleging repeated violations of environmental laws. These setbacks cast doubt on the project's future, which was initially pitched to investors as being "primed for cash flow." The company is now exploring an alternative plan to bypass state oversight by keeping its operations entirely in federal waters.</p>

          <p>California's Insurance Commissioner, Ricardo Lara, has proposed controversial changes to a landmark 1988 law, aiming to make it harder for public advocates to get reimbursed by insurers for challenging rate increases. Lara argues the current system has enriched a single advocacy group, Consumer Watchdog, by allowing it to claim credit for savings and delay the rate review process. Consumer Watchdog counters that the proposal is a giveaway to the insurance industry, designed to fast-track rate hikes and silence critics, while the industry supports the changes as "much-needed reforms."</p>

Records and testimony indicate that after the incident, a high-ranking DEA official tried to dissuade the victim from reporting it to the police.

          <p>While debris from the Palisades fire has been cleared from many properties, the Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Estates, an affordable, rent-controlled community, remains largely untouched. FEMA declined to fund the cleanup of the Bowl, citing the owners' poor track record and a lack of commitment to reopening the park as affordable housing, unlike a neighboring park which did receive aid. This has left the 170 former residents, many of whom are on fixed incomes, in limbo and unsure if they will ever be able to return to one of the few affordable enclaves on the California coast.</p>

          <p>The recent suspension and subsequent return of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, following pressure from the FCC over comments about Trump supporters, has unexpectedly demonstrated the continued relevance of late-night television. The initial decision to sideline Kimmel sparked a significant public backlash, with artists, celebrities, and civil liberties groups protesting what was seen as government censorship. The strong viewer support and high ratings for his return episode suggest that, despite declining overall viewership, late-night hosts still hold a unique and influential space in pop culture and political discourse.</p>
