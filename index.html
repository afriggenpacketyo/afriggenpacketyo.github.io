            <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered his first major public address since leaving office to the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled (ACRD) in Chicago. Biden focused on strengthening Social Security, highlighting its importance for Americans who have paid into it throughout their lives. He was joined by other political figures to discuss bolstering the system, reducing red tape, and eliminating unnecessary spending. Biden's speech comes after he withdrew from the 2024 presidential race due to concerns about his age and mental acuity, passing the torch to Kamala Harris, who was ultimately defeated by Donald Trump.</p>

            <p>A CDC team was slated to begin a project to assist flood victims in North Carolina, but the team was cut due to layoffs directed by Elon Musk's DOGE. The team was prepared to survey 210 households about enduring challenges residents of Asheville's Buncombe County faced after Hurricane Helene. The team's mission was to collect and process that survey data and write up a report within 48 hours, so that local officials could solve residents' most pressing problems. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressed sympathy for those who lost their jobs, and said that the goal is to streamline divisions within the agency and get rid of redundancies.</p>

The current 'deal' seems to focus on science, technology, and AI cooperation in exchange for avoiding tariffs.

The U.S. is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on China for heavy rare earths processing, and it lacks the capacity to fill the gap if China shuts down exports.

            <p>Farmers across the United States are facing potential financial ruin due to Donald Trump's tariffs and cuts to federal programs. Small- and medium-sized farms are already struggling with climate shocks and volatile markets. The loss of federal programs, combined with trade chaos, is creating uncertainty for farmers. Many are calling for a taxpayer-funded bailout to compensate for losses generated by the administration's policies.</p>

            <p>The US tourism industry is expressing concerns about a potential 'Trump slump' due to the president's tariff policies and political climate. Preliminary figures show a decline in visits to the US from overseas, with some attributing it to Trump's efforts to reshape economic relations. Delta Air Lines has reduced flying expansion due to disappointing bookings, and Las Vegas projects a decline in room tax revenue. However, a weakening dollar could make travel to the US more attractive.</p>

South Carolina executed two inmates by firing squad, and Idaho made it the primary method.
