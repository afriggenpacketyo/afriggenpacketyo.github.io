          <p>The Trump administration defended its tariffs in trade court, arguing that removing them would undermine the president's position in trade talks with China. The lawsuit, led by Oregon and 11 other states, challenges the tariffs imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The administration argued that the president's emergency declarations are not subject to judicial review, claiming it is a political question for Congress to resolve. The tariffs were implemented in response to concerns over fentanyl production and trafficking. Optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa engaged in a tense exchange regarding allegations of white genocide in South Africa, with Elon Musk present. Trump presented videos and stories purportedly showing violence against white South Africans, while Ramaphosa and his delegation refuted the claims, emphasizing that crime affects all demographics. The meeting aimed to reset US-South Africa relations, but the discussion underscored deep divisions, as Trump insisted on the existence of a white genocide, while Ramaphosa highlighted the broader issue of criminality affecting all South Africans. Senator Tim Kaine has challenged the Trump administration's prioritization of Afrikaners, asserting that claims of their persecution are specious. Optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to pass a bill prohibiting the use of any foreign aircraft as Air Force One, following the Pentagon's acceptance of a Qatari jet.

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding is renaming its digital entertainment division as Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group, using the Chinese name for the orca, or killer whale, as part of a strategy to revitalize growth outside its core e-commerce and cloud businesses. The company says that orcas are large, flexible, and smart, and can adapt to complex environments, characteristics consistent with the group's concept of digital intelligence, symbiosis, and happiness. The rebranding adds to Alibaba's "zoo" of animal-themed businesses and aligns with its strategy to return to its original mission and start a new business.

On-chain data indicates less selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market, with investors anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further drive prices higher.

          <p>A New York Times article reveals a fierce debate among officials in three cabinet agencies after the Trump administration wrongfully deported a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador. Despite a judge's ruling prohibiting his deportation to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was sent there due to a bureaucratic slip-up. Officials discussed portraying Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader without evidence and sought to downplay the danger he might face in a Salvadoran prison. The Justice Department lawyer who advised bringing Abrego Garcia back was fired, and Abrego Garcia remains imprisoned in El Salvador despite court rulings demanding his release.

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with claims of Afrikaners being 'persecuted' and white 'genocide'. Trump dimmed the lights and played a video that he said supported his claim that white farmers were being "persecuted" in the country. Ramaphosa disputed Trump's allegation, stating that black people were far more likely to be victims of violence in South Africa than white people. Trump also said that he would seek an "explanation" from his guest on claims of white "genocide" in South Africa, which have been widely discredited. Optimism score is 30.</p>
