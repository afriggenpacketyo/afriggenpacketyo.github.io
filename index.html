          <p>President Trump met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa amidst a contentious debate over the status of Afrikaners, descendants of European colonizers, as refugees in the United States. The Trump administration welcomed a group of white South Africans claiming persecution, a move criticized by Ramaphosa as "cowardly." Trump asserted a "genocide" against white farmers, a claim disputed by South African police data, which indicates farm killings affect both Black workers and white farmers. The situation involves complex issues of land ownership, racial equity, and political motivations, with organizations set up to support South Africans seeking refuge in the United States. Relevant context includes the history of apartheid and ongoing efforts to address racial inequalities in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's digital crimes unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project, which had infected over 394,000 Windows computers worldwide. The malware, popular among cybercriminals, was used to steal passwords, credit card information, bank account details, and cryptocurrency wallets. The operation involved seizing over 1,300 domains and working with tech companies like Cloudflare and Lumen to sever communications between the malware and its victims. The Lumma malware had been actively sold in underground forums since 2022, and was used in phishing campaigns targeting online gaming communities, education systems, and critical infrastructure. One notable example involved a March 2025 phishing campaign impersonating Booking.com.</p>

          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar as a gift to be used as part of the Air Force One fleet, a decision that has sparked criticism and debate. The plane, valued at an estimated $400 million, will require extensive modifications to meet security and functional requirements for presidential transport. The acceptance raises legal and ethical questions under the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits gifts to public officials from foreign governments without congressional approval. While the White House insists the gift is legal as it is given to the Defense Department, critics express concerns about potential influence and security risks, with the new plane slated for use until Boeing delivers updated aircraft.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price briefly hit a new all-time high of $109,500 before slipping back due to rising Treasury yields and stock market declines. The cryptocurrency's rise was attributed to factors like softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which increased interest in bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking bitcoin's price surpassed $40 billion, supported by liquidity in the stock market and risk-off scenarios related to tariffs and deficits. Investors anticipate further regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to drive prices higher, with public companies now holding about 15% of the total bitcoin supply (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faced judicial rebuke after a deportation flight carrying eight migrants, some with serious criminal records, was sent to an undisclosed location, potentially violating a court order. Lawyers alleged the flight was destined for South Sudan, a country plagued by violence, prompting a federal judge to demand the administration retain custody and control of the deportees. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the deportation but declined to reveal the flight's final destination, citing security concerns.

          <p>A Wisconsin angler discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that sank in Lake Michigan over a century ago. Christopher Thuss found the wreckage in shallow water near Manitowoc, Wisconsin, revealing a piece of lost maritime history. The J.C. Ames, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the Great Lakes, used for moving lumber and transporting railway cars before being scuttled in 1923. Historians are working to locate shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before invasive quagga mussels cause further damage. This discovery highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve the region's rich maritime heritage.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses market distractions, such as President Trump's budget plans, debt downgrades, and the upcoming tariff wall, arguing that these events create opportunities for long-term investors to buy quality stocks at lower prices. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on the underlying companies and their leadership rather than short-term market fluctuations. Cramer highlights the data center industrial revolution as a key story and identifies buying opportunities in companies like GE Vernova, Home Depot, and TJX, noting that the distractions provide better entry points for those with conviction in their investments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump's attacks on South Africa for seizing land from white farmers contrast with his own administration's use of eminent domain to build the border wall. Trump has criticized South Africa's law allowing the government to seize privately held land without compensation when in the public interest, while his administration filed lawsuits against landowners in Texas to secure space for the wall. The article highlights the hypocrisy of Trump's position, noting his past advocacy for eminent domain as a casino developer. Richard Drawe, a Texas farmer, expressed his frustration with the government's taking of his land, illustrating the human impact of such policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's allies in Congress are working to pass a tax and spending bill, but face dissent from hard-line Republicans seeking deeper spending cuts, and others wanting bigger tax cuts. The bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," includes extending tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime wages, and additional spending on defense and border security. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt, leading to opposition from Democrats and some Republicans. Despite Trump's efforts to sway votes, the bill's prospects remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants potentially deported to South Sudan, amid concerns that they were removed in violation of an earlier order. The order from Judge Brian Murphy directs the government to ensure the possibility of return if the court finds the removals unlawful. The judge's order follows claims that migrants had been sent to the conflict-ridden country, which the State Department advises Americans not to visit. The Justice Department asserted that one migrant had been deported to Myanmar, not South Sudan, but declined to comment on the whereabouts of another.</p>

Both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris supported the idea during campaign appearances. The bill, if enacted, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, but tips must be reported to qualify. While proponents claim it will provide relief to hardworking Americans, analysts note that the benefits may be limited to moderate- to middle-income workers and could incentivize income misclassification (not investment advice).</p>
