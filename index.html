          <p>Following the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, top House Democrats are urging Speaker Mike Johnson to enhance security measures for House members both in Washington and their home districts. They are requesting a substantial increase in the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) to support additional safety precautions for every office. Senators are scheduled to receive a security briefing from law enforcement on Tuesday, and House Democrats will participate in a virtual briefing. The number of threats against members of Congress has been rising, prompting concerns about safety, especially during election years. </p>

          <p>Following the fatal shootings of Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, Republicans have offered mixed reactions, ranging from condemnation to mockery. While some GOP figures, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have denounced the violence, others, like Utah Senator Mike Lee, have used the tragedy to criticize their Democratic opponents. Former President Trump initially condemned the attacks but later criticized Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz. Experts warn that the divisive rhetoric may resonate more widely than statements of condolence, contributing to an atmosphere of "violent populism" in the United States.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is warning Senate Republicans against cutting Medicaid benefits in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," aligning himself with Trump's stance on preserving the healthcare program. Hawley argues that Republicans should heed Trump's call to avoid Medicaid benefit cuts and prevent rural hospital closures. While Hawley supports measures to eliminate waste and fraud in Medicaid, he opposes stripping benefits from working individuals who rely on the program for healthcare access because they cannot afford private insurance. Hawley's position could influence the fate of the legislative package in the Senate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order on President Trump's ban prohibiting foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. until next Monday. Harvard's lawyers argued that the proclamation violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch, claiming it is retaliation against the institution. The government argued that it does not "trust" Harvard to vet and monitor foreign students. The judge questioned the government's concerns, noting that they could apply to other institutions as well.</p>

          <p>A LendingTree survey found that 67% of newlyweds took on debt to pay for their wedding. Experts advise that if having a certain kind of wedding is a high priority, taking on some debt can be acceptable if approached carefully. Using a credit card with a 0% introductory offer is a wise option if you can repay the debt within the promotional period. A personal line of credit with a lower interest rate may also be a suitable choice for larger expenses. (not investment advice)</p>
