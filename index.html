          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 18:57:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that Kneecap's scheduled performance at Glastonbury Festival is "not appropriate," referencing member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh's court appearance on terror charges. This follows Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch's call for the BBC to not broadcast Kneecap's performance. A BBC spokesperson responded that their plans would adhere to editorial guidelines, and that the festival organizers book the artists. Kneecap previously won a discrimination case against the UK government after Badenoch tried to block their funding. The article suggests that the Prime Minister's comments will likely increase the band's profile. </p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran war has entered its second week, marked by further strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan. Iran's foreign minister warned against US intervention in the conflict, deeming it "very dangerous." The Israeli military reports killing three senior Iranian commanders and destroying over 50% of Iran's missile launchers. The US State Department confirmed that several US citizens sustained minor injuries from Iranian missile strikes, and assisted departure flights from Tel Aviv to Athens have begun for US citizens and permanent residents. President Trump is considering military intervention and will decide within two weeks. </p>

          <p>The presence of a senior Taiwanese officer at a military exercise in Alaska has garnered significant attention, suggesting closer defense cooperation between Taiwan and the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force’s flight training division, participated as an observer in the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise. Analysts suggest the move indicates the US commitment to its security allies, despite President Trump’s transactional approach. The exercise involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the US, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and other countries.</p>

The DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support and record individual donations since February, while some strategists suggest the party needs a new vision. Tesla founder Elon Musk's significant contributions to Republicans in the 2024 election cycle contributed to the RNC's financial advantage. (not investment advice)</p>
