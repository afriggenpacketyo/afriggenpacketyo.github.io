          <p>Reform UK secured a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating the Labour Party by just six votes after a recount. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, overturned a significant Labour majority to win the seat, marking a notable achievement for the right-wing party led by Nigel Farage. This victory is especially significant as it marks Reform's first parliamentary by-election win, signaling a potential shift in the political landscape and posing challenges to both the Labour and Conservative parties. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent.</p>

          <p>The European Union is engaged in a high-stakes bargaining act with the United States and China, seeking economic carve-outs from both superpowers. The EU aims to balance its relationships with the US, which seeks to limit ties with China, and China, while avoiding being caught in the middle of their negotiations. The article highlights the complexities of navigating these relationships, as cutting a deal with one power could jeopardize the possibility of doing so with the other. Officials in Brussels frequently refer to this delicate situation as a “high-wire act.”</p>

          <p>The UK's recent RAF attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen, approved by the Labour government, signals a closer military alignment with the Trump administration's intensified war in the region. This action has drawn criticism due to reports of high civilian casualties and the UK's broader support for Israel in the Gaza war. The article argues that this alignment could alienate Labour's supporters, especially those on the political left who strongly support the Palestinians. The author contends that the UK should use its influence to restrain Netanyahu's government instead of increasing military support for Trump.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a decision with significant socio-economic and political implications. The move is likely to lead to demands for increased quotas in government jobs and college admissions for certain castes. While colonial rulers counted all castes until 1931, independent India has only counted Dalits and Adivasis since 1951. The announcement comes months before a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a key issue. The article notes that the opposition and Modi's partners have been pressing the government to count caste in the census.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs. This move aims to help U.S. manufacturers compete with low-cost Chinese products but is expected to increase prices for American consumers. The exemption had allowed products up to $800 to avoid tariffs, leading to a surge in individually addressed packages from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu.
