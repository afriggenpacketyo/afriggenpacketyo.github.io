          <p>President Trump is actively pressuring the Washington Commanders football team to revert to their former "Redskins" name, threatening to derail a planned stadium deal in Washington, D.C., if they refuse. He claims a significant public demand for this change, despite the name's retirement in 2020 due to its racist connotations towards Indigenous people. Trump also extended this demand to the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, which similarly changed its name in 2021. While the D.C. Council is considering a multibillion-dollar redevelopment plan for the federal property, the exact method for Trump's potential intervention remains unclear, introducing uncertainty into the team's relocation efforts.</p>

          <h2>Canada Faces Major Measles Outbreak, Exceeding US Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:50:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 cases, primarily affecting children and infants, a figure nearly triple that of the United States despite Canada's smaller population. This makes Canada the only Western country listed among the top 10 globally for measles outbreaks, with Alberta as the current epicenter. Experts attribute the rapid spread to lower vaccination rates, particularly within certain conservative communities, and a surge in anti-vaccine misinformation following the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials emphasize that raising MMR vaccination rates is crucial to containing the highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to severe complications.</p>

          <p>Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner, a former NFL defensive back who played for the Washington Redskins, publicly supported President Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to revert to their original "Redskins" name. Turner, who played for the team from 1995 to 1997, stated on X that Trump is "right" and it's "time to bring the Redskins’ name back." This endorsement comes as Trump threatens to jeopardize the Commanders' new stadium deal if the name change isn't made. However, current Commanders owner Josh Harris has explicitly stated his intention to move forward with the "Commanders" name and not look back.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer argues that despite looming tariff deadlines, the stock market is poised for continued growth, driven by ten key factors. He highlights strong second-quarter earnings, significant economic boosts from President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" Act through various tax reliefs and deductions, and increased business investment incentives. Additionally, Cramer points to massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the energy sector, relaxed bank lending rules, and a revitalized IPO market as positive indicators. He suggests that short-sellers will face challenges in this environment, anticipating a potential GDP boom under Trump's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission, first established nearly two decades ago, to address a projected £800 annual shortfall for people retiring in 2050. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of inadequate retirement savings, noting that almost half of working-age adults are not contributing to a private pension. Low earners, the self-employed, women, and certain ethnic groups are particularly affected by this shortfall. The relaunched Commission, set to report in 2027, will focus on private sector pensions, seeking to build a national consensus on future strategy to boost retirement pots.</p>

          <p>Alcohol is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen due to its strong link to increased oral cancer risk, affecting over 50,000 people in the U.S. annually. It promotes inflammation, damages DNA through the toxic chemical acetaldehyde, and impairs the absorption of protective nutrients like folate and vitamins A, C, and E. Alcohol also negatively alters the oral microbiome, increasing the risk of gum disease. While even light drinking elevates risk, heavy consumption significantly amplifies it, making moderation or abstinence, alongside a nutrient-rich diet and regular dental check-ups, crucial for prevention.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals declining public support for President Trump's deportation program, which initially had majority backing but is now slightly net-negative. Most Americans believe the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected, leading to reduced approval, especially among Hispanic Americans. The poll also indicates widespread public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than tariffs, with nearly two-thirds disapproving of Trump's handling of inflation. Despite this, most Americans still acknowledge Trump is delivering on campaign promises, though fewer independents and Democrats agree.</p>

This outcome undermines the coalition's influence, having already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Historically, such losses have led to prime ministerial resignations, but Ishiba's immediate focus is on ongoing trade negotiations, indicating a period of potential political drama and destabilization.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Price of Children" by Maria Laurino, uncovers a Vatican-orchestrated program from 1950 to 1970 that sent 3,500 Italian children, mostly born out of wedlock, to the U.S. as "orphans" for adoption. Many mothers were deceived, told their children had died, or pressured into relinquishing them without proper consent, believing the placements were temporary. The Church charged fees for these adoptions, with priests actively seeking out children across Italy, effectively creating a "machine" for the program. This historical practice caused profound grief and a lifelong search for identity among the affected adoptees and their birth families, highlighting the devastating impact of the deception.</p>

          <p>Following his British Open victory, Scottie Scheffler's unparalleled dominance in golf is increasingly drawing comparisons to Tiger Woods's peak era. The 29-year-old American has now won four majors in 1,197 days, matching Woods's pace to his fourth major, along with 13 PGA Tour victories and an Olympic gold medal. Scheffler's machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments, even when not at his absolute best, are key factors in his success. Despite his unorthodox footwork, his improved putting, aided by a switch to a claw grip, has elevated him to a level of sustained excellence rarely seen since Woods, solidifying his status as the undisputed world number one.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with plans to shutter the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD), its primary scientific research arm. This move, part of a 23% staff cut, aims to save $748.8 million, with the EPA claiming it will shift scientific expertise to other offices and create a new "Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions." However, Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups strongly condemn the decision, warning of "generational impacts on Americans' health and safety" and a crippled ability for the EPA to use scientific research in policy-making and technical assistance.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert and researcher, having studied over 200 parent-child relationships, identifies "self-connection"—the ability to tune into one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice—as the single most crucial skill for a child's lifelong success. Subtle, well-meaning parental responses can inadvertently erode this connection, leading to anxiety, reactivity, or insecurity. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, acting as a powerful buffer against mental health challenges. Parents can cultivate this vital skill by validating emotions, welcoming children's full selves, avoiding micromanagement, and modeling their own self-awareness.</p>

While China has taken steps to restrict fentanyl precursors, potentially leading to lower US tariffs, reciprocal action from the US has not yet materialized.
