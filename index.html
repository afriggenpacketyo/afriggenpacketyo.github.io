          <p>President Trump is contemplating deploying active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to suppress immigration protests, as confirmed by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's suggestion. This follows the arrival of California National Guard troops in the city, a move criticized by Democratic governors, including California's Gavin Newsom. Trump stated that the threshold for sending Marines depends on his judgment of the situation and the perceived danger to the country and its citizens. He also accused protestors of spitting at police officers, introducing a harsh response policy. The situation has sparked controversy and debate over the use of military force in response to civilian protests, raising concerns about civil liberties and federal overreach.</p>

          <p>Harvard University's current struggles are drawing parallels to a school founded by George Soros that was forced to flee Hungary after being targeted by an authoritarian leader. Academics at the school suggest President Trump is employing a similar playbook against Harvard. This comparison underscores concerns about academic freedom and the potential for political interference in educational institutions. The situation highlights the challenges faced by universities in maintaining autonomy and resisting external pressures. The optimism score for this article is tempered due to the somber context of political interference.</p>

It also requires that a nation and its institutions actually try to provide assistance to targeted groups to help increase diversity in employment and education and help targeted groups overcome the systemic effects of centuries of discrimination?
