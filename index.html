          <p>Influential financial advisor Ric Edelman is now recommending that investors allocate between 10% and 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a dramatic increase from his previous advice. He attributes this change to crypto's evolution into a mainstream asset and the declining efficacy of the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio model. Edelman argues that cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for higher, non-correlated returns essential for modern long-term investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As extreme heat affects large portions of the United States, medical experts are issuing warnings about its significant negative effects on brain function and mental well-being. High temperatures can cause increased irritability, anxiety, and a decline in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and reaction time. To mitigate these risks, doctors advise the public to stay well-hydrated, avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours, and be aware that some psychiatric medications can impair the body's ability to cool itself.</p>

          <p>In a significant shift, the Supreme Court upheld a Texas law that mandates age verification for users of pornographic websites. The ruling changes the legal standard for such regulations from "strict scrutiny" to a more lenient "intermediate scrutiny," granting states greater authority to restrict adult content in the name of protecting minors. This analysis suggests the decision will likely lead to complicated legal challenges and could force judges into the awkward position of subjectively evaluating explicit material.</p>

          <p>This political analysis argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision to curb nationwide injunctions serves as a major boost to President Trump's executive authority. The ruling is framed as the removal of a critical judicial guardrail that had previously been used to halt several of the administration's most controversial policies. The article suggests this development, coming from a court with three Trump appointees, raises significant concerns about the balance of power and democratic norms.</p>

          <p>A sobering new study from The Pew Charitable Trusts has found that about 56 million American workers, or half of the private-sector workforce, lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k). This gap presents a massive obstacle to building financial security for old age, significantly widening the divide between the nation's retirement haves and have-nots. The research underscores a systemic crisis, as workers are 15 times more likely to save when funds are automatically deducted from paychecks.</p>

          <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is leading to a re-evaluation of computer science as a guaranteed path to a secure career. As AI becomes increasingly capable of handling entry-level coding tasks, there is concern that the demand for junior software engineers could decline, disrupting traditional career paths in the tech industry. This trend suggests that the job market of the future may place a higher value on uniquely human skills and less on purely technical ones.</p>

          <p>Family members of the 67 people who died in the January mid-air collision between an American Airlines flight and an Army Black Hawk helicopter are pressing Congress to do more to reform the nation's air traffic control system. While a current bill allocates $12.5 billion for modernization, advocates and industry experts argue this is just a down payment on what is needed to fully overhaul the antiquated system. The families are also calling for an independent safety review of the notoriously crowded airspace around Washington, D.C.</p>
