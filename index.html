          <p>Salesforce reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. However, the company's stock fell in extended trading after it issued a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, projecting figures at the low end of estimates. Despite the near-term concerns, Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook while raising its earnings guidance. The company has faced challenges this year, with its stock lagging behind tech peers amid slower growth and investor concerns about its position in the artificial intelligence boom.

          <p>Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced plans to make Florida the first state to phase out all mandatory childhood vaccinations for school attendance. The move was framed as a measure to protect parental rights and medical freedom, with Dr. Ladapo likening mandates to "slavery." The proposal immediately drew sharp criticism from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other health officials, who warned it could lead to outbreaks of preventable and deadly diseases like measles and polio, creating a public health disaster.</p>

          <p>Following a major military parade in China, former U.S. President Donald Trump provided a complex reaction, describing the event as "very, very impressive." He also expressed concern that the United States was not acknowledged for its historical help in securing China's freedom. In a separate social media post, Trump congratulated President Xi while simultaneously appearing to accuse him, along with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, of conspiring against the United States. This highlights a continued pattern of unpredictable foreign policy statements regarding global adversaries and allies.</p>

For its third-quarter forecast, Figma projected revenue that was ahead of consensus estimates. The company has been actively investing in artificial intelligence features and acquisitions to counter concerns that AI could displace the work of designers, a pressure felt across the software industry.

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters soared after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter results that significantly beat Wall Street estimates. The company credited its success to recent marketing campaigns featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce, which it said drove customer acquisition and positive traffic. Despite some controversy surrounding the Sweeney campaign, it led to sellouts of key denim products. The strong performance prompted American Eagle to reissue its full-year guidance, now expecting comparable sales to be approximately flat, an improvement over previous expectations.

          <p>Speaking in China after attending a military parade, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia is prepared to achieve all its objectives through military means if a diplomatic agreement with Ukraine is not reached. He described a potential negotiated solution as possible if "common sense prevails," but reiterated that Russia would not relinquish control of the Donbas region. Putin's remarks underscore the ongoing stalemate, as he repeated demands for Ukraine to remain outside of NATO and to cease alleged discrimination against ethnic Russians, reinforcing the hardline stance that initiated the conflict.</p>

However, anyone looking to sell should expect to receive 5% to 10% below the spot price from dealers and must pay taxes on the profit.

A sports media report, citing legal documents, claims the payment was funneled through a tree-planting service named Aspiration and was contingent on Leonard remaining with the team. An anonymous former employee claimed the deal was explicitly designed to circumvent league rules.

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have uncovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, an ankylosaur from over 165 million years ago, revealing a creature with extraordinary body armor. The dinosaur, roughly the size of a small car, possessed three-foot-long spikes on its neck, large spikes over its hips, and ribs fused with outward-projecting spikes, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. Scientists believe this elaborate armor was likely used for both defense against predators and for attracting mates. The discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting their defensive and display structures were more complex and developed earlier than previously thought.</p>

The article suggests that while President Trump has pushed for a quick resolution, Russia's fundamental demands—including territorial concessions and restrictions on Ukraine's sovereignty—remain largely unchanged and potentially unacceptable to Kyiv. Experts cited in the article argue that for Russian leadership, the conflict is viewed as an existential struggle with the West, making a true compromise difficult to achieve.

The odds of winning the grand prize are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. A data analysis shows that a winner's take-home amount varies significantly by state due to differing tax laws. States like Florida and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to keep more of the prize, while states like New York have the highest tax rates, resulting in the lowest after-tax payout.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has issued a preliminary list of 68 occupations that may be eligible for President Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction, set to take effect from 2025 through 2028. The provision allows qualifying workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income annually from their taxable income. The list, which includes roles like bartenders, restaurant servers, and hairstylists, will be officially published for public comment before being finalized. The tax break is designed to benefit a wide range of service industry professionals, though it phases out for individuals with higher incomes.</p>

          <p>A new cryptocurrency token co-founded by President Trump and his sons has begun public trading, highlighting ongoing concerns about the president personally profiting from his office. The venture, World Liberty Financial, reportedly gave the Trump family an on-paper windfall of around $5 billion at its launch. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have labeled the situation as "corruption," arguing it provides another avenue for those seeking influence to financially benefit the president. The White House has consistently denied any conflicts of interest, while the president has increasingly embraced the crypto industry after previously calling it a "scam." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative media outlet Newsmax has filed a federal lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the dominant network of using anti-competitive tactics to maintain an unlawful monopoly in the market for right-leaning news. The lawsuit alleges that Fox coerces pay-TV distributors into exclusionary agreements that marginalize or block rival channels, imposing financial penalties if they carry competitors like Newsmax. The complaint also claims Fox has engaged in intimidation tactics, including hiring private investigators to target Newsmax executives. Fox News dismissed the lawsuit, stating that Newsmax's struggles are due to its own competitive failures in the marketplace.</p>

His remains were recovered from the wreckage in 1957 but could not be identified at the time and were interred in Belgium.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court found that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion," rejecting the administration's argument that mass illegal migration constitutes such an event. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, blocking the use of this specific wartime statute for the migrants who brought the lawsuit.

Footage from the scene showed leveled buildings and smoldering rubble along the town's main road.
