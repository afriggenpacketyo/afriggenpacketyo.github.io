          <p>A major power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival in southeastern France, affecting approximately 160,000 households and threatening the closing ceremony. The outage, caused by a fire at an electrical substation and damage to a high-voltage line, prompted a police investigation into possible arson. Power was restored hours before the ceremony, allowing scheduled events to proceed as planned. Traffic lights and train services were disrupted, and many shops remained closed during the outage, but festival organizers ensured the Palais des Festivals had an independent power supply to continue operations.</p>

Dr. al-Najjar's husband and one child were injured but survived. The Israel Defense Forces stated that its aircraft struck "a number of suspects" operating from a structure near IDF troops in Khan Younis and that the claim of harm to uninvolved civilians is under review. The UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that people in Gaza were enduring what may be "the cruellest phase" of the war and denounced Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March, though the blockade was partially lifted earlier this week.</p>

          <p>Shoaib Bashir's impressive six-wicket haul secured a decisive victory for England against Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs within three days of their one-off Test match. Bashir's performance broke Zimbabwe's resistance, marking his best figures in Test cricket. Despite some lackluster seam bowling on the third morning, England capitalized on Bashir's talent, who became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets and the fourth to achieve three five-wicket hauls before the age of 22. Harry Brook's spectacular catch at second slip further contributed to England's triumph.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is rapidly emerging as a global competitor in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter. Analysts attribute On's success to its innovative products and strategic timing, capitalizing on Nike's declining sales and Adidas's partnership issues. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market, On's earnings growth rate has surpassed both companies in recent quarters. However, On faces potential challenges from Nike's turnaround plan and uncertainty regarding tariffs, as 90% of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency (A&E) departments. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to treat individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England said that the centers would reduce overcrowding in hospitals and relieve pressure on emergency services, including the police. While some centers will be new, self-contained units, others will be integrated into existing A&Es.</p>

          <p>The Catholic archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, made a rare court appearance in the archdiocese's bankruptcy case, which stems from hundreds of clergy sexual abuse claims. Aymond expressed concern for the survivors and acknowledged the bankruptcy has dragged on too long, preventing them from being compensated. Attorneys representing abuse claimants criticized a proposed settlement plan, calling it "dead on arrival," while the church and negotiating survivors say they need more time to finalize details. The proposed settlement would provide $130 million in cash and up to $110 million more from insurance carriers and potential church property sales.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the U.S.'s development of next-generation fighter jets and "loyal wingmen" drones could offset China's advantage in fleet size and extend operational range in the Indo-Pacific region. The US Air Force recently unveiled the YFQ-42A unmanned combat aerial vehicle, which is part of the collaborative combat aircraft program (CCA). The program aims to create drones that augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions.
