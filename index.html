            <p>Deborah Sampson, a woman from Plympton, Massachusetts, disguised herself as a man named Robert Shurtlieff to enlist in the Fourth Massachusetts Regiment during the Revolutionary War. She served for nearly two years, demonstrating bravery and skill in battle, even taking a musket ball to the thigh and extracting it herself to avoid revealing her secret. After contracting a fever, her true identity was discovered by a doctor who kept her secret until she was honorably discharged. Sampson later became the first woman to receive a military pension and embarked on a year-long lecture tour, sharing her experiences as a female soldier and defying societal norms of her time. The Deborah Sampson Act was passed in 2021 to provide women veterans with greater access to healthcare and resources.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to deport Venezuelans accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang without due process. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, ensuring detainees have a chance to argue their case in court, as previously mandated. The ACLU sued after learning that some detainees were given notices indicating they would be deported under the wartime law, citing concerns over their safety if deported to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison.</p>

            <p>A poll by the NASUWT teaching union in the UK indicates that social media influencers are contributing to increased misogyny and sexism in schools. Nearly three in five teachers believe social media negatively impacts student behavior, with Andrew Tate, a self-proclaimed misogynist, being cited by several teachers. Teachers have reported instances of young boys refusing to speak to female teachers due to Tate's views on women. The union is calling for concerted action involving schools, colleges, and other agencies to protect children from the influence of far-right populists and extremists.</p>

            <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a personal trainer, admitted to dangerous driving after a crash involving five police vehicles and his car injured seven officers. Azarbonyad was pursued by police after they noticed a defective rear light on his BMW, and he subsequently failed to stop. The incident occurred on the A1 near the Newcastle and Gateshead border, and Azarbonyad also admitted to driving without insurance and a license. Helicopter footage showed his vehicle nearly stopped when an unmarked police Volvo hit them at about 80mph, leading to a domino effect.</p>

            <p>Pardoned individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot are increasingly being welcomed as guest speakers at local Republican events across the country. Some are even considering running for office, capitalizing on their newfound status among a segment of the pro-Trump base. These individuals are often seen as patriots rather than criminals within these circles, with local GOP groups providing them a platform to share their version of events. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of political violence on the right, particularly when done in service of Trump and his election claims.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk, who has at least 14 children with four women, is reportedly brainstorming ways to breed his "legion" more efficiently, even considering the use of surrogates.

The article criticizes the gendered double standards that allow Musk to be seen as an eccentric genius despite his controversial behavior.

            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has condemned new US port fees targeting Chinese vessels as discriminatory and protectionist, vowing to retaliate. The US measures, finalized by the Trump administration, impose fees on Chinese-owned, operated, or built vessels docking in the United States. China argues that these fees harm Chinese companies, disrupt global supply chains, violate WTO rules, and undermine the international trade order. The fees are part of US efforts to bolster its domestic shipbuilding industry and curb Chinese dominance in the sector.</p>

            <p>According to experts, parents who raise successful readers often engage in specific practices early on, such as treating baby babble as conversation and asking questions to encourage thinking. They also emphasize letter sounds over names and shapes, play with words through rhymes and songs, and seize everyday opportunities to engage with reading. Strong reading skills in elementary school are a predictor of long-term success, leading to higher education, better jobs, and increased earnings. These practices aim to build a strong foundation for language development and literacy from an early age.</p>

            <p>The lifespan of $2 million in retirement savings varies dramatically across U.S. states due to differences in the cost of living. A recent analysis indicates that $2 million, combined with Social Security, could last from 23 years in Hawaii to 72 years in West Virginia. Housing costs are the primary driver of these disparities, with states like California and Massachusetts requiring significantly more savings to maintain a comparable lifestyle. The analysis considered typical retiree expenses, including groceries, housing, transportation, utilities, and healthcare, adjusting for each state's cost-of-living index.</p>

            <p>The White House's proposed budget cuts, including the cancellation of NASA's Mars sample return program, could allow China to take the lead in space exploration. China's Tianwen-3 mission aims to deliver Martian material to Earth by 2031, potentially becoming the sole mission in the race. This move raises concerns about weakening US leadership in space and prompting international partners to rethink their cooperation with the US, especially as China expands its ambitious space programs.</p>

            <p>The rising cost of hobbies, termed "hobby inflation," is making recreational activities increasingly exclusive and inaccessible to many. The article discusses how price increases in shooting, bourbon collecting, fishing, and other hobbies are outpacing regular inflation. This trend has social ramifications, as hobbies create social worlds that bring people from different backgrounds together.
