            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, often described as the "world's coolest dictator," visited President Trump at the White House, marking the first official invite to a Latin American leader since Trump took office. Bukele, a key regional ally, has enthusiastically supported Trump's anti-immigration policies, deporting hundreds of alleged gang members to El Salvador. Despite facing condemnation for human rights abuses, including mass arrests and incarcerations under a state of emergency, Bukele enjoys high approval ratings at home for reducing homicides, with Trump administration officials and MAGA Republicans showing strong support for his policies. Discussions at the White House are expected to cover further cooperation on migration, tariffs, and the potential detention of American criminals in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>Major stock markets in Asia and Europe experienced gains after the U.S. announced temporary exemptions from reciprocal tariffs on key consumer electronics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw significant growth, leading regional gains. However, President Trump indicated that these exemptions would be temporary, with specific tariffs to be imposed on goods under a new national security classification. Trump emphasized that no country would be exempt from addressing unfair trade balances and non-monetary tariff barriers, particularly China, as the U.S. is reviewing semiconductors and the entire electronics supply chain under upcoming national security tariff investigations.

            <p>A report by UK Members of Parliament (MPs) examined the policing response to riots that erupted following the murder of three children in Southport last summer. The report found that police forces were often unprepared for the violence, which included attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers and mosques. While acknowledging the severity of the disorder, the report found no evidence of "two-tier policing," stating that the police response was appropriate given the violence and criminality. The MPs commended the bravery and professionalism of officers, many of whom were injured, and highlighted the role of misinformation in fueling the unrest.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second time in 2025, as the city-state anticipates the possibility of zero growth this year after experiencing a lower-than-expected GDP expansion of 3.8% in the first quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded its GDP forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, citing declines in manufacturing and some services sectors. Concerns over sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S. and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war have contributed to the downgraded outlook, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore reducing the rate of appreciation of its policy band.

            <p>A man sparked a social media debate after sharing his decision to stop driving when his wife is in the car due to her constant criticism and backseat driving. The man explained that he becomes angry and moody when she criticizes his driving, leading him to insist she drive instead. While his wife initially complied, she later asked him to share the driving responsibilities, which led to renewed criticism and his refusal to drive again. Psychologists suggest that creating boundaries around driving is reasonable, especially if a partner's behavior is emotionally dysregulating and potentially unsafe, and that mutual respect is essential for shared responsibility.</p>

            <p>Sony has increased the price of its PlayStation 5 console in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, citing a "challenging economic environment" including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. The price increase affects the PS5 Digital Edition, while the PS5 with a HD Blu-ray disk drive remains unchanged in Europe and the U.K. The company attributed the "tough decision" to the backdrop of a volatile global financial and currency market, particularly following President Trump's announcement of "reciprocal tariffs". Analysts anticipate that Sony may also raise PS5 prices in the U.S. eventually, once the direction of tariffs becomes clearer. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant jump in March, exceeding expectations due to businesses frontloading shipments to avoid anticipated U.S. tariffs. Exports increased by 12.4% in U.S. dollar terms, marking the largest jump since October of the previous year. However, imports declined by 4.3%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. As the U.S. imposes cumulative tariffs on all imports from China, China has retaliated with tit-for-tat tariff increases, creating uncertainty for businesses adjusting supply chains. The Chinese leadership has set an ambitious annual growth target of "around 5%" this year, facing challenges from the escalating trade war and lackluster domestic consumption.

            <p>A retrial has commenced in Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times, stemming from a 2017 editorial that falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting. Palin alleges that the editorial damaged her reputation and career. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but claims it was an "honest mistake" that was quickly corrected. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the case after the original ruling was rejected, citing flaws in the initial trial. The retrial occurs amid a climate of heightened aggression toward media outlets by President Trump and his supporters.</p>

            <h2>Goldman Sachs Argues ESG Investors Should Reconsider Oil and Gas Stocks</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 01:16:47 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG investors should re-evaluate their approach to oil and gas companies, similar to how many fund managers reconsidered defense policy after the Russia-Ukraine war. The analyst, Michele Della Vigna, argues that a persistent unwillingness to own energy majors is a "major mistake" in evaluating the energy transition. Della Vigna outlines three reasons why ESG investors should consider oil and gas stocks, including the longer-than-expected energy transition, the role of oil and gas companies as major investors in low-carbon energy, and their capabilities as "market makers" and "risk-takers".

            <p>Baby boomers and first-time travelers are driving a "coolcations" trend, shunning Europe's summer hotspots for cooler climes like the Nordic and Baltic countries. Concerns about extreme heat, cost, and overcrowding are influencing vacation choices. Intrepid Travel has seen a 50% increase in bookings to Iceland, Estonia, and Scandinavia for July-August, while bookings to southern Europe have shifted to shoulder seasons. The trend reflects a conscious decision to avoid intense summer heat and wildfires, with travelers opting for more temperate destinations or traveling to hotspots during spring and autumn.</p>

            <p>Tenants on the Nags Head Estate in east London have enlisted lawyers and health workers from Medact to fight against Peabody, a housing association, over long-standing issues of damp and mould in their homes. The tenants blame the conditions for health problems, including respiratory illnesses. A survey by Medact found high rates of visible mould and damp in the properties, with many households reporting new symptoms or injuries since moving in. Peabody said it had invested over £1m on improvements but acknowledged that it would take time to resolve all the issues.</p>

She stated that while she appreciates clever and spirited parodies, the SNL sketch "punched down" on her and relied on a cheap joke about fluoride.
