        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five Texas district attorneys are suing Attorney General Ken Paxton over new rules granting his office broad access to their case records. The DAs argue the rule, effective since April, is an unconstitutional overreach violating separation of powers and imposing unnecessary burdens on county prosecutors. Paxton claims the provision is a way to "rein in rogue district attorneys" allegedly refusing to uphold the law. The lawsuits seek to block Paxton from enforcing the rule, citing potential expenses and violations of state and federal law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Casey Michel, in an opinion piece for the New York Times, argues that the Trump family is exploiting the presidency for financial gain through foreign deals and access peddling. The article draws parallels to Hunter Biden's past dealings, suggesting a broader pattern of politicians profiting from their positions. Michel criticizes Trump for dismantling counter-kleptocracy measures and calls for legislation to prevent family members of high-ranking officials from engaging in foreign lobbying or deals. The article also highlights the Clinton Foundation's past acceptance of funds from questionable regimes, painting a picture of widespread corruption in American politics. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards, in a New York Times guest essay, contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance rail travel in the United States. Europe's revitalized night train network competes with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns and EU infrastructure plans. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces slashed funding for public infrastructure and a preference for cars and air travel, leading to congestion and environmental damage. The article advocates for investment in rail networks and subway systems as a way to improve transportation and quality of life in America.</p>

Chinese financiers would contribute 40% of the funds needed to build a railway in Kenya, and Chinese contractors would have exclusive rights to construct and operate the railway for a minimum of 25 years after completion to recoup their investment through toll fees.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charge current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. The changes aim to address a $12 billion state budget deficit, attributed to President Donald Trump's tariffs, rising drug costs, and increased healthcare utilization among seniors. The plan would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19, while those with "unsatisfactory" status would face the monthly fee. These policies are expected to save California $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year.</p>

The commerce ministry's findings conclude a probe launched in May 2024, shortly after the U.S. sharply increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, computer chips and other imports. The highest anti-dumping rates of 74.9% were levied on imports from the United States, while European shipments will face 34.5% duties. The move comes amid rising hopes that the U.S.-China trade war is easing.</p>

          <p>Elton John has criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling them "absolute losers" and feeling "incredibly betrayed." He believes this move would allow AI firms to use artists' content without payment, amounting to "theft" and robbing young artists of their legacy and income. The government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programs. The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to "wise up" and described Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as "a bit of a moron."</p>

The last time Chicago was affected by a significant dust storm was during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. Soil moisture in the area was at only 2 to 5 percent, making it among the driest ever.</p>
