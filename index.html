          <p>Former President Trump has voiced doubts about arranging a one-on-one meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suggesting a three-way talk involving himself is more likely. This comes amidst Ukraine's frustration with Russia's perceived lack of constructive engagement in peace negotiations, as Russian forces continue their offensive across the 620-mile front line. Recent large-scale aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia, highlight the ongoing conflict and its devastating impact on civilians. Ukraine's European allies accuse Putin of delaying serious peace efforts while advancing militarily, further complicating any potential diplomatic resolution.</p>

No injuries were reported in this specific shooting, but the victims residing in the home have not cooperated with authorities, leaving the motive unclear.

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," an executive order aimed at resisting the potential deployment of federal agents by the Trump administration to the city. The order seeks to protect residents' rights, bar federal agents from wearing masks, and require clear identification, amidst "highly credible reports" of impending militarized federal activity. Johnson emphasized that Chicago will pursue all legal avenues to oppose actions violating residents' constitutional rights, particularly concerning immigration enforcement and protest. The White House, however, dismissed the order as a "publicity stunt," urging local officials to focus on crime rather than criticizing the President.</p>

          <p>The temporary South Florida Detention Facility, controversially dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is being shut down by the Department of Homeland Security following a judge's order. Families of former detainees have reported severe medical neglect and denial of legal access, with one inmate allegedly left bleeding after surgery and another disappearing from the ICE locator system. While some Republicans praised the facility's conditions, Democrats described them as "vile and unsanitary," highlighting the deep divisions over Trump's immigration policies. Despite the closure of this specific site, other temporary facilities are being built in Republican-led states, indicating a continued push for increased detention infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>US Body Broker Industry Faces Scrutiny Over Ethical Concerns and Exploitation</h2>

          <p>The US body broker industry, which profits from acquiring, dissecting, and selling human body parts for medical research, is under intense scrutiny due to a lack of regulation and allegations of exploitation. Families, like that of Harold Dillard, have reported horrific experiences, including bodies being "mutilated" and receiving questionable ashes. Unlike most European countries, US law allows companies to charge "reasonable amounts" for "processing," creating a loophole for for-profit trade. Critics argue this system is ripe for abuse, turning altruistic donations into a lucrative, unregulated business, while advocates emphasize its role in medical advancement.</p>

          <p>New government data from England indicates that pupils who were partially absent during the first week of September 2024 were significantly more likely to become "persistently absent" later in the school year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize full attendance at the start of the 2025 term, emphasizing that every missed school day impacts a child's future. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains higher than pre-Covid levels, prompting concerns about the "life chances of a whole generation." Headteachers highlight ongoing challenges like unauthorized term-time holidays and the need for broader support beyond school gates.</p>

Ernst, the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran, was initially elected in 2014. Her decision is expected to open up a fierce Senate race, with Representative Ashley Hinson already reportedly eyeing the seat. Despite a recent special election win for Democrats in Iowa, the party has not won a U.S. Senate race in the state since 2008, setting the stage for a competitive contest.</p>

The policy has sparked controversy among some shoppers but is part of a broader trend of changes, including a recent shift from Pepsi to exclusively Coca-Cola products in food courts.

Del Toro emphasized his commitment to practical effects over CGI and his aim to humanize the monster, asking, "what is it to be human?" While some critics lauded it as "epic-scale storytelling of uncommon beauty," others found it "all show and little substance," sparking varied reactions to this latest interpretation of Mary Shelley's classic.</p>

Modern forensic science, including a new autopsy and blood splatter analysis, indicates Pauline was shot outside the vehicle and Pusser's own cheek wound was likely self-inflicted.

          <p>Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley, but manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged persistent goalkeeping errors that continue to plague his team. Recent mistakes by both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have led to conceded goals, creating a "difficult moment" for the club's goalkeepers. Amorim confirmed that United is exploring options, including Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, to address these issues. The win provides a temporary reprieve for Amorim amidst a turbulent week, but significant challenges remain, especially with upcoming matches against strong opponents like Manchester City and Chelsea.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that most of President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs," including those on Mexico, Canada, and China, are illegal, asserting he overstepped presidential authority. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president power to impose such broad tariffs, stating this authority rests with Congress. While Trump plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, the ruling casts significant uncertainty over a central tenet of his economic agenda. However, sector-specific tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum, remain unaffected and are likely to continue.</p>

          <p>A fatal traffic accident early Saturday morning closed parts of Alligator Alley near the Collier County line for several hours. The crash occurred when a pickup truck hauling a boat struck a road construction crash truck, which then collided with a paint-striping vehicle. The driver of the crash truck was flown to a hospital and later died from their injuries. The incident, which happened around 1:40 AM, disrupted travel to Florida's east coast on a long holiday weekend, but all lanes were reopened by 1 PM after investigation and scene clearance.</p>

          <p>Experts continue to debate and offer recommendations on safe screen time for children, acknowledging the lack of uniform international rules and the rapid evolution of technology. While the World Health Organization suggests no more than one hour daily for children aged two and above, German guidelines recommend "screen-free until age three." Psychologists and pediatricians emphasize that excessive screen time can hinder motor skill development, social interaction, and language acquisition, replacing crucial real-world exploration. They advocate for supervised use, content awareness, and parental role-modeling, recognizing technology's potential benefits when integrated thoughtfully into a child's life.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has warned that President Trump's efforts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could jeopardize the central bank's independence. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed risks eroding its legitimacy and could lead to negative long-term economic consequences, drawing parallels to countries that have lost institutional integrity. She predicts that such actions could initially boost markets but ultimately result in sustained higher inflation, a weakened dollar, and increased gold prices, emphasizing the importance of the Fed's autonomy for economic stability (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish has found a new lease on his career at Everton, delivering back-to-back man-of-the-match performances and earning high praise from manager David Moyes. After a season spent largely on Manchester City's bench, Grealish has registered multiple assists and showcased his "maverick" talent, making him the first Everton player to achieve consecutive multi-assist Premier League appearances. Moyes attributes Grealish's upturn in form to his mentality and the opportunity for consistent playing time. Despite being omitted from the latest England squad, his resurgence raises questions about his potential return to international football ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly demanded the resignation of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of "endangering the health of the American people" through his anti-vaccine advocacy and promotion of conspiracy theories. Sanders' op-ed in the New York Times highlights recent chaos at US health agencies, including the firing of CDC director Susan Monarez and subsequent resignations. He warns that Kennedy's "war on science" could undermine public health, making it harder for Americans to access life-saving vaccines and potentially leading to the resurgence of eradicated diseases. This call joins growing bipartisan pushback against Kennedy's policies.</p>
