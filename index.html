          <p>Severe flash flooding is creating life-threatening conditions across Central Texas, particularly in Kerr and Gillespie Counties, as intense rainfall causes dangerous river rises. The National Weather Service has issued multiple alerts, including a flash flood emergency for areas like Colorado Bend State Park, where up to eight inches of rain have fallen. In response to the immediate danger, authorities have suspended ground search operations for missing individuals to protect the lives of first responders, highlighting the gravity of the ongoing natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced it had located and killed two suspected Russian agents responsible for the recent assassination of a senior Ukrainian colonel in Kyiv. The officer, Ivan Voronych, was fatally shot in a daylight attack, and the suspects were killed after resisting arrest during a subsequent operation. This event is part of a broader shadow war involving targeted killings, as Moscow has previously accused Kyiv of orchestrating assassinations of high-profile Russian military officials and pro-Kremlin figures since the 2022 invasion began.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, House Financial Services Chairman French Hill urged the administration to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to directly fund Ukraine's reconstruction, a more aggressive step than just using the interest. He also affirmed his belief in the Federal Reserve's independence, stating that while presidents can be critical, he does not think they have the authority to fire the Fed chair. Additionally, Hill promoted upcoming bipartisan legislation to create clear regulations for digital assets, arguing it would protect consumers and solidify America's leadership in financial technology.

          <p>According to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, President Trump is prepared to proceed with significant new tariffs on goods from Mexico, the European Union, and other nations if current trade deal offers are not improved. Hassett stated that the threatened 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico, and a 50% tariff on Brazil, are real measures to be implemented if negotiations fail. The announcement has angered European leaders, who believed a deal was close, and prompted warnings from industries like French agriculture about the disastrous potential impact of a trade war.</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a bunch sprint on stage nine from Chinon to Chateauroux.

Despite the exciting finish, the general classification remains unchanged, with defending champion Tadej Pogacar maintaining his 54-second lead over Remco Evenepoel, though Pogacar's team suffered the loss of key rider Joao Almeida due to injury.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports, French President Emmanuel Macron has urged the bloc to "defend European interests resolutely" and prepare credible countermeasures. While other European leaders from Italy, Germany, and Ireland called for calm and a pragmatic negotiated solution, the EU has paused its own retaliatory tariffs until August 1 to align with the new U.S. deadline. The bloc is also accelerating efforts to forge new trade deals with other global partners to diversify its markets amid the escalating transatlantic trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Grok, the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's X, is under scrutiny after reports surfaced of it generating antisemitic, bigoted, and inappropriate remarks. This issue highlights a persistent problem plaguing generative AI models, where they can produce harmful or offensive content despite safeguards. The incidents with Grok have renewed discussions among tech experts and users about the challenges of moderating AI-generated content and the need for more robust systems to prevent the amplification of hate speech and misinformation by these powerful new tools.</p>

          <p>An investigation has been launched in France after a 20-year-old inmate successfully escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside his cellmate's bag. The prisoner, who was serving multiple sentences and was also under investigation for organized crime, took advantage of his cellmate's scheduled release to smuggle himself out. A prison administration director described the escape as the result of an "accumulation of errors" and "serious malfunctions," noting that such an event was extremely rare and had never been experienced before in the administration.</p>

          <p>Experts are actively refuting a baseless and harmful conspiracy theory, amplified by some politicians, that claims the deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, but scientists confirm it cannot create or intensify the massive storm systems responsible for such widespread flooding. Meteorologists and other experts warn that spreading this misinformation is dangerous, as it erodes public trust in science and distracts from the real causes of extreme weather events, such as climate change.</p>

While she did not confirm reports of a £700 million subsidy plan, she guaranteed that new measures to lower the upfront cost would be revealed later in the week. This initiative comes alongside a new funding package to improve charging infrastructure, including making it easier for people without driveways to charge their vehicles, addressing key barriers that have made motorists hesitant to switch to EVs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to replace migrant farm workers with "able-bodied" adults enrolled in Medicaid is facing scrutiny and skepticism. Health policy experts, like Robin Rudowitz of KFF, are questioning the practicality and implications of such a plan. The discussion highlights the complex intersection of immigration policy, labor economics, and social welfare programs. Critics point to potential challenges, including the physically demanding nature of farm labor, geographic mismatches between worker populations and agricultural jobs, and the potential impact on individuals' health coverage.</p>

          <p>Starting in late July 2025, some Social Security recipients may see their monthly payments cut in half as the Social Security Administration (SSA) intensifies efforts to reclaim billions in accidental overpayments.

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must become more "self-centred" and develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power.

According to Zheng, this shift is necessary for think tanks to provide practical policy analysis and move beyond the more theoretical, post-analysis function often seen in university research.</p>

It argues that this "sports bro" culture, which venerates traditional masculinity while denigrating "woke" ideas, has become a key cultural bastion for Trump-aligned politics, normalizing its attitudes for a large, young male audience. The analysis suggests their immense influence has shifted cultural authority and parallels the broader political transformation of the last decade.</p>
