          <p>Following a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he will travel to Washington D.C. for a meeting. The announcement came after a lengthy phone call between Trump and Zelenskyy, where European leaders also participated. The Alaska summit concluded without a final deal to end the war, with Trump stating that significant points remain unresolved and urging Zelenskyy to "make the deal." Ongoing military exchanges continue, with Russia launching missile and drone strikes across Ukraine overnight.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all its flights, affecting an estimated 130,000 passengers daily, as over 10,000 flight attendants initiated a 72-hour strike. The union is demanding higher salaries and pay for ground time, rejecting the airline's offer of a 38% compensation increase over four years as insufficient. The industrial action has led to the cancellation of approximately 500 flights per day, with picketing planned at major Canadian airports. The airline expressed deep regret for the disruption while the union criticized its lack of good-faith negotiation.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors have significantly altered the landscape of Athens, primarily through the "golden visa" program, which offers residency in exchange for real estate investment. As of June 2025, Chinese citizens constitute the largest group of participants, accounting for nearly 48% of all first-time permit holders in the scheme. They also represent 61% of those who have renewed their five-year visas, indicating a long-term presence. This influx of investment has led to thousands of property acquisitions by Chinese buyers, quietly transforming the Greek capital's real estate market.</p>

Trump stated that while "great progress" was made, they "didn't get there," leaving key sticking points unresolved. Following the summit, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced he would travel to Washington for further discussions. Putin maintained his position that the "root causes" of the conflict must be addressed, a stance Ukraine rejects as a demand for territorial concessions.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have expressed escalating concerns about the sustainability of Washington's expanding national debt, fueling calls for Beijing to reduce its exposure to U.S. dollar assets. While acknowledging U.S. Treasuries have not defaulted, the researchers argue the current trajectory of debt expansion is untenable. China has already been trimming its holdings, which are at their lowest level since 2009. The article suggests a strategy of gradually adjusting Treasury holdings while increasing reserves of gold and other strategic materials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis posits that Russian President Vladimir Putin was the clear winner of the Alaska summit, gaining a global spotlight and a red carpet welcome without conceding to a ceasefire. The article argues that Donald Trump received little in return, failing to secure an end to hostilities while providing Putin with a significant propaganda victory. For Ukraine, the outcome is seen as a loss, as the conflict continues and American support appears increasingly conditional. The summit is framed as a signal to European allies that they may need to rely more on their own resources to support Ukraine.</p>

The article highlights Putin's endorsement of Trump's claims about the 2020 election and the war in Ukraine, suggesting a shared authoritarian worldview. It criticizes the pageantry of the event, which treated a leader accused of war crimes involving murder and sexual assault to a red carpet welcome.

          <p>This article outlines five main takeaways from the meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, emphasizing that no ceasefire agreement was reached. A key point is that the summit itself was a victory for Putin, welcoming him back to the world stage despite international isolation. The analysis notes that Putin's statement after the talks reiterated maximalist demands for peace, indicating no change in Moscow's position. Conversely, Trump's remarks were vague, lacking specifics on progress and avoiding any mention of the "severe consequences" he had previously threatened.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is proposing new residency regulations that would require mainland Chinese spouses to prove they have relinquished their Chinese household registration and passport. The policy, championed by President Lai, is part of a broader strategy to address perceived security risks from Beijing, including societal infiltration and identity ambiguity. This move marks a significant shift in cross-strait residency governance. Applicants would need to provide notarized proof of renunciation or have their Chinese passport physically invalidated to be eligible for residency.</p>
