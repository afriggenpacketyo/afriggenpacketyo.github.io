          <h2>Trump to Sign Executive Order Aiming to Lower Drug Costs by Matching International Prices</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order on Monday to lower some U.S. drug prices by aligning them with the lowest prices paid by other economically advanced countries, reviving a policy from his first term. This "most favored nation" pricing model aims to lower costs for medications administered in doctor's offices and covered by Medicare, but it will likely face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The industry argues that such measures would stifle innovation and reduce investment in research and development, while Trump asserts that the U.S. is being exploited by higher drug prices compared to other nations. A similar order signed during his first term was blocked by the courts.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is reportedly considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, potentially to be transferred to his presidential library after his term. This has ignited ethical debates and scrutiny over possible violations of the Emoluments Clause, with concerns raised about foreign influence and transparency. While Qatari officials have confirmed discussions about the potential transfer, they deny that a final decision has been made or that the plane will be gifted during Trump's upcoming visit. The plan has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs, who question the legality and appropriateness of accepting such a substantial gift from a foreign government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports of entry due to the spread of New World Screwworm (NWS) in Mexico. The USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the measure to prevent the devastating pest from entering the United States, where it could harm livestock. The suspension will continue on a month-to-month basis until containment is achieved, with the U.S. and Mexico collaborating on eradication efforts through surveillance, treatment, and sterile insect dispersal.

          <p>Oren and Tal Alexander, prominent real estate moguls, along with their brother Alon, are facing new federal charges, including additional counts of alleged sexual trafficking, with one involving a minor. The superseding indictment includes six alleged victims and claims that Alon and Tal Alexander should have recognized that one of the victims was underage. The brothers have pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, and their attorneys claim the new charges are without merit, with Alon's attorney highlighting his client's willingness to take a polygraph.

          <p>Taiwanese authorities have removed the "Han Chinese" category from the official information page of the Executive Yuan, classifying them as "other population," a move criticized by the KMT as a "denial of history." This change, made on March 24, categorizes the majority Han Chinese population as "other population," while emphasizing the island's indigenous identity. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan’s ruling party, is intensifying efforts to distance the island from mainland China and promote its distinct identity. The Executive Yuan did not publicly announce the change, which was spotted by Taiwanese media outlets.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal health care system, lauded for affordability and supporting a long-lived population, is facing increasing strain due to a shrinking workforce and an aging population, leading to its entanglement in political maneuvering. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly through medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased costs for high medical cost patients. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and public trust, necessitating a measured debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures. The government has since frozen all envisioned hikes following talks with patient advocates.</p>

          <p>The first head-to-head trial of two blockbuster weight-loss drugs has shown Mounjaro is more effective than rival Wegovy. Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction, after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeded the 14% from Wegovy, according to the trial's findings. Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.</p>

          <h2>Head-to-Head Trial Shows Mounjaro More Effective Than Wegovy for Weight Loss</h2>

          <p>A direct comparison of the weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese participants and showed that those on Mounjaro also experienced greater waistline reduction and improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels. While both drugs had similar side effects, researchers suggest that Mounjaro may be more beneficial for individuals with significant weight to lose. Both drugs work by mimicking hormones that induce feelings of fullness, but Mounjaro targets two appetite switches in the brain, while Wegovy targets only one.</p>

          <p>The selection of Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Edward Martin, has triggered a mixed wave of reactions. While some Democrats criticize Pirro's ardent loyalty to Trump and past election fraud claims, others celebrate the removal of Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate. The U.S. Attorney for D.C. has a unique portfolio, including federal corruption cases and local criminal prosecutions, and Pirro will need to shift from her provocative TV pronouncements to uphold Justice Department traditions. Some Republicans support Pirro, while others remain cautious about her ability to handle the complexities of the role.</p>

          <p>California, despite being the world's fourth-largest economy, is facing significant economic, political, social, and environmental challenges. The state is grappling with the aftermath of wildfires, a potential population decline, and a billion-dollar budget shortfall in Los Angeles. The Trump administration's adversarial stance towards California exacerbates these issues, making it difficult for the state to secure federal assistance. While some leaders remain optimistic about California's resilience, the state faces rising homelessness, struggling public schools, and an increasingly expensive cost of living, particularly for younger and lower-income residents.</p>
