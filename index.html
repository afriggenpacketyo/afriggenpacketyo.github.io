          <p>House Republicans are holding a critical procedural vote on a massive domestic policy bill championed by former President Trump, facing significant opposition from within their own party. Holdouts from both the conservative House Freedom Caucus and moderate factions have raised concerns over the bill's contents, which passed the Senate by a narrow margin. Speaker Mike Johnson is actively working to secure the necessary votes, with the party's slim majority leaving little room for defections on the high-stakes legislation.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is burning out of control on the Greek island of Crete, forcing the evacuation of approximately 1,500 people from homes and tourist areas near Ierapetra. Fanned by strong winds, the blaze has destroyed properties and created hazardous conditions, with authorities closing roads and placing local hospitals on alert. Firefighting efforts are being hampered by rugged terrain and difficult weather, with reinforcements being sent to the island to battle the extensive fire front.</p>
