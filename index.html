          <p>Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon men's singles championship, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in four sets. The victory marks a redemption for Sinner, who had lost to Alcaraz just five weeks prior in an epic French Open final. The match between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 players was the first time the same men contested both the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year since the Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal rivalry. This win adds a third major trophy to Sinner's collection.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump reveals that the Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources during his 2024 campaign. The report details a "cascade of errors" and communication failures, including the denial of requests for counter-snipers and drone countermeasures for rallies prior to the Butler, Pennsylvania event. The investigation accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials, a claim she disputes, and concludes the tragedy was preventable.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly in the final stages of securing a deal with Sporting Lisbon to sign Swedish forward Viktor Gyokeres for a fee around €70 million. Negotiations between the two clubs are at an advanced stage, with Gyokeres having already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract. The 27-year-old, who scored an impressive 54 goals in 52 games last season, failed to report for pre-season training with Sporting, leading to disciplinary action from the Portuguese club. The move is expected to be finalized swiftly once the clubs agree on the final details.</p>

Cantwell argues that enhanced federal investment in weather science and data analytics, managed by agencies like NOAA, can provide more advance warning and save lives, pointing to successful tornado predictions in the Midwest.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to fill water containers, according to Gazan emergency officials. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating that a "technical error" caused a munition targeting an Islamic Jihad militant to miss its target by several dozen meters. The IDF expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians and has opened a review into the strike. The event occurred amid an escalation of Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip and has been condemned by international aid organizations.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 floods in Kerr County, Texas, were suspended Sunday due to a new flood threat. With at least 161 people still missing, emergency crews were forced to evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor as the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the area. The original flood, which caused the river to swell dramatically, killed at least 129 people statewide. The ongoing difficult weather and terrain continue to complicate the massive search effort involving local, state, and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has affirmed that President Trump is prepared to proceed with threatened tariffs on Mexico and the European Union if improved trade deals are not reached. Hassett stated that the tariffs, including a 30% rate on EU and Mexican goods starting August 1, are not merely a negotiating tactic. The announcement has angered European leaders, who are now working to find a solution before the deadline. The German chancellor noted the significant potential impact on his country's economy but stressed the need for dialogue while not ruling out countermeasures.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's proposed 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a broader global strategy to onshore production and address national security risks posed by trade deficits.

The defense comes as the administration's aggressive tariff policies continue to create friction with major trading partners, including the European Union and Mexico.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against growing criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Critics, including prominent conservative figures, have accused Bondi of withholding information after a Justice Department memo failed to reveal a rumored "client list." In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job" and not waste energy on the Epstein case. The situation has highlighted a reported division between the DOJ and the FBI over the investigation.</p>

          <p>The dispute between FIFA and the global players' union, Fifpro, has intensified despite FIFA's announcement supporting mandatory rest periods for players. While FIFA committed to a 72-hour gap between games and a three-week summer break, Fifpro executives were reportedly not present at the meeting where the decision was made, describing the process as flawed. The conflict is fueled by concerns over player welfare, particularly with the launch of an expanded 32-team Club World Cup, which the union argues was implemented without proper consultation, leading to a lawsuit against the governing body.</p>

          <p>Years before 27 children died in the catastrophic Texas floods, U.S. regulators reportedly approved appeals to remove numerous buildings at Camp Mystic from official high-risk flood maps. According to media reports citing official records, the camp, located by the Guadalupe River, had successfully challenged a 2011 FEMA designation that would have required stricter building regulations and flood insurance. This revelation raises serious questions about the regulatory process and whether the re-designation contributed to the tragic loss of life when floodwaters inundated the camp on July 4.</p>
