          <p>Three police officers in Lorain, Ohio, were injured after a gunman opened fire in what authorities described as a premeditated "ambush situation." The suspect had parked at a dead end and was reportedly lying in wait with an arsenal of weapons, including a high-powered rifle. He shot two officers as they sat in their patrol vehicles and a third officer who responded to the call for backup. All three officers were hospitalized with gunshot wounds, with two requiring airlift for treatment, while the 28-year-old suspect was shot and killed by police at the scene.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new AI Action Plan designed to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence and fast-track its development. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions aimed at supporting infrastructure like data centers and the electric grid, and establishing rules for government contractors to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems. It also seeks to compel federal agencies to repeal rules that obstruct AI development and to withhold funding from states with what it calls "burdensome" regulations. The initiative is part of an effort to remove guardrails imposed by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against right-wing influencer Candace Owens. The suit addresses claims spread by Owens that the first lady was born male, allegations the Macrons' attorneys called "outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions." Owens has repeatedly made these claims on her podcast and social media, staking her professional reputation on them. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, states that Owens disregarded credible evidence and seeks unspecified damages after she refused requests for a retraction.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of past research suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is associated with significant health benefits, challenging the more common 10,000-step goal. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research found that a 7,000-step count was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and a 38% lower risk of dementia compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The study also noted reduced risks for heart disease, cancer mortality, and type 2 diabetes. The authors suggest that 7,000 steps may be a more realistic and achievable public health target for many individuals.</p>

          <p>This article provides a six-month review of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies, characterized as a "shock and awe" campaign. Since returning to office, the president has moved swiftly to enact the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history, backed by tens of billions in new funding for domestic enforcement. The report highlights how these actions fulfill campaign promises and represent a dramatic, rapid upending of decades of federal immigration policy. The piece from NPR's "Consider This" podcast examines the significant changes and their impact during the first half-year of the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not about monetary policy but a dangerous push for "fiscal dominance." The author contends that the administration wants to subordinate the central bank to fund its own fiscal agenda, a move characteristic of unstable economies that historically leads to inflation and stagnation. While acknowledging Powell's past policy missteps, the piece asserts that caving to political pressure for lower interest rates would erode confidence in U.S. Treasuries. The article concludes the real problem is excessive government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM shares fell in extended trading despite the company reporting second-quarter results that surpassed overall Wall Street projections for earnings and revenue. The stock's decline was attributed to the company's software revenue, which, while growing 10%, slightly missed analyst consensus estimates. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients reprioritized spending toward hardware and that geopolitical tensions are causing cautiousness. The company's infrastructure and consulting segments both beat revenue expectations, and IBM reaffirmed its full-year guidance for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 16% year-over-year decline in second-quarter automotive revenue, with both overall revenue and earnings per share falling short of analysts' estimates.

A key factor discussed on the earnings call was the negative impact of a new federal bill that repeals the $7,500 EV tax credit, which could limit vehicle supply in the U.S. for the remainder of the year.

The next day, at least one of the grenades detonated at a training facility, killing three veteran detectives in the deadliest incident for the department in over 150 years.

          <p>A coalition of over 100 international aid and human rights organizations, including Oxfam and Save the Children, has issued a dire warning of mass starvation in Gaza. In a joint statement, the groups report that a quarter of the population faces famine-like conditions, with record rates of acute malnutrition among children and the elderly. They state that the Israeli siege has depleted all supplies, forcing even aid workers into food lines. The organizations are pressing for immediate international action, including a permanent ceasefire and the full opening of all land crossings to restore a UN-led humanitarian response.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'OK' Traces its Origins to a 19th-Century Joke and a Presidential Campaign</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the word "OK," one of the most widely understood terms on the planet. Its origin is traced back to a linguistic fad in 1830s Boston, where it first appeared in print as a jocular abbreviation for "oll korrect" (all correct). The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," a nod to his nickname "Old Kinderhook." The word's simplicity and versatility allowed it to spread globally, becoming a staple of communication from telegraphs to modern text messages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has stated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on home sales as a measure to boost the housing market. Under current law, profits from a primary home sale are taxed once they exceed $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The proposal follows the introduction of a bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to achieve the same goal. While proponents argue it would unlock equity and help fix housing shortages, some experts believe a complete elimination is unlikely and that raising the existing exemption threshold is a more probable outcome.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its focus on what it terms "woke" artificial intelligence, driven by a belief that AI models exhibit a left-leaning ideological bias. As part of a new action plan, the White House intends to revise federal guidelines to remove references to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and will require government contractors to ensure their AI systems permit free expression. This move reframes AI safety through a culture war lens, a reversal from the previous administration's focus on preventing AI from perpetuating bias.

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, is backing legislation to exempt U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods. The bill, named the CANADA Act, comes as the administration threatens a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian imports starting August 1. Proponents argue the tariffs harm small businesses that rely on cross-border trade, driving up costs and threatening jobs in states with close economic ties to Canada. The legislation specifically targets tariffs announced in February and aims to alleviate their economic impact on smaller enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece details how the MAGA right became obsessed with the case while ignoring Trump's own documented ties to Epstein.

Internal data shows nearly 150,000 deportations in the first six months, projecting an annual total over 300,000. While this would be the highest tally in over a decade, it remains far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting operational constraints.
