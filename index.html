          <p>China's government has introduced a one-year initiative to subsidize interest on personal consumer loans, aiming to boost household spending and support the economy. The plan, effective from September, will cover one percentage point of annual interest on loans for purchases like cars and education. This measure is part of a wider government strategy to unlock domestic demand, which also includes a significant allocation for a consumer goods trade-in program. Authorities will evaluate the program's effectiveness after a year to decide on a potential extension.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced the state will proceed with redrawing its electoral maps, targeting five new Democratic-leaning seats. This move is a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas, which Democrats argue constitute a partisan power grab. Newsom had previously stated a preference for independent commissions but declared that California could not remain passive. The action follows a tense political battle, with Newsom adopting a mocking tone toward Donald Trump on social media.</p>

The discussion occurred just days before Putin's scheduled meeting with Donald Trump in Alaska, during which Putin briefed Kim on the summit's preparations. This deepening alliance has seen North Korea supply Russia with soldiers, missiles, and labor, highlighting Moscow's increasing reliance on Pyongyang amid its diplomatic isolation from the West.</p>

He became the first player in over 60 years to homer in his first road plate appearance against a former team with whom he won multiple championships.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season later this week. As of Tuesday evening, the storm was located far from the U.S. but was expected to become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. The storm has already caused flooding and at least eight fatalities in the Cabo Verde islands off the African coast. Forecasters note uncertainty in its long-term path, but current models suggest it will pivot north, away from the U.S. mainland.</p>

Defense officials clarified that the Guard, operating under Title 32 authority, will support federal law enforcement rather than conduct direct policing, though they can make arrests.

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's jailed former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested following allegations of stock manipulation, bribery, and meddling in elections. A court issued a detention warrant, citing the risk of evidence destruction. Prosecutors accuse Kim of earning over $577,000 through a stock price-rigging scheme and accepting luxury items as bribes. This marks the first time in the country's history that both a former president and first lady have been incarcerated, highlighting ongoing political turmoil.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion bid to purchase the Google Chrome browser, a figure significantly higher than its own valuation.

          <p>Over the past 50 years, overall cancer survival has doubled in the UK, but progress has been highly uneven, according to a new study. While survival rates for cancers like melanoma and breast cancer have seen dramatic improvements, those for pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, and lung cancer have barely changed, remaining below 20%. This has caused the survival gap between the best and worst-performing cancer outcomes to nearly double. Researchers attribute the disparity to challenges in early detection and a lack of effective treatment options for the deadliest forms of the disease.</p>

          <p>Residents in parts of Juneau, Alaska, are being urged to evacuate as a "glacial outburst" flood from the Mendenhall River threatens the area. The flooding occurs when an ice dam on the Mendenhall Glacier, weakened by summer heat linked to climate change, collapses and releases a massive volume of water from a glacial lake. Forecasters predict the river could surpass last year's record-breaking flood levels, which destroyed buildings and infrastructure. Authorities have installed emergency barriers but are advising evacuation as a precaution.</p>

          <h2>UK Police Given New Guidance to Release Suspects' Nationality and Ethnicity in High-Profile Cases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in sensitive and high-profile investigations. The change aims to combat misinformation and increase public trust through transparency, though the final decision to release such information will remain with individual forces. This follows several cases where a lack of information led to widespread speculation and, in one instance, was partly blamed for sparking riots. The Home Office has welcomed the move toward greater transparency.</p>

          <p>Approximately 100 protesters, mostly women, held a "Dance against Vance" event in the Cotswolds village of Charlbury to express their opposition to a visit by U.S. Vice President JD Vance.

The protest highlighted local frustration with the area becoming a retreat for powerful right-wing figures. The visit has caused significant disruption, with road closures and a heavy presence of police and U.S. Secret Service agents.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Transport Committee has recommended piloting a free bus pass scheme for everyone under 22 in England to improve access to work and education. The report highlights that declining bus services and fares rising faster than inflation have become a significant barrier to opportunity, particularly in rural areas. A similar program is already in place in Scotland. MPs argue that unreliable and expensive public transport restricts young people's prospects and contributes to social exclusion for various vulnerable groups.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, the engineering giant, has claimed the company has the potential to become the UK's most valuable by powering the energy-intensive AI industry. The firm has signed deals to provide small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to power data centers in the UK and the Czech Republic. While SMRs are still an unproven technology on land, the company is leveraging its extensive experience building nuclear reactors for submarines. The CEO's ambitious vision has contributed to a ten-fold increase in the company's share price since 2023.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's car industry is at a critical juncture, with vehicle production in the first half of 2025 falling to its lowest point since 1953. Recent factory closures by major brands like Vauxhall and Honda, combined with high energy costs and the lingering effects of Brexit, have contributed to the decline. Experts warn that the industry is losing its critical mass, which could have a devastating knock-on effect on the supply chain, skilled jobs, and regional economies. The sector's future may depend on attracting new investment for the transition to electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has struck a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of the revenue.

President Trump defended the deal, stating the chips in question are "obsolete," while Nvidia expressed hope that it will allow America to better compete in the global AI market.

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination has alarmed many economists, who view Antoni as a partisan figure unqualified to lead the traditionally nonpartisan agency. Concerns were amplified after Antoni suggested the BLS could stop issuing its monthly jobs report, a key economic indicator. The move follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner after a weak jobs report, raising fears of political pressure to manipulate economic data.</p>

Organizers called for an end to the raids, the release of detainees, and a boycott of major companies they claim are not adequately protecting their immigrant employees.

The primary goal is to discuss an end to the war, though the White House has framed it as a "listening exercise." Ukraine's president is not expected to attend in person.</p>
