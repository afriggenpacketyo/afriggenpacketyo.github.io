          <p>Nippon Steel has finalized its $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, which includes an agreement granting the US government veto power over key corporate decisions. The deal, initially blocked by President Biden due to national security concerns, was restructured with the Trump administration's involvement to allow greater US government control. The agreement includes the authority for the US President to name a board member and a "golden share" that gives the US government veto authority over corporate decisions that could affect US jobs. This acquisition gives Nippon Steel further access into the growing U.S. market for high-grade steel. </p>

          <p>The opening of the HS2 high-speed rail line in the UK will be delayed beyond 2033, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, who cited mismanagement and ballooning costs. Alexander described the project as an "appalling mess," with costs rising by Â£37bn since its approval in 2012. Two reports highlighted ineffective contracts and bad management as key issues, leading to the appointment of Mike Brown as the new chair of HS2. The project, originally intended to connect London with major cities in the Midlands and North of England, has faced numerous setbacks and scope reductions over the years. The government intends to provide an update on costs and deadlines before the end of the year.</p>

          <p>A person from Yorkshire, UK, has died from rabies after being bitten by a stray dog while on holiday in Morocco. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has stated that there is no risk to the wider public, as rabies is not known to pass between humans. Close contacts and health workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precaution. The UKHSA emphasizes that rabies is almost always fatal if left untreated, but post-exposure treatment is highly effective if administered promptly. Travelers to countries where rabies is present are advised to wash any wounds from animal bites or scratches thoroughly with soap and water and seek immediate medical attention.</p>

          <p>An Iranian official has cautioned that any U.S. involvement in the ongoing conflict with Israel could escalate the situation into an "all-out war." The conflict, now in its sixth day, involves exchanges of missiles and strikes on nuclear facilities. Israel has conducted extensive operations, including strikes on centrifuge production sites, while Iran has retaliated with missile launches targeting Israeli cities. President Trump has issued warnings to Iran, demanding an "unconditional surrender," while Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei has deemed the ultimatum unacceptable. The U.S. military is reportedly considering joining the strikes, though Israel has not requested direct military assistance.</p>

          <p>This article explores the life and career of Desi Arnaz, focusing on his pivotal role in revolutionizing the television industry. Arnaz, along with Lucille Ball, created "I Love Lucy," a show filmed on 35mm film, which enabled reruns and syndication, fundamentally changing television economics. The show was also created to save their marriage, as Lucy wanted Desi to be with her in California. Despite facing skepticism from CBS, Arnaz insisted on owning the rights to the show, a gamble that paid off immensely. Beyond his on-screen persona, Arnaz's innovations at Desilu Studios cemented his legacy as a visionary in television production.</p>

Despite the overall low levels, recent weeks have seen claims at the higher end of the range, indicating a potential deceleration in the U.S. job market.

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are expected to reach 30C (86F) in some areas, potentially leading to the first heatwave of 2025. The Met Office requires temperatures to reach a threshold for at least three consecutive days to declare a heatwave, and that threshold varies from 25C across the north and west of the UK, to 28C in parts of eastern England. The warm weather is attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot air from Western Europe. A recent Met Office study indicates a rapidly increasing risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK, driven by climate change.</p>

Pakistan shares a border with Iran's Balochistan province, where border crossings have been closed amid intensifying strikes. Analysts suggest that increased conflict could exacerbate separatist attacks in Balochistan and strain Pakistan's security apparatus. Additionally, disruptions to global oil supplies via the Strait of Hormuz could drive up energy prices, impacting Pakistan's already fragile economy. The potential for sectarian tensions is also a concern, given Pakistan's diverse religious makeup.</p>

The Iranian regime, weakened by internal pressures, views retaliation against Israeli strikes as crucial for its survival. Israel, driven by a need to reestablish regional military dominance and deter future threats, seeks U.S. military support to neutralize Iran's nuclear and ballistic capabilities. While Israel insists its mission is not about regime change, the conflict's outcome could significantly destabilize the theocratic rule in Iran. President Trump's contradictory statements on the situation add further uncertainty to the conflict's trajectory.</p>

          <p>Israel is set to ease some domestic restrictions imposed due to the ongoing conflict with Iran, allowing some workplaces to resume operations under the condition that they have shelters nearby.

The French government plans to introduce new guidelines allowing police to intervene more forcefully with small boats closer to the shoreline.
