          <p>UK companies are reportedly holding back on hiring new employees or replacing departing workers, resulting in a significant drop in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate slightly increased. The Office for National Statistics suggests that some firms may be delaying recruitment due to rising employment costs, including increased National Insurance Contributions and a minimum wage hike. Economists predict that the unemployment rate may continue to rise as businesses seek to offset employment costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union, was charged with interfering with law enforcement operations after being arrested during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles.

Huerta was released on $50,000 bond and is due back in court in July, while ICE has confirmed the arrest of 44 undocumented immigrants during worksite raids.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have surged in the first five months of the year, driven by consumer demand, offshore factory investments, and efforts to offset losses from high US tariffs. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have seen double-digit percentage increases compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly using Southeast Asian factories to produce finished goods for local and Western markets, including the US, in response to US import tariffs.

          <p>A think tank in Taiwan has initiated a two-day war game, inviting retired US and Japanese generals to simulate the island’s defense against a potential military attack from mainland China. The Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation organized the event to identify urgent defense issues and provide recommendations to the government. The exercise aims to assess the feasibility of Taiwan’s military strategy and operational concepts in response to Beijing’s potential use of force by 2030. This simulation underscores the ongoing tensions and strategic planning surrounding Taiwan's security.</p>

The agency urges caution in responding to low fertility, warning against panicky policies and manipulative responses aimed at increasing birth rates.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a massive reduction, particularly among Gen Z, with ages 20 to 29 experiencing a 47% decrease in fatal overdoses. The latest available records show that fentanyl and other drugs killed more than 31,000 people under the age of 35 in 2021, but by last year, that number had plummeted to roughly 16,690 fatal overdoses. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as the wider distribution of Narcan, a trend of weaker fentanyl being sold, more readily available addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to funding for science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis, however, pose a threat to this progress.</p>
