          <p>A panga boat washed ashore near San Diego, resulting in the discovery of three deceased individuals and four survivors requiring medical attention. The U.S. Coast Guard and Encinitas Fire Department are actively searching for nine individuals who remain unaccounted for following the incident, which occurred in Del Mar, approximately 20 miles north of San Diego. Local agencies are assisting in the search efforts, with air and water resources deployed to sweep the area, according to Encinitas Deputy Fire Chief Jorge Sanchez, who described the event as a 'mass casualty incident.'

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted student loans after a nearly five-year pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This restart coincides with a TransUnion analysis revealing record-high delinquency rates among student loan borrowers, with approximately 20% at risk of default. Borrowers in default could face wage garnishment, Social Security benefit withholding, and significant credit score damage, impacting their ability to secure future loans.

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced in foreign countries, citing concerns over the American movie industry's decline. This proposal has raised questions about its potential impact on both domestic and international film production, including American studios filming abroad and co-productions. Industry leaders and government officials are expressing uncertainty regarding the scope and implementation of the tariffs, with concerns about potential job losses and the competitiveness of the UK film sector.

          <p>As student loan collections resume, many borrowers are expressing confusion and struggling to navigate the repayment process, with some reporting a lack of communication from loan servicers. Jana Heartwood, a nurse with over $40,000 in student debt, stated she was not notified about her loans being delinquent and is currently unable to afford payments due to her son's medical condition. Experts like Persis Yu point to staff cuts at the Education Department as contributing to the disarray in the loan system, making it difficult for borrowers to obtain necessary information and assistance. The Department of Education attributes the current financial state of the student loan portfolio to attempts to transfer student debt to taxpayers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to offer undocumented immigrants $1,000 and travel assistance if they voluntarily return to their home countries. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that self-deportation is the safest, most cost-effective way for immigrants to avoid arrest, also noting that it is a 70% savings for US taxpayers. The administration promotes this initiative as a dignified departure option that may preserve the possibility of legal re-entry into the United States in the future. This measure is part of President Trump's broader effort to prioritize mass deportations, although the actual number of deportations has slightly lagged behind the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow money in the current high-interest rate environment may find a home equity line of credit (HELOC) an appealing option. Lenders typically evaluate HELOC applications based on sufficient home equity, a strong credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio, and stable income and employment. Prospective borrowers can improve their chances of approval by checking their credit report, lowering their DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and considering a co-applicant. Despite the challenges, many homeowners with substantial equity may still qualify for a HELOC, offering a flexible borrowing tool.</p>

Israeli officials said the offensive would start slowly pending cease-fire negotiations, but if no deal is reached, the ground operation would commence.

          <p>Ireland captain Caelan Doris's participation in the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia is uncertain due to a shoulder injury that requires a 'procedure.' The 27-year-old sustained the injury during Leinster's Champions Cup semi-final loss, and the full extent of the injury and its implications for the summer will not be known until after the procedure. Leinster senior coach Jacques Nienaber expressed concern, fearing the injury is 'quite serious,' potentially impacting Doris's availability for the Lions tour.</p>

          <p>Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has announced his resignation after his coalition government's presidential candidate was eliminated in the first round of elections.

With the Social Democrats' departure, forming a governing majority would require support from the far-right in the legislature.

          <p>Trade negotiations between the UK and US will address film tariffs after Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 100% charge on movies made in foreign countries. The UK government stated it is taking a 'calm and steady approach' to talks to ease pressure on UK businesses. UK filmmakers warned that freelancers risked being 'jobless' if US productions were pulled, while one union said the tariffs could deal a 'knock-out blow'. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs is concerning for many, with questions about whether they will affect only British films exported to the US or also co-productions.</p>
