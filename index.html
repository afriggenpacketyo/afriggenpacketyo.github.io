          <h2>Trump Defends Accepting Qatari Luxury Jet for Air Force One</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 22:20:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump defended his administration's plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, citing the U.S.'s support for Qatar's security. The potential gift has raised legal and ethical concerns due to the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Critics from both the left and right have questioned the deal, while the White House maintains that any gift would be accepted in compliance with applicable laws. The Qatari jet is reported to be worth around $400 million and would require retrofitting and security clearance before use, as Boeing has been contracted to provide the White House with two 747-8s directly, but Trump has complained that the firm was behind schedule.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom released a model ordinance for cities to address homeless encampments, accompanied by new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom emphasized that cities must take action and utilize available resources to provide alternatives to encampments. The model ordinance includes principles that prioritize shelter and services while allowing local authorities to clear encampments. This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his term amidst speculation about his political future, and as many California cities have already been implementing stiffer policies against homeless encampments since the Supreme Court ruling in favor of anti-camping ordinances.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born student, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Local police admitted to stopping the wrong vehicle, expressing regret for the mistake. Arias Cristobal, who has lived in the U.S. since age 4, faces deportation despite lacking a criminal record. Her lawyers stated she would likely remain in ICE custody, pending a bond hearing, because federal officials are holding her because she's in the U.S. without legal permission, as the Trump administration has expanded ICE's authority to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>An auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie’s in New York revealed a cautious art market, with many items presold and quiet bidding. Experts attributed the subdued atmosphere to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariffs. The auction house had guaranteed an undisclosed minimum amount for the collection, but the sale fell short of pre-sale expectations. While some paintings by artists like Gerhard Richter and Claude Monet performed well, a Warhol painting was withdrawn, signaling weakness in that market, and some successful transactions demonstrated how far the market had fallen for certain artworks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, a program that allows migrants to get work permits and temporary reprieve from deportation if the U.S. government determines it is unsafe for them to return to their home countries due to war, natural disaster or some other issues. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan's security situation has improved and its economy is stabilizing, allowing for the winddown of TPS. Over 8,000 Afghans were approved for TPS as of last year. This decision has drawn criticism from advocates who argue it will have long-lasting negative effects, as the Trump administration has also sought to roll back TPS for Venezuela, but a judge halted that move in March.</p>

          <p>Sussan Ley has been named the first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton after the party's historic election loss. Ley, a moderate, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, particularly women and younger voters who feel neglected. Her appointment follows a landslide election win for the Labor Party, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sworn in and announcing his new cabinet. The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected David Littleproud as leader. Ley previously served as the party deputy under Dutton and has held the massive regional New South Wales seat of Farrer since 2001 and has served as a senior minister in a variety of portfolios - making her one of the Liberal Party's most experienced hands.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed significant restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), seeking to limit funding and benefits as part of a broader package to advance President Trump's tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding to SNAP and impose stricter work requirements on beneficiaries, potentially causing millions of low-income families to lose access to the program. Republicans argue this approach will improve SNAP and control costs, while Democrats and anti-poverty groups warn it would deepen hunger and increase poverty. The proposals are likely to anger congressional Democrats and anti-poverty groups, many of whom have pushed for more generous federal nutrition aid.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged over the past year, driven by factors like unpredictable US trade policy and geopolitical uncertainty. While seen as a safe haven asset, gold is not immune to price fluctuations, and past surges have been followed by significant falls. Central banks have been buying gold to add to their official reserves, and fears of weaponization of the dollar system have also contributed to demand. Some experts believe the upward trend will continue, while others warn of a potential market bubble, and it is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>The use of GLP-1 drugs should be focused on improving health, not just weight loss, according to this article. While effective for weight loss, GLP-1s are expensive and have side effects, so they should be used for individuals with excess visceral fat and related health consequences. The drugs are remarkably effective at reducing visceral fat, a type of fat linked to cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. Physicians should rely on metrics like waist size and blood-lipid patterns, not just BMI, to determine appropriate candidates for GLP-1 treatment.</p>

          <p>The United States and China said Monday they have agreed to slash most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the so-called reciprocal duties for 90 days, in a surprise move that appears to be an about-face from their bitter trade war, prompting a surge in stock prices. The agreement reached during high-level trade talks in Geneva over the weekend means that the United States will cut its recent tariffs on China, imposed since Donald Trump's second presidency started in January, to 30 percent from 145 percent. China, meanwhile, will lower its retaliatory tariffs on the United States to 10 percent from 125 percent.</p>
