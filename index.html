          <p>President Trump has appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine following a deadly attack on Kyiv. Trump's remarks come as he has made renewed efforts to end the conflict, reportedly on terms favorable to Russia. Closer to home, Trump's attempts to change voting requirements, which advocates say would disenfranchise millions, have been blocked by a federal judge.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization is selling merchandise with the message "Trump 2028," raising questions about President Trump's potential interest in seeking a third term, which is barred by the Constitution. The 22nd Amendment limits presidents to two terms. Trump has previously teased the idea of running for a third term, suggesting that there are methods to make it possible. The White House referred inquiries about the merchandise to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
