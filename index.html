          <h2>PBS Sues Trump Administration Over Funding Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 16:55:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to prevent his administration from cutting off federal funding for the public broadcaster. The lawsuit asserts that Trump's efforts violate the U.S. Constitution and existing telecommunications law, which protects public television's editorial independence. PBS argues that Trump's executive order, which directs agencies to cease funding NPR and PBS, is an attempt to control the content of their programming, constituting viewpoint discrimination and retaliation for perceived political slights in news coverage. The nonprofit media outlet seeks to invalidate the executive order and safeguard the autonomy of its member stations, arguing that the president is legally barred from meddling with the broadcaster's funding or content. This legal action follows a similar suit filed by NPR against the Trump administration earlier in the week, both challenging the president's authority over public broadcasting funding and content. Optimism for the situation rests on the fact that legal precedent exists to protect PBS from such actions.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans, led by Senators Eric Schmitt and John Cornyn, are planning a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to investigate Joe Biden's cognitive abilities during his presidency. The senators claim the media covered up Biden's alleged cognitive decline and seek to determine who was effectively running the country. The investigation will also scrutinize Biden's use of autopen. Republicans have been calling for probes into Biden's health, with some suggesting that former First Lady Jill Biden should testify about her knowledge of his condition. The upcoming hearing follows the release of a book making claims about the Bidens' capacity for denial and lack of transparency about health issues. The investigation's goal is to ensure transparency for future presidents, however top Democrats have largely avoided defending Biden as new details surrounding the former president's health and alleged cover-up have emerged in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has passed away at the age of 87 in her New York City home, reportedly from natural causes. Swit starred in stage and screen productions, but she gained widespread recognition for her role as a foil to Alan Alda's Capt. Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce on "M*A*S*H," which aired for 11 seasons on CBS. She won two Emmys and was nominated for four Golden Globes for her performances on the show. Swit aimed to portray Houlihan as a complex character beyond the "Hot Lips" nickname, focusing on her development and experiences throughout the series. Her passing marks the loss of a beloved actress who significantly contributed to television history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, following his indication that he had approved a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keenly awaiting details on the structure of the deal, which Trump described as a "partnership." Senator Dave McCormick stated that the U.S. government will retain a "golden share" allowing it to influence board appointments and ensure production levels are maintained. The deal, initially blocked by President Joe Biden over national security concerns, underwent a new review ordered by Trump, leading to the current "partnership" announcement. While specifics remain scarce, the agreement is expected to involve Nippon investing $14 billion over 14 months, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel are awaiting a response from Hamas to a 60-day ceasefire proposal for Gaza, according to the White House. Israel has approved the proposal, submitted by special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump, which includes the release of hostages by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The agreement outlines a cessation of Israeli offensive military activities in Gaza and the start of negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Humanitarian aid will be immediately sent into Gaza upon Hamas's acceptance of the deal. However, Hamas has expressed reservations, stating that the proposal does not meet their demands for an end to the war and famine. Despite this, a senior Hamas figure indicated they are studying the proposal, seeking guarantees that Israel will not attack Gaza during the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst defended proposed Medicaid cuts at a town hall meeting in Iowa, responding to constituents' concerns that the cuts could lead to people dying with the statement, "Well, we all are going to die." Ernst clarified that the focus would be on removing ineligible individuals from Medicaid, protecting those who meet eligibility requirements. The proposed cuts are part of a larger spending package being considered in Congress, aiming to create savings by targeting "waste, fraud, and abuse" in the system. However, constituents expressed concerns that many Medicaid recipients work but do not earn a living wage, making them deserving of the benefits. Ernst emphasized that children will continue to receive necessary coverage, while also defending the work of the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has signed a law restricting cellphone use in public schools across the state. The law limits cellphone use for all Virginia public elementary, middle, and high school students during the school day. This measure builds upon Youngkin's previous executive order aimed at creating cellphone-free education policies, with the goal of reducing distractions and disruptions in classrooms. The law includes exceptions for students with individualized education plans, health conditions, or Section 504 plans, allowing cellphone use when medically necessary. Research suggests that cellphone use in classrooms can negatively impact students' grades, social skills, and mental health, prompting this legislative action to restore focus and academic excellence.</p>

However, an analysis suggests that DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and other factors. Musk announced he would be finishing his time at the White House and thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending, despite public splits from Mr. Trump over his sweeping domestic policy package, which the president calls his "big beautiful bill."</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Elon Musk is "not really leaving" the administration, despite Musk's departure from his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump said Musk will continue to be "back and forth" to the White House, emphasizing that DOGE is Musk's "baby." Musk's departure comes after 130 days in office, the maximum allowable for his status as a "special government employee". Musk insisted that DOGE will continue to "relentlessly" seek $1 trillion in reductions. The meeting between the two men comes just days after an interview with CBS in which Musk said he was "disappointed" in what Trump has referred to as his "big, beautiful" bill.</p>

          <p>Business owners are expressing concerns about the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, even after a U.S. trade court ruled them "unlawful." While the administration appeals the ruling, the tariffs remain in place, leaving businesses guessing about import costs. The shifting trade landscape creates headaches beyond the direct costs of the tariffs, with businesses working through thousands of price changes to reflect fluctuating import costs. Some businesses may be eligible for refunds on tariffs already paid if the ruling is ultimately upheld, but the process could take months. The situation highlights the challenges faced by businesses in navigating a volatile trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Mondelez is seeking monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling products that infringe on its trademarks. Aldi products, such as Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies and Thin Wheat, are cited as examples of look-alikes with similar packaging design elements to Mondelez products.

          <p>PBS and a public television station in rural Minnesota have filed a lawsuit against President Trump over his executive order demanding that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) eliminate funding for the network. The suit alleges that Trump's order exceeds his authority and violates Constitutional protections of free speech, as he has expressed dislike for PBS's news coverage and programming. The lawsuit states that the executive order is cutting off funds to PBS due to its content, constituting viewpoint discrimination. The White House maintains that CPB is creating media to support a particular political party using taxpayer money.

          <p>The recent kidnapping and torture case in New York City involving an Italian tourist allegedly targeted for his cryptocurrency holdings has drawn attention to a growing trend of "wrench attacks." These attacks combine cybertheft with physical violence, as criminals target crypto owners to obtain their account passwords. The rise in these attacks is attributed to the increasing value of bitcoin and the relative ease of stealing digital wallets compared to traditional bank accounts. The crypto world's culture of flaunting wealth also makes it easier for criminals to identify potential targets. Authorities recommend crypto investors maintain a lower profile and implement multi-signature access to their wallets to mitigate the risk of such attacks.</p>

          <p>As U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger retires, he expresses concern about the significant increase in threats against members of Congress. The number of threats has more than quadrupled in recent years, requiring the department to expand its protection efforts nationwide. Manger notes that the Capitol Police has nationwide jurisdiction to address these threats, sending investigators across the country. He has secured large budget increases to bolster security and investigations, but the growing need to protect lawmakers in their home states requires more funding and staff. Manger emphasizes the importance of ensuring the safety of lawmakers as they travel and meet with constituents.</p>
