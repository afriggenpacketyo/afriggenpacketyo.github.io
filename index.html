          <p>The Jolly Roger flag from the popular Japanese manga "One Piece" has been adopted by Gen Z protesters in countries like Nepal and Indonesia as a symbol of resistance against corruption and autocratic governments. The flag, representing the series' protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and his crew's fight for freedom, resonates with youth-led movements challenging authority. This phenomenon follows a trend of pop culture symbols, such as the Guy Fawkes mask, being used in real-world political demonstrations to unite activists and communicate ideals. The article explores how this fictional emblem has gone viral, empowering young people globally.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing significant political instability following the resignation of its fifth prime minister in under two years, Sébastien Lecornu, after just 27 days. This chaos complicates the nation's ability to address its severe fiscal issues, including a budget deficit of 5.8% and a debt pile at 113% of GDP, both far exceeding EU limits. President Macron has given Lecornu a 48-hour deadline to find a path forward, but the fragmented parliament makes fiscal consolidation seem unlikely. The situation has prompted concerns in Brussels and among investors about France's financial discipline.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of consumers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal. The scheme, covering 14 million agreements from 2007 to 2024, is expected to result in average payouts of around £700 per claim, with a total lender liability of £8.2 billion. The issue stems from undisclosed commission arrangements and unfair contracts that led to customers overpaying for loans. While the FCA aims to provide fair redress, the lending industry has contested the scale of the proposed compensation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prosecution of two men accused of spying for China has been dropped, a decision the UK's Director of Public Prosecutions attributed to the government's failure to officially label China a national security threat. This designation was a necessary legal threshold following a precedent set in a separate espionage case involving Russian agents. Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements from the government that met this new evidential standard.

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has commented that some US fans at the recent Ryder Cup in New York "probably crossed the line" with their behavior towards the European team. The event, which Europe won, was marked by verbal abuse from the home crowd, particularly directed at Rory McIlroy, whose wife was also hit by a thrown cup. Morikawa, who had previously called for "absolute chaos" from the fans, clarified that he did not intend for them to be rude. The incidents highlight ongoing debates about fan conduct and sportsmanship at the highly charged tournament.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old boy has died after being attacked by two Rottweiler dogs at an unlicensed daycare center in Valdosta, Georgia. According to police, the daycare owner, Stacy Wheeler Cobb, left the child unattended for over two hours while she napped, during which time he apparently entered the backyard and opened the dogs' kennel. Cobb has since been charged with second-degree murder and cruelty to children. The tragic incident has devastated the child's family and led to an ongoing police investigation that may result in further charges.</p>

          <p>The price of spot gold has reached a historic high, surging past $4,000 an ounce for the first time as investors seek safe-haven assets. This rally is fueled by global economic and political instability, including the ongoing US government shutdown and political turmoil in France. A weakening US dollar and increased purchasing by retail investors and central banks, notably an 11-month buying streak by China's central bank, are also significant contributing factors. Analysts note this is gold's largest rally since the 1970s, reflecting deep-seated market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

The initial plan nearly failed, forcing Sasaki into the game anyway, and Roberts has since confirmed Sasaki is the primary closing option moving forward.

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, author of the bestselling book "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," has revealed that his follow-up book was significantly delayed after his iPad was stolen. The device contained numerous drawings and writings for the new book, "Always Remember," which had not been backed up, forcing him to recreate much of the work from memory. The theft, which happened when he left his car unlocked, was a major setback during a period that also included the loss of his mother and dog. The experience made him question if the project was worthwhile but ultimately did not stop him.</p>

          <p>Residents of an apartment building in Portland, Oregon, located opposite a federal ICE facility, describe nightly clashes between protesters and federal agents as living in a "war zone." For months, the area has been the site of unrest, with tear gas seeping into apartments and confrontations occurring in hallways. The situation has put the city in a national spotlight, with President Trump threatening to deploy the National Guard, a move temporarily blocked by a federal judge. While some residents blame Antifa for the violence, others accuse federal agents of inflaming the situation.</p>

Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, both have national security backgrounds. This spending highlights the intensity of these off-year elections, which are often viewed as a referendum on the current presidential administration.</p>

          <p>A supermoon, known as the Hunter's Moon, has appeared in the night sky, offering a brighter and larger-than-usual lunar spectacle for observers globally. A supermoon occurs when the full moon coincides with its perigee, the point in its orbit where it is closest to Earth. This particular event gets its name from being the first full moon of October, a time historically associated with hunting in preparation for winter. The event provided stunning photographic opportunities of the illuminated moon over various world landmarks.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps has won a crowded Republican primary for a vacant U.S. House seat in Tennessee, a victory that came after a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump.

The race is for the seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, a safely Republican area, vacated by former Rep. Mark Green. The outcome of the December election could offer insights into the continuing influence of Trump's agenda on Republican-leaning suburban voters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Herschel Walker, the former football star and 2022 Georgia Senate candidate, to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas.

His confirmation was part of a large package of over 100 nominees approved in a single vote by Senate Republicans, utilizing a recent rule change to expedite the process.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is appealing a federal judge's order that restricts the Los Angeles Police Department from using crowd control weapons, like 40mm projectile launchers, against journalists and nonviolent protesters. The injunction was granted after the LAPD faced numerous allegations of excessive force during recent protests. City attorneys argue the ban is impractical and puts officers at risk by causing hesitation in chaotic situations, while civil rights lawyers counter that police have deliberately targeted individuals in violation of their own guidelines. The case will now proceed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
