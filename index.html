          <p>An art exhibit in Los Angeles is displaying 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of Robert E. Lee, to reframe their historical narrative. The "Monuments" exhibition aims to confront the "Lost Cause" ideology and the figures' association with white supremacy, contrasting them with contemporary art pieces. Curators and activists involved see the project as a way to purify a toxic representation of history and spark dialogue about what and whom society chooses to memorialize.</p>

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the U.S. agency responsible for the country's nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees due to the prolonged government shutdown. This marks the first time the agency has had to lay off workers since its inception in 2000, leaving fewer than 400 employees on duty. While officials assure the stockpile's security, the furloughs are expected to hinder efforts to modernize aging nuclear weapons, highlighting the shutdown's impact on national security operations.</p>

          <p>Texas Representative Chip Roy, a Republican, strongly criticized the Democratic Party during a press conference concerning the ongoing government shutdown. He asserted that Democrats chose not to fund the government in order to support political rallies against former President Trump, describing the party as taking its "dying breaths." Roy, alongside other GOP leaders, urged Senate Democrats to pass the House-approved funding bill to reopen the government and end the protracted political stalemate affecting federal services.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated he is open to participating in a proposed summit with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, following reports of a tense meeting at the White House. The meeting allegedly involved the U.S. side urging Ukraine to accept Russian terms, including surrendering the Donbas region, to end the war. Zelensky emphasized his goal is a "just peace, not a quick peace," and expressed skepticism about Hungary as a neutral location for talks due to its pro-Kremlin stance.</p>

          <p>The article outlines the significant financial consequences of abandoning a debt settlement program before completion. Dropping out leaves unsettled debts fully owed, with interest and late fees continuing to accrue, potentially making balances larger than when the program started. Additionally, any funds deposited may be reduced by fees, credit scores will likely remain damaged, and aggressive collection activities, including lawsuits, can resume from creditors, undoing any progress made.

          <p>A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's leading cloud infrastructure provider, caused widespread disruptions for numerous prominent websites and online services on Monday. The issue originated from a DNS problem within AWS's US-East-1 region in Virginia, affecting companies like Disney+, Reddit, and even Amazon's own internal warehouse and delivery systems. While AWS reported signs of recovery, the event highlighted the internet's heavy dependence on a small number of major cloud providers for its daily operations.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece contends that while politicians often downplay Chicago's crime rates for political reasons, the city's violence remains a severe and unresolved issue. The article highlights the recent killing of police officer Aréanah Preston to illustrate the pervasive threat, especially in the city's Black and Latino neighborhoods. The author argues that despite a recent drop from peak homicide levels, Chicago's murder rate is still far higher than that of New York or Los Angeles, attributing the problem to decades of disinvestment and political indifference.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the U.S., appears to be holding despite significant clashes over the weekend that threatened to derail the peace plan. U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reinforce the agreement, which saw Israel launch heavy airstrikes on Gaza after two of its soldiers were killed. Both sides accused each other of violations but have since recommitted to the process, allowing humanitarian aid to resume through the Kerem Shalom crossing.</p>

          <p>A career expert and executive coach provides five strategies for effectively working with a controlling manager without becoming exhausted or frustrated. The advice includes submitting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and over-communicating on tasks and schedules to satisfy their need for oversight. Other tactics involve preemptively asking for their thoughts to get ahead of criticism and directly asking for positive feedback to balance their focus on adjustments.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose their value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this rapid depreciation include the historically higher government and manufacturer incentives on new EVs, which lower their resale value from the start. Additionally, the fast pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, can make older models seem quickly outdated to value-conscious used car buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's income to their state's median; those earning below the median typically qualify easily. Higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income, and factors like recent luxury purchases or attempts to hide assets can also lead to denial.
