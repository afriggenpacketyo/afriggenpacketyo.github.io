        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have decreased for the fifth consecutive month, with a nearly 28% drop in May compared to the previous year. This decline is attributed to European customers increasingly choosing cheaper Chinese electric vehicles like those from BYD. Tesla's market share in Europe also fell from 1.8% to 1.2% during the same period, contributing to a year-to-date stock decrease of over 18%. While Tesla faces rising competition from traditional automakers, the company is also grappling with the negative impact of CEO Elon Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities on its brand image in Europe. Optimism in the company's revamped Model Y SUV is tempered by broader market trends. </p>

          <p>Marcus Monzo has been found guilty of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin with a samurai sword in Hainault last year, and also guilty of attempted murder, wounding with intent, and possession of an offensive weapon. Monzo attacked a pedestrian, two police officers, and a couple in their home before being arrested, and had a blue belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu. The former Amazon delivery driver screamed and smiled after fatally wounding Daniel, who was walking to school. Monzo had gone into a cannabis-induced psychosis before the attack, and had killed and skinned his pet cat before heading to Hainault, and was cleared of one count of attempted murder but found guilty of the lesser offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The attacks took place within just 20 minutes in the morning on 30 April 2024. </p>

Starmer insists the Labour party is united on reforming the welfare system, dismissing criticism as minor distractions.

He stated that this agreement would add over $1 trillion annually toward common defense. Trump emphasized that this commitment is a significant win for the United States and Europe, as it addresses the disproportionate share of defense burden previously carried by the U.S.</p>

          <p>The "Russian House" in Berlin, a cultural center run by the Russian federal agency Rossotrudnichestvo, is under scrutiny for allegedly spreading pro-Putin propaganda. Critics point to events at the center, including film screenings portraying Ukrainians as Nazis, and the sale of tank-shaped soap for children. Despite the agency being on the EU sanctions list, the German government, as the property owner, pays €70,000 in property taxes annually due to a bilateral agreement. While some call for its closure, the German government fears Russia might retaliate by closing the Goethe Institute in Moscow. </p>

          <p>After decades of rhetoric and recent strikes on Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming a "historic victory" following a ceasefire agreement. For years, Netanyahu sought to attack Iran, but was deterred by the United States and his own security chiefs. However, after 12 days of strikes on Iran, he is now taking credit for a shift in the Middle East. While painting Iran as Israel's arch-enemy helped Netanyahu distract from the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians, the war on Iran also helped Netanyahu with political problems at home. </p>
