          <p>The European Union has condemned President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, citing concerns about global economic uncertainty. An EU spokesperson stated the move undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war and warned of potential countermeasures. The United Steelworkers union also criticized the tariff increase, highlighting the risk to Canadian industries and workers. The EU had previously paused its countermeasures against the U.S. to allow for negotiations, but it is now prepared to reinstate those measures if a mutually acceptable solution is not reached.

          <p>Hamas has responded to a U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, seeking amendments to ensure a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid. The militant group stated it would release 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, the U.N. Food Program reported that 77 trucks carrying aid were stopped by hungry Palestinians who took the food, highlighting the dire humanitarian situation. The U.N. has described Gaza as the "hungriest place on Earth," with a nearly three-month Israeli blockade pushing the population to the brink of famine. The ongoing conflict continues to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis, with reports of casualties from Israeli strikes and the urgent need for increased aid deliveries. </p>

          <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama is facing backlash for stating that creating life is "the least" of what a woman's reproductive system does. During a podcast episode, Obama lamented that women's reproductive health "has been reduced to the question of choice," arguing that there is much more at stake. She also criticized Republican men for choosing to "trade out women's health for a tax break" and suggested that some Republican women voted for President Trump because of their husbands. Pro-life activists have criticized Obama's remarks, with some asserting that motherhood is a beautiful and powerful gift. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the role and value of women's reproductive health in society.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right AfD party is portrayed as a defender of Christian values against Islam, but the connection is more strategic than deeply religious. While the AfD leverages Christian traditions to appeal to a broader audience, it doesn't maintain close ties with major churches. The party exploits fears about immigration and societal change, using Christian rhetoric to attack Islam and promote a sense of cultural identity. Critics view this relationship as instrumental, noting that the AfD draws on Christian traditions only when it suits its political agenda.</p>

The U.S. State Department has been revoking visas of musicians playing "narco-corridos," a genre that sometimes glorifies cartel leaders. Grupo Firme had recently distanced itself from this aspect of the genre, but the suspension highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding cartel-related music. The situation also underscores the dangers faced by Mexican musicians, who have been targeted by criminal groups and caught in cartel turf wars.</p>

          <p>Jessica Pegula expressed her frustration with the lack of women's night matches at the French Open, highlighting the ongoing issue of gender inequality in sports scheduling. She pointed out that none of the night sessions during the first eight days of the tournament featured a women's singles match. This has led to accusations that the scheduling implies female players are not as valued, a sentiment strongly refuted by the tournament director. Pegula emphasized the need for equal opportunities and consistent efforts to address this imbalance.</p>

          <p>Phillip Inman argues that Ukraine needs access to the €300bn of frozen Russian assets to bolster its fight against Russia. He suggests that confiscating these funds, mostly central bank funds, would shock Putin, undermine support for the war, and provide a psychological boost to Ukraine. While Euroclear and some governments express concerns about undermining Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, Inman contends that the situation with Russia is an extreme case and should not deter the EU from seizing the assets. He emphasizes that Ukraine needs the money now to demonstrate unity and force, particularly given Putin's potential to invade other parts of Europe.</p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, has warned that Iran has significantly increased its production of highly enriched uranium, possessing over 400kg enriched to 60% purity. This level is well above civilian use and close to weapons grade, raising serious concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions. The IAEA cannot confirm whether Iran's program remains peaceful, and the increased production rate is equivalent to roughly one nuclear weapon per month. Israel has accused Iran of being determined to acquire nuclear weapons, while Iran maintains its program is peaceful, though US officials estimate Iran could produce weapons-grade material in less than two weeks if it chose to.</p>
