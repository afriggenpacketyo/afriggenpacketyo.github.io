          <p>Trevor McEuen, a Texas capital murder suspect who had been out on bond, was apprehended after evading authorities for several weeks. McEuen allegedly cut off his ankle monitor and fled on the day his trial was scheduled to begin in connection with the 2023 shooting of his neighbor. Governor Greg Abbott has cited this case to advocate for bail reform, pushing for a state constitutional amendment that would require judges to automatically deny bail for violent crimes. McEuen faces charges including capital murder by terror threat, murder, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

          <p>A second round of direct discussions between Ukraine and Russia took place in Istanbul, but resulted in minimal progress toward resolving the conflict. While an agreement was reached to exchange prisoners, the talks failed to produce significant steps toward ending the fighting.

The budget imposes a tax of 25 cents per wager on the first 20 million online sports bets each fiscal year, rising to 50 cents thereafter. Analysts predict that DraftKings and Flutter's FanDuel will face the higher tax rate on a portion of their bets, while smaller competitors will experience a more modest impact.

          <p>German antitrust regulators have cautioned Amazon that its pricing mechanisms for third-party sellers could violate competition laws. The Federal Cartel Office's preliminary assessment suggests that Amazon's pricing controls, which use algorithms to set price caps, limit merchants' product visibility and interfere with their pricing freedom. Amazon's practices could harm sellers' businesses and deter other retailers from offering lower prices. The Cartel Office's president, Andreas Mundt, emphasized that influencing competitors' pricing is questionable from a competition perspective, as Amazon competes directly with other marketplace retailers on its platform.</p>
