          <p>The Department of Education has warned Columbia University's accreditor about alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The department claims Columbia failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism and did not properly address complaints from Jewish students. The university's accreditor is now required to develop a compliance plan or face consequences. This action is part of the administration's broader effort to address harassment of Jewish students on college campuses amid the Israel-Hamas war. The optimism score is based on the fact that the school has the opportunity to make reparations.</p>

          <p>A Biden-appointed federal judge in Colorado issued a temporary restraining order halting the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is under investigation for the Boulder firebombing attack. The judge, Gordon P. Gallagher, cited the potential for "irreparable harm" if the family were deported before their case could be heard. The family's visas have reportedly been overstayed, but an asylum application had been submitted on their behalf. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the family's potential knowledge or support of the attack is being investigated. The optimism score reflects the family's opportunity to present their case, but also the severity of the alleged crime.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian military airfields, which Putin indicated would require a response. The call occurred amid ongoing tensions and stalled U.S.-brokered peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. Putin reportedly stated strongly that he would need to react to the airfield attacks, leading to concerns about potential escalation. Both leaders affirmed their readiness to maintain constant contact following what they described as a positive and productive exchange.

          <p>The government in England announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 children from September 2026. Any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible, regardless of their income, a change from the current requirement of earning less than Â£7,400 a year. The Department for Education has allocated Â£1 billion to fund this initiative up to 2029, which is expected to save parents Â£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. While welcomed by education and anti-poverty organizations, some argue that other measures, like lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective. The optimism score is based on the positive impact on child poverty and family finances.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that a Republican policy bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt. This nonpartisan estimate is likely to intensify the debate within the Republican Party regarding the fiscal implications of enacting President Trump's agenda.

          <p>The California Supreme Court heard arguments regarding whether the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) violated state law when it reduced financial incentives for residential rooftop solar panels in 2022. Environmental groups argue that the CPUC did not consider all the benefits of solar panels and failed to ensure expansion in disadvantaged communities. Lawyers representing the Attorney General's office sided with the CPUC and utilities, arguing that the credits were causing a "cost shift" to non-solar customers. The justices will issue a decision within 90 days, potentially impacting the future of rooftop solar in California.

          <p>The European Union is pressing China to lift export controls on rare earth minerals and magnets, citing an "alarming situation" for European industries. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic raised the issue during a meeting with Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, highlighting the essential role of rare earths in manufacturing high-tech goods. China introduced export controls on several rare earth elements in April, leading to concerns about supply shortages and production disruptions in Europe. The optimism score reflects the potential for a resolution through diplomatic channels and the diversification of rare earth sources.</p>
