        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in fixed income trading and investment banking. Despite the positive results, the bank's net earnings saw a 17% decrease compared to the same period last year, which had been inflated by a significant gain on Visa shares. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also pointed to significant risks from trade uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. The report sets the stage for other major banks to release their quarterly results.</p>

          <p>Manchester City has extended its partnership with kit manufacturer Puma in a deal reportedly worth a minimum of £1 billion over ten years, making it the largest in Premier League history. The new contract, valued at £100 million annually until at least 2035, surpasses Manchester United's £90 million-a-year deal with Adidas. The extension follows a period of significant on-field success and global sales growth for the club since the initial partnership began in 2019. This deal further solidifies the club's financial strength, following a year where it announced record revenues.</p>

          <p>The BBC's latest annual report has once again named Gary Lineker as its highest-paid presenter, a position he has held for eight years, with earnings around £1.35 million. Former Radio 2 host Zoe Ball ranked second, though her salary decreased significantly after changing roles. The report was released amid confirmations of staff dismissals following a review of the corporation's culture and workplace conduct. It also noted a slight decline in license fee-paying households but an increase in perceived impartiality of its news coverage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is set to vote on a White House request to rescind $9.4 billion in previously approved funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The package, already passed by the House, seeks to cut $8.3 billion from USAID and other international programs, and $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. Some Senate Republicans have expressed resistance to certain cuts, such as those affecting the PEPFAR global AIDS program, creating uncertainty for the simple-majority vote. President Trump has warned that Republicans who oppose the bill will not receive his endorsement.</p>

          <p>A mid-year review of the best books of 2025 reveals a common theme of travel, displacement, and the transformative power of encountering the unknown. The selected works explore the concept that all stories are fundamentally about a person going on a journey or a stranger arriving in town. The recommended titles are divided into 'whimsical' and 'harrowing' journeys, featuring diverse narratives from a Shakespearean actress's New York walkabout to a real-life couple's four-month survival ordeal on a life raft. These books offer compelling explorations of how leaving home or being visited by outsiders can broaden and damage individuals.</p>

However, analysts express concern about the sustainability of this growth, pointing to persistent issues like weakened consumer confidence and a deepening property crisis.

In New Jersey, first responders conducted numerous water rescues and dealt with a house explosion in North Plainfield. Westchester County, New York, also experienced rapid flooding, with officials closing major parkways and rescuing stranded drivers. The extreme weather event highlights the region's vulnerability to severe rainfall and its impact on critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A new report has found a significant increase in antisemitism across various sectors in the UK, with many Jewish people feeling ostracized at work and held accountable for events in the Middle East. The report, submitted by the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, highlights that Jewish employees in the NHS felt the issue was being ignored, and some patients felt uneasy. It also found evidence of inadvertent antisemitic tropes being used by teachers in some primary schools. Key recommendations include creating a formal antisemitism training qualification and ensuring Judaism is understood as both an ethnicity and a religion.</p>

The protests were organized by a social movement and drew a diverse crowd of activists, students, and workers frustrated with the ruling MPLA party.

Officials worry these systems may provide a false sense of security, distracting from proven home-hardening measures like brush clearance.

The piece emphasizes that modern filmmaking is inherently international, with collaborations that benefit artists and audiences worldwide.
