        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in railway ownership. The initial nationalized service commenced from Woking to Surbiton, although a bus service partially covered it. While the government emphasizes service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment, it refrained from promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservatives stress the need for Labour to fulfill its commitments. The nationalization is viewed as a watershed moment, with SWR now under the Department for Transport's control and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new policies that significantly restrict press access within the Pentagon, requiring journalists to be escorted in many areas, including the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hegseth, citing national security concerns, argues the changes are necessary to protect classified information. The Pentagon Press Association has condemned the move as an attack on freedom of the press and the public's right to know. The National Press Club also urged a swift reversal, arguing that restricting access undermines public trust. These restrictions follow previous actions limiting media access, including vacating workspaces for several news outlets and revoking the White House Correspondents' Association's ability to manage media coverage at major events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has committed to fully reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap if the party assumes power. This commitment aims to highlight divisions within the Labour party on these policies. The party plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. Keir Starmer has already announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, but Reform UK claims to be outflanking Labour on social welfare issues. The winter fuel payment provides a lump sum to pensioner households, while the two-child benefit cap restricts benefits for families with more than two children.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, prompting concerns about potential health issues among visitors. The insects have been found on the Grand Ring's walls and pillars, forcing people to avoid swallowing them. While these midges do not bite, inhaling dead ones can trigger asthma and allergic reactions, prompting health advisories for those with respiratory conditions. The insects are believed to originate from the Water Plaza, where seawater is stored, and could remain until autumn. Expo organizers are spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas, and installing insect repellent lights to combat the problem.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, which is short of the city's full staffing needs but an improvement over last year's numbers. Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue anticipates the lifeguard numbers will increase as students finish classes for the summer. The city is offering incentives, including higher hourly wages and signing bonuses, to attract more lifeguards and has also improved lifeguard stations. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards present, though some noted they had become accustomed to being more cautious due to past shortages. The city is also working to make training and qualifying easier by offering classes in multiple boroughs and relaxing some requirements.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner swap, each side releasing 307 soldiers, marking a rare instance of cooperation amidst ongoing conflict. This exchange followed a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv, which injured at least 15 people. Ukrainian officials reported shooting down numerous missiles and drones, while Russia launched another set of drone strikes on Kyiv, causing further injuries. Despite the prisoner swap, fighting continues along the front line, and diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire remain stalled. The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," has died at 90; her work redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. Published in 1975, "Against Our Will" offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault and its use as a tool of subjugation. The book's impact led to the opening of sexual assault crisis centers, self-defense classes, and the revision of laws to facilitate the prosecution of offenders. Brownmiller's work faced criticism from both the left and right, with some critics arguing that it presented an anti-male perspective, though she stood by her work and continued to advocate for women's rights.</p>

The invitation marks a shift in Canada's relationship with the Crown, with Carney campaigning heavily on standing up to Trump. While the bulk of Canada's modern population is indifferent to the British monarchy, the King's visit underscores Canada's distinct identity and traditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed West Point cadets, congratulating them and claiming credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He detailed a shift in foreign policy, criticizing past leaders for involving the military in nation-building efforts.

He also claimed a new peacetime recruiting record, though records show enlistments began rebounding before his administration. The speech came after Vice President Vance emphasized a shift away from "forever wars" at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition causing hearing, vision, and balance problems. Doctors advised against performing due to exacerbated symptoms, but Joel is undergoing physical therapy with hopes of returning to the stage. NPH occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, with symptoms often mistaken for normal aging or other conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The condition is treatable with surgery to drain excess fluid, potentially reversing symptoms and improving quality of life.</p>

          <p>Learners are finding it increasingly difficult to afford driving lessons, while instructors argue that rising prices are justified due to increased expenses. Driving instructors can set their own rates, with the most common price bracket being Â£36 to Â£40 per hour, significantly higher than in previous years. Many learners are having to cut back on other expenses to afford lessons or are taking them less frequently, prolonging the learning process. The practical test backlog is also forcing learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills. Instructors cite rising costs for vehicles, fuel, insurance, and maintenance as reasons for the higher prices.</p>

Trump's administration has also cut foreign aid and implemented strict immigration policies, contrasting with the fast-tracked arrival of white South Africans.

          <p>Victims in the trial of Joel Le Scouarnec, France's most prolific known paedophile, are expressing shock and frustration at the apparent lack of public interest in the case. Le Scouarnec, a retired surgeon, has admitted to sexually assaulting nearly 300 people, mostly children, between 1998 and 2014. Victims have formed a campaign group to pressure French authorities, accusing the government of ignoring a "landmark" case and questioning why a parliamentary commission has not been set up. Some observers suggest the lack of public engagement may stem from the extreme nature of the crimes and the discomfort associated with discussing sexual abuse of children.</p>

          <p>Young American men are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that promote a virile, traditional form of masculinity, rejecting what they perceive as feminization in Western culture. These churches, particularly the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), attract converts who feel alienated by modern American society and seek a more structured, disciplined religious environment. The converts often embrace conservative social views, including home-schooling and traditional gender roles. This trend reflects broader political shifts and a search for community among those who feel disconnected from mainstream American culture.</p>
