          <p>A coalition of advocacy groups is organizing a series of nationwide protests named "No Kings," scheduled for this Saturday, to oppose what they term abuses of power by the Trump administration. Organizers anticipate millions of participants at over 2,600 planned events across the country, with celebrity endorsements and significant advertising spending aimed at boosting turnout. In response, Republican leaders have framed the demonstrations as "Hate America" rallies, claiming they are a reason for the prolonged government shutdown, a charge that protest organizers deny.</p>

          <p>In a move to increase accessibility, Roche's subsidiary Genentech has announced it will sell its flu medication, Xofluza, directly to some patients at a discounted price. This direct-to-consumer program is designed to assist individuals who are uninsured, have limited coverage, or whose insurance plans do not cover the pill. The initiative comes as pharmaceutical companies face increasing pressure from the Trump administration to find ways to lower prescription drug costs for American consumers. The discounted cash option represents a 70% reduction from the pill's current list price.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted its sixth strike in the Caribbean Sea against a vessel suspected of drug smuggling, as part of a broader campaign to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. In a notable development, this attack on a semi-submersible vessel resulted in at least two survivors who were rescued and are now in American custody. The incident occurs amid a significant U.S. military buildup in the region, which includes warships, fighter jets, and thousands of troops. The Venezuelan government has condemned these actions as a policy of aggression and harassment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is pursuing the construction of a $250 million, privately financed ballroom at the White House, viewing the project as a key part of his architectural legacy. The administration held a dinner to recognize major financial backers of the project, which is being funded through donations collected by the Trust for the National Mall. The endeavor has drawn criticism and a formal probe from Democrats in Congress, who are raising concerns about the sources of funding and the appropriateness of such a project, introducing legislation to place restrictions on it.</p>

In an interview, she discussed her motivation for the project, emphasizing her desire to create a strong female protagonist defined by her unique skills rather than her sex appeal. Witherspoon contrasted her character with the women often portrayed in James Bond films, which she watched growing up, questioning why their roles were so often reduced to wearing bikinis.

This renewed alignment, which seems to include support from the Trump administration, is sending a strong message of deterrence to Moscow. The unified stance is seen as increasing pressure on Russia to de-escalate and potentially negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

Furthermore, China has been reducing its financial ties to the U.S. by steadily decreasing its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, signaling a long-term strategy of de-risking its economy from American policy pressures.

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned as "the wrong decision" a local authority's move to ban fans of Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending a match in Birmingham. The city's Safety Advisory Group cited security concerns and the risk of violence for the ban, referencing previous clashes involving the team's supporters. However, the decision has sparked significant controversy and criticism, including accusations of antisemitism. Following the Prime Minister's statement, the local police and crime commissioner has requested that the advisory group review its decision.</p>

          <h2>Consumers Advised on Legal Risks Even When Making Payments to Debt Collectors</h2>

          <p>This article provides guidance for consumers dealing with debt collectors, clarifying that making payments on a delinquent account does not automatically provide legal protection against a lawsuit. Unless a formal, written agreement explicitly states that legal action will be withheld, a debt collector retains the right to sue for the remaining balance. Experts advise consumers to always request payment plan terms in writing to create a formal record. They also suggest exploring options like lump-sum settlements or professional debt relief services for more structured protection.</p>

          <p>Small businesses across the United States are reportedly struggling to cope with the financial impact of President Trump's tariffs, which have significantly increased their operational costs. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less ability to absorb these duties, diversify their supply chains, or negotiate better terms with suppliers. Several business owners report being forced to take out high-interest loans, freeze hiring and investment, and raise prices on consumers to remain solvent. Economists warn that the distress in the small business sector could be a leading indicator of broader economic problems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as President Donald Trump's national security adviser, has pleaded not guilty to an 18-count indictment for allegedly mishandling classified information. Prosecutors accuse Bolton of unlawfully retaining and sharing sensitive materials, including top-secret documents, through personal messages and emails. This indictment makes Bolton the third prominent political opponent of President Trump to face federal charges in recent weeks. Bolton has publicly stated that he believes the charges are a political weaponization of the Justice Department and that his conduct was lawful.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown is persisting without the formation of bipartisan negotiating groups, or "gangs," that have helped resolve past stalemates on Capitol Hill. Democratic lawmakers attribute this breakdown in negotiations to a profound lack of trust in President Donald Trump, fearing he would renege on any potential agreement. This sentiment has created a significant obstacle to finding a compromise, as Democrats insist on an "ironclad path forward" before reopening the government. The stalemate underscores the deep partisan divisions and the impact of presidential credibility on legislative processes.</p>

          <p>A significant cultural shift is occurring within the bodybuilding community as many move away from the traditional practice of "dirty bulking," which involves consuming massive quantities of high-calorie, often processed, foods to gain mass. Instead, a method known as "lean bulking" is gaining popularity, which focuses on achieving a modest caloric surplus through healthy, whole foods. This trend reflects broader societal wellness movements and the desire for a lean, aesthetic physique year-round. However, health experts caution that even this cleaner approach can still pose risks and may lead to disordered eating habits.</p>

In response to the market jitters, investors moved towards safe-haven assets, causing the price of gold to surge to a new record high.

          <p>The Trump administration has released its proposals aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable, but the plan falls far short of the president's campaign promise to make the procedure free. The new measures consist of voluntary guidance for employers to offer fertility coverage and an agreement with a drugmaker for medication discounts via a new government website. The plan includes no new federal funding, subsidies, or insurance mandates, leading to a mixed reaction from advocates, who see it as a small step, and critics, who dismiss it as an empty gesture.</p>

The piece suggests that this stance is alienating to mainstream voters and is unlikely to succeed against Republican opposition.
