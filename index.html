          <p>Eli Lilly reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by surging demand for its popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the company's stock fell after it released trial data for its experimental oral obesity pill that did not meet high investor expectations. The pharmaceutical giant raised its full-year 2025 financial guidance but faces uncertainty from potential new tariffs on imported drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A scholar from a top Communist Party institute has suggested that China should aim for an annual GDP growth rate of between 4.5% and 5% in its upcoming five-year plan. This growth is deemed necessary to achieve the national goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035, which is estimated to be around $30,000. The article highlights this target as a key economic priority alongside technological advancement and improving citizens' livelihoods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the release of a jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected growth and significant downward revisions for previous months, President Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer. Trump labeled the revised data a "scam" and accused the agency of political manipulation, a charge that economists broadly reject. The move has sparked backlash and concerns that it could undermine the credibility of U.S. economic data, which is crucial for business decisions and Federal Reserve policy.

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and computer chips in a bid to incentivize domestic production. The President stated that companies with existing or committed manufacturing facilities in the United States will be exempt from this substantial duty. This move is part of a broader strategy to pressure businesses to onshore their supply chains and follows significant investment pledges in U.S. manufacturing by major chipmakers like TSMC, Nvidia, and GlobalFoundries.

Critics, including the Conservative Party chairman, have accused the minister of "staggering hypocrisy," while a spokesperson for Ali stated that she complied with all legal requirements.</p>

          <p>This review praises Phoebe Greenwood's debut novel, "Vulture," as a blistering and darkly comic satire about a young, clueless freelance reporter covering the 2012 Gaza War. The book is described as a collision of "Doctor Strangelove" and "M*A*S*H," exploring the self-aggrandizement and moral compromises of "misery merchants" who profit from conflict. The reviewer calls the novel a provocative and uncompromising look at the business of war, both on a geopolitical and a personal level.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Takako Yamaguchi, a 72-year-old artist currently having her first institutional show at MOCA in Los Angeles. It delves into her meticulous and time-consuming artistic process, her "contrarian streak," and her feelings of being an outsider in both the U.S. and her native Japan. Yamaguchi reflects on her long career, her identity as an L.A. artist, and the pleasure she finds in working slowly and deliberately, creating abstract works that evoke natural landscapes.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Ready for My Close-Up," examines the legacy of Billy Wilder's 1950 film noir masterpiece, "Sunset Boulevard," which has recently been praised by President Trump. The review highlights the film's complex critique of Hollywood, its blending of dark themes with sharp comedy, and its powerful performances by Gloria Swanson and William Holden. The article posits that the movie's enduring power lies in its exploration of the corrosive need for attention and the universal fear of irrelevance and mortality.</p>

          <p>New data from Homeland Security shows that arrests of undocumented immigrants by federal agents in the Los Angeles region fell significantly in July compared to the previous month. The drop from nearly 2,800 arrests to under 1,400 follows a federal court order that blocked agents from targeting people without reasonable suspicion. While the numbers have decreased, they remain higher than before the administration's aggressive mass deportation operation began in June, indicating a continued, albeit less intense, enforcement presence.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering a bill, AB 554, designed to safeguard access to HIV prevention drugs like PrEP and PEP for insured residents. The legislation would mandate that health plans cover all FDA-approved antiretroviral drugs for these regimens without cost-sharing or prior authorization. This state-level move aims to create a "shield" against potential federal actions, such as changes to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, that could threaten nationwide coverage mandates for preventive care.</p>

          <p>A new federal mandate requiring Medicaid recipients to prove they are working, in school, or volunteering is expected to have a massive impact in California. State health officials estimate that as many as 3.4 million people could lose their Medi-Cal coverage due to the bureaucratic hurdles of verifying their eligibility every six months. Health plan leaders are concerned that this will create a "labyrinth of manual verification" that disproportionately affects low-income and vulnerable populations, making it much harder to stay insured.</p>

          <p>This satirical column adopts the perspective of a narrator who believes everything in his life is rigged against him, from his bathroom scale and book sales rankings to property lines.

While supporters argue it provides necessary and convenient care, critics worry that steering too many resources to private facilities could weaken the VA's own specialized healthcare system.</p>
