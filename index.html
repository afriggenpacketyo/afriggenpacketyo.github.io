          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has developed in the Atlantic Ocean, positioned southeast of Bermuda, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center predict it will remain over open waters, strengthening to a hurricane by Monday before weakening. This storm follows Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 strength earlier in the season, causing coastal impacts despite not making landfall. NOAA had forecast an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms. The storm's trajectory is expected to take it well east of Bermuda, posing no immediate threat to land.</p>

Meanwhile, Berlin-Mitte successfully renamed Mohrenstrasse to Anton Wilhelm Amo Strasse after a years-long struggle, addressing historical racial bias. Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for social welfare spending reforms, signaling potential friction with his coalition partners, the Social Democrats. The article also touches on an open day for the German government, increasing vandalism at Catholic churches, and a commemoration for the Solingen attack anniversary.

          <p>Emine Erdogan, Turkey's first lady, has called upon Melania Trump to extend her advocacy for children to those suffering in Gaza, describing the region as a "children's cemetery." In a letter, Erdogan highlighted the severe humanitarian crisis, citing a UN-backed report that confirms famine in Gaza City and warns of malnutrition threatening 132,000 children. She implored Trump to appeal directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the crisis. This diplomatic intervention underscores the international alarm over the dire conditions in Gaza, with the health ministry reporting numerous child deaths due to malnutrition. Israel denies the famine and criticizes the IPC report.</p>

The 23-year-old, a semi-finalist last year, assured he feels "ready to go" and will not hold back in his first-round match. Draper had withdrawn from two key ATP tournaments to recover after the injury worsened during the grass-court season. His recent mixed doubles appearance at Flushing Meadows served as crucial preparation, helping him regain match sharpness. This article highlights his determination to compete at full strength.</p>

          <p>Fifteen-year-old Max Dowman made a sensational Premier League debut for Arsenal, becoming the club's second-youngest player ever. Coming off the bench against Leeds, the winger showcased his talent with dynamic runs, winning two penalties that contributed to a 5-0 victory. Manager Mikel Arteta praised Dowman's maturity, stability, and hunger, noting his unprecedented confidence for his age. Having trained with the first team since 14, Dowman's impressive pre-season performances and scoring record for the Under-18s hinted at his potential. With injuries impacting key Arsenal players, more opportunities may arise for this promising young talent.</p>

The Justice Department had classified these jurisdictions as impeding federal immigration enforcement, but the judge deemed the executive order a "coercive threat."

          <p>Thomas Frank, Tottenham's new manager, is quickly winning over fans after leading the team to consecutive wins and clean sheets, including a 2-0 victory over Manchester City. Appointed after Ange Postecoglou's departure, Frank's impressive start comes amid supporter discontent over the club's transfer window failings and chairman Daniel Levy. Despite limited player additions and key injuries, Frank's tactical approach, combining defensive solidity with attacking freedom, has transformed the team's performance. Midfielder Joao Palhinha, a loan signing, has particularly thrived under Frank, earning player of the match honors against City. This article suggests Frank's appointment is proving to be the club's most significant summer acquisition.</p>

          <p>The Ukraine war is significantly reshaping geopolitics in former Soviet states, visibly diminishing Russia's influence as exemplified by the US-brokered peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia. US President Donald Trump mediated a deal for a corridor connecting Azerbaijan's territories, marking a notable American diplomatic presence. While Russia officially welcomed the agreement, some analysts view it as a major humiliation for Moscow. Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan have also risen following a plane crash incident and other diplomatic disputes. This article suggests that Russia's preoccupation with Ukraine has created a "window of opportunity" for former Soviet states to forge new alliances and assert greater independence, with China also expanding its regional influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has declared it will not defend a decades-old federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), arguing the funding is unconstitutional. The department agrees with a lawsuit by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, claiming the program provides an unlawful advantage based on race or ethnicity. This stance cites the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action. Over 500 colleges qualify for these grants, which support institutions where at least 25% of undergraduates are Hispanic. A national association of HSIs has moved to intervene, asserting the grants are constitutional and help level the playing field for underfunded schools.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures reaching 30C on bank holiday Monday, marking what is expected to be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm spell is attributed to the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the British Isles. However, the pleasant weather will be short-lived, with cooler, unsettled conditions, including wind and rain, expected from Tuesday as the storm fully arrives. Travel disruptions are anticipated over the weekend due to rail strikes and engineering works. The prolonged dry periods this summer have also led to widespread hosepipe bans and concerns about a catastrophic harvest. This article details the weather forecast and its broader implications.</p>

While the coalition agrees on the need for social insurance reform, the SPD is likely to resist major cuts, especially given their declining vote share.
