          <p>The Department of Justice has launched an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to CBS News. This inquiry follows the DOJ's decision to drop charges against current New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Both Cuomo and Adams are mayoral candidates, adding a layer of political intrigue to the situation. The investigation's focus centers on whether Cuomo misrepresented information during his congressional testimony concerning his administration's handling of the pandemic. The probe is ongoing, and further details are expected to emerge as it progresses.</p>

          <p>Toba Aquarium in Japan houses the last two captive sea otters in the country, drawing crowds eager to witness these playful mammals. The wild sea otter population has drastically declined due to hunting for their fur and environmental pollution, exacerbated by events like the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Breeding in captivity has proven challenging, raising concerns about the species' future. The aquarium is taking measures to keep the aging otters healthy, including encouraging exercise during feeding sessions and livestreaming their activities on YouTube. Experts emphasize the importance of understanding the reasons behind the sea otters' endangered status to promote conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Louisiana State Police have apprehended another inmate who escaped from a New Orleans jail, bringing the total number of captured escapees to five, while five remain at large. The escape occurred when ten inmates broke through a cell door and a wall, eventually fleeing across Interstate 10. The sheriff's office was unaware of the escape for several hours, raising questions about security protocols. A maintenance worker at the jail has been arrested on suspicion of aiding the inmates, and the sheriff's office had previously requested additional funding to upgrade faulty cell door locks.

          <p>Senator Marsha Blackburn has introduced the Ban Birth Tourism Act, targeting foreign nationals who exploit America's immigration system to gain automatic citizenship for their children. The bill seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, rendering inadmissible any foreign national seeking a tourist visa primarily to give birth in the United States. It includes a provision to protect legitimate medical travelers, ensuring that those seeking medical treatment, rather than citizenship acquisition, are not affected. The legislation aligns with the Trump administration's focus on restoring immigration integrity and addressing concerns about the exploitation of birthright citizenship.</p>

Harris, a great-grandmother, suffered extensive burns and described the attack before her death. Johnson's execution marks the fourth in Texas this year and contributes to the ongoing debate surrounding capital punishment in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering limiting COVID-19 vaccine access to adults over 65 and those with specific medical conditions, potentially requiring further studies for healthy individuals under 65. This shift contrasts with the previous recommendation of annual COVID shots for everyone aged 6 months and older. Agency leaders believe additional doses offer uncertain benefits to younger, already vaccinated individuals. Some experts worry these restrictions will deny vaccines to those who want them, while others support the risk-based approach. Clinical trials may be required before wider vaccine approval.</p>

The project aims to defend against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, with potential funding from tax cuts and possible participation from Canada.

Hegseth has largely blamed the Biden administration for the withdrawal's execution.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto has resigned as Japan's farm minister following a backlash over his admission that he does not buy rice due to receiving it from supporters, a remark deemed insensitive amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as Eto's replacement. The controversy dealt a blow to Ishiba ahead of an upcoming election, with public support for his Cabinet at its lowest since he took office. Eto's resignation came shortly after the Agriculture Ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles in an attempt to lower prices.</p>

          <p>New photos reveal the extensive damage caused by an explosion at a Palm Springs fertility clinic, with the smell of smoke still lingering days after the incident. The blast, believed to be caused by a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, killed the suspect, 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, and injured four others. Investigators are piecing together Bartkus's motives, linking him to online writings expressing opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The IVF clinic is structurally unstable, and authorities are meticulously collecting evidence. Detectives are investigating whether Bartkus acted alone or received assistance in constructing the bomb.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the United States after a 2005 removal order. ICE is charging her $500 for each day she has remained in the country since the order was issued. The woman's attorney argues that she is eligible for residency and is the mother of three U.S. citizen children who would suffer hardship if she were deported. The case represents an enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which has historically been rarely enforced. The attorney plans to appeal the fine.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that most U.S. states do not require schools to have specific emergency plans for students with disabilities, leaving millions feeling at risk. One student with rheumatoid arthritis recounted her traumatic experience during a school shooting, highlighting the challenges faced by disabled students during evacuations. In Virginia, a new law requires public schools to create individualized safety plans for students with disabilities, aiming to address this gap. Advocates emphasize the need for schools to consider the unique needs of disabled students during emergencies to ensure their safety and well-being.</p>

The total reached 89,179, although it remains below the peak in fiscal 2018. The number of international students accepted into Japan reached a record high, driven by the popularity of Japanese subcultures and the yen's depreciation. The most common destinations for Japanese students were the United States, Australia, and South Korea. Japan aims to increase the number of domestic students studying abroad to 500,000 annually by 2033.</p>

          <p>The 'Tush Push', a signature play of the Philadelphia Eagles, is under scrutiny in the NFL, with proposals to ban it citing player safety and pace of play concerns. Despite concerns, NFL data suggests the play doesn't pose a significant safety risk due to its infrequent use. While some, like Washington Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu, view it as a 'cheapo play' akin to a rugby scrum, others, including Eagles center Jason Kelce, argue it's not particularly dangerous. The play involves the quarterback being pushed forward by teammates for short-yardage gains, sparking debate about its place in football.</p>

Testimony included accounts of a confrontation with Suge Knight, allegations of Combs blackmailing Cassie Ventura, and details of a sexual performance. Jurors also saw evidence of defaced weapons recovered from Combs' Miami Beach residence. The prosecution is building a case for racketeering and sex trafficking, while Combs' lawyers argue his private conduct does not amount to sex trafficking and that any violence was driven by love, jealousy, and drug use.

          <p>A new analysis reveals that red meat studies funded by the red meat industry are more likely to report favorable or neutral cardiovascular results compared to independently funded studies. These industry-funded studies often neglect to compare red meat to a full range of foods, including heart-healthy options like plant-based proteins and whole grains. Nutrition experts express concern that such conflicts of interest may shape public understanding of the health consequences of red meat consumption. The study underscores the need for independent nutrition research and highlights the potential impact of industry funding on scientific findings.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks shares fell despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter. The company's revenue increased 15% year over year to $2.29 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to 80 cents. CEO Nikesh Arora highlighted the company's success in platformization and the growth of its next-generation security products, particularly Cortex XSIAM. However, the stock's decline may be attributed to the company not raising its full-year outlook for key metrics, such as remaining performance obligation and next-gen security ARR. Despite the drop, analysts maintain a positive outlook on the company's long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>
