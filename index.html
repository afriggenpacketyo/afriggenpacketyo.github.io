          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth uncrewed test flight of the Starship rocket, aimed at advancing Elon Musk's Mars ambitions. The launch reached orbit, marking progress, but a propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin. SpaceX lost contact with the upper stage, expecting it to disintegrate upon reentry over the Indian Ocean. The company will review data to improve Starship's reliability, emphasizing that success comes from learning during tests. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to fully pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million. The pardon is part of Trump's pattern of using his clemency power to address what he views as the weaponization of the justice system. The Chrisleys, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," were found guilty in 2022 of financial fraud and tax evasion. Trump notified their daughter, Savannah, expressing his hope to finalize the pardon quickly, as the article indicates that Trump believes their treatment was "pretty harsh."</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his "disappointment" with the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by Republicans in the House, citing concerns over its impact on the budget deficit. Musk, who previously stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), believes the bill undermines the work his team is doing to cut spending. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the tax provisions of the bill would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034. Musk stated that a bill can be big or beautiful, but not necessarily both.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered US embassies to temporarily halt scheduling appointments for student visas, signaling a broader crackdown on foreign students. This pause comes as the administration prepares to expand social media screening and vetting for all student visa applicants. The move is part of Trump's ongoing feud with elite colleges, which he accuses of being too left-wing and enabling antisemitism. The State Department has directed embassies to remove unfilled appointments but will honor those already scheduled, as the administration seeks to tighten scrutiny of individuals entering the country.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The percentage of mothers rating their mental health as "excellent" decreased, while those reporting "fair or poor" mental health increased, especially among single parents and those with uninsured children. Researchers suggest potential factors include high housing costs, childcare expenses, and the lack of national paid parental leave. Experts emphasize that these findings can help reassure struggling mothers that they are not alone.</p>

          <p>Nitrous oxide, commonly known as "laughing gas," is increasingly misused recreationally, leading to a rise in addiction and health risks. The Annual Report of America's Poison Centers found a 58% increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide between 2023 and 2024. Regular inhalation can cause Vitamin B12 deficiency, nerve damage, and even paralysis, with deaths attributed to nitrous oxide poisonings rising significantly. Flavored nitrous oxide cans are sold in smoke shops, contributing to the rise in misuse.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found a decrease in the percentage of mothers reporting "excellent" mental health and an increase in those reporting "fair/poor" mental health. This decline occurred across all socioeconomic subgroups, with single female parents, those with lower educational attainment, and those with publicly insured children experiencing the lowest health status. The findings underscore the need for greater attention to maternal mental health.</p>
