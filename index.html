          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, citing attacks on ICE officers and federal law enforcement. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the deployment is necessary due to violent mobs inhibiting the execution of laws. Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, asserting that local authorities have sufficient resources. The White House released a memo stating that protests inhibiting law enforcement constitute a form of rebellion, leading to the call for federalizing the National Guard. Optimism is low considering the escalatory nature of the situation and the conflicting statements from federal and state officials.</p>
