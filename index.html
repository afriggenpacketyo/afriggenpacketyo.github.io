          <p>European leaders, including those from Poland, the UK, France, and Germany, have urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, starting on Monday, to reconnect Ukraine's economy and reunite families. The announcement was made after discussions with US President Donald Trump, who initially suggested an unconditional ceasefire. The leaders threatened Russia with severe sanctions if it fails to comply. Russia has previously insisted on halting Western military aid to Ukraine before considering a ceasefire, but Zelensky maintains that any conditions undermine diplomacy, and Macron indicated the US would monitor the truce.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended to land on Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft's return evokes the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved firsts in exploring Venus. While the re-entry itself is not unusual, it serves as a reminder of the vast archive of space debris orbiting Earth and the ingenuity required to explore other planets during the early space age. The Venera program ended in the mid-1980s and was a point of pride for the U.S.S.R.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across the southern United States, including in Atlanta and parts of North Carolina. The earthquake originated near Greenback, Tennessee, and prompted over 23,000 reports to the USGS. While no major damage or injuries were immediately reported, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness. The southeastern US carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid and Eastern Tennessee seismic zones, with the region's geology causing earthquakes to be felt over larger distances.</p>

The $750m deal covered two decades of sexual assaults by Hadden at New York hospitals. Hadden was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients to travel across state lines so that he could sexually abuse them. Victims feel institutions should protect patients rather than serial predators, and the settlement sends a clear message of accountability.</p>

Diller recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week" concept, emphasizing that research and data cannot predict public appetite. He highlights the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of projects greenlit based on instinct and a compelling story.

          <p>Migratory birds are significantly impacted by climate change, altering their traditional routes and behaviors. Rising global temperatures and extreme weather events affect their food sources and resting places, leading to shorter routes or complete abandonment of original habitats.

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire to de-escalate tensions following an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. The announcement was first made by President Donald Trump, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker the ceasefire. However, Indian officials stated that the ceasefire was worked out directly between the two countries. Tensions had been rising due to attacks and cross-border fire, with civilian casualties reported on both sides.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy as the diet industry faces increased competition from weight loss injections like Mounjaro and Ozempic. The company, which once dominated the weight loss market, has lost over a million members. Weight loss injections mimic hormones that suppress appetite and make people feel full, producing rapid results for many. While WeightWatchers asserts it will continue operations, some experts express concerns about the long-term physical and psychological effects of these medications and the potential for weight regain upon discontinuation.</p>

The spacecraft, weighing nearly 500 kilograms, was tracked by space agencies due to concerns about potential dangers upon re-entry.
