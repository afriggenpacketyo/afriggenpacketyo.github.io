          <p>The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, is refusing to resign despite a public announcement of her departure by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Her lawyers state she was targeted for resisting unscientific directives and that she will not step down unless officially fired by the White House. The confrontation has led to the immediate resignation of at least three senior career officials at the CDC, who cited the "ongoing weaponizing of public health" and political interference in science as their reasons for leaving. This leadership crisis occurs just weeks after Monarez's Senate confirmation and during a period of significant changes to U.S. vaccine policy.</p>

          <p>Film producer David Brown has been federally indicted on 21 counts, including wire fraud and money laundering, for allegedly defrauding business partners out of more than $12 million. Prosecutors claim Brown solicited funds for film projects but instead used the money for personal expenses like luxury cars, home renovations, and even surrogacy costs in a "Ponzi-like scheme." The indictment alleges he concealed his history of fraud allegations from new victims to continue the operation. Brown, known for producing films such as "The Fallout" and "The Apprentice," is currently in federal custody and will be arraigned in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>A new NATO report indicates that for the first time, all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three nations—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting a newly agreed-upon, more ambitious goal of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitments must be translated into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence.</p>

          <p>The Danish government has summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report from its public broadcaster, DR, alleging that individuals with connections to President Trump are conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. The report, citing multiple government and security sources, claims the goal is to foment a secessionist movement to weaken Greenland's ties with Denmark, potentially paving the way for U.S. annexation of the strategically important Arctic territory. While the State Department stated it does not direct the actions of private citizens, Denmark's Foreign Minister declared any interference in the kingdom's internal affairs to be unacceptable.</p>

Hillary Scholten (D-MI) and Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) acknowledge the pervasive sense of danger but are working together to address the issue, emphasizing that lawmaker safety is not a partisan concern.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two employees of an Ontario, California surgery center on felony charges of assaulting and obstructing federal officers. The staffers, Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, are accused of physically interfering with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as they attempted to arrest an unauthorized immigrant who had fled into the medical facility. Video of the July incident showed employees demanding a warrant and attempting to block the agents from detaining the man. The indictment signals a continuation of the U.S. Attorney's assertive stance on prosecuting individuals who interfere with federal immigration operations.</p>

          <p>The controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to an email from a state official. The facility, which has been the subject of legal challenges that halted the intake of new detainees, was visited by President Trump and was projected to cost approximately $400 million. The head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, confirmed the imminent emptying of the center in a communication with an interfaith community group. This development comes as Governor Ron DeSantis's administration plans to open a new immigration facility called "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, forecasting sales growth to remain above 50% for the upcoming quarter, signaling continued high demand for its AI infrastructure products. Despite the strong performance, the company's stock saw a slight dip in extended trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year to $41.1 billion, fell just short of analyst expectations. The results confirm Nvidia's central role in the global AI buildout, though this quarter marked its slowest growth period in over two years.

          <p>Experts warn that California is increasingly susceptible to massive dust storms, known as haboobs, due to factors exacerbated by climate change such as drought, water overuse, and wildfires. These storms, similar to one that recently hit Phoenix, can create towering walls of dust and carry particles hundreds of miles, posing significant health risks by transporting toxins, pesticides, and fungal spores like those causing valley fever. Researchers at the UC Dust consortium estimate that over 5 million Californians are already affected by this growing air quality problem. The phenomenon also impacts infrastructure by coating solar panels and accelerates snowmelt in mountain regions.</p>

          <h2>UK Charity Finds Success in Preventing Homelessness by Giving Direct Cash Grants</h2>

          <p>A charity named Greater Change is tackling homelessness by providing direct, no-strings-attached cash payments to individuals at risk of losing their homes. The organization reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, with the funds typically used for rent deposits, bills, or clearing debts. This approach, known as direct cash transfer, is based on international evidence suggesting that people in crisis make responsible financial choices when given agency. While the scale is small, Greater Change argues the model saves taxpayer money in the long run by preventing the higher costs associated with long-term homelessness.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed author Jacqueline Wilson is releasing "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her 1999 children's novel "The Illustrated Mum." The new book revisits sisters Dolphin and Star, now in their 30s, as they continue to navigate life with their mother, Marigold, who has bipolar disorder. Wilson describes writing the sequel as both the "easiest and hardest" book of her career, as she felt compelled to portray a realistic, and not always happy, continuation of their lives. She reflects on her career of tackling difficult themes like mental illness and messy families, emphasizing her commitment to writing stories that are true to life.</p>

          <p>Documents from the UK's data regulator reveal that Ministry of Defence (MoD) staff had been explicitly warned about the risks of sharing spreadsheets with hidden data tabs prior to a major 2022 leak. That breach exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghan nationals who had applied for UK resettlement, an error expected to cost around £850 million. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) memo shows the MoD was aware of the specific risk that led to the incident. Internal ICO communications also show staff questioning why the regulator did not issue a fine to the MoD for the massive breach.</p>

          <p>China has rapidly become the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and exporter, a trend that is fundamentally altering the global car industry. Propelled by massive government subsidies and a robust battery supply chain, companies like BYD have overtaken legacy automakers and even Tesla in production volume. This surge has led to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, which have imposed tariffs to protect their domestic industries from what they allege are anti-competitive practices. Analysts predict China will produce four out of every ten cars globally by 2030, cementing its dominance and forcing international competitors to adapt to the new landscape.

          <p>Following Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer pushed back against growing concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble. He argued that the massive AI-related spending by major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google is a worthwhile investment, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer acknowledged that while Nvidia's stock dipped slightly after its report, the underlying demand is real and driven by competent industry leaders with strong balance sheets. He compared the current moment to the early days of Amazon, suggesting that betting against this technological shift would be a mistake. (not investment advice)</p>

The result sealed a 9-1 aggregate defeat, eliminating Rangers from the Champions League play-offs and intensifying scrutiny on Martin's leadership. Despite the record-equalling European loss and a team selection that raised eyebrows, Martin insists he has no concerns about his future and plans to use the embarrassing defeat as motivation for the upcoming Old Firm derby against Celtic.</p>

          <p>In a provocative political move, Republicans in the California assembly have proposed a "two-state solution" that would split the state, separating the liberal coastal areas from the more conservative inland regions. The proposal is a direct response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that seeks to redraw the state's congressional districts, which Republicans have labeled a "gavinmander." While the plan to create a new state is highly unlikely to succeed, it serves as a powerful messaging tool for Republicans arguing that the redistricting effort would silence rural and conservative voices. Democrats have dismissed the proposal as a political stunt and a gerrymander in its own right.</p>

          <p>President Trump used his social media platform to attack late-night host Seth Meyers and NBC, questioning why the network would extend the contract of someone he described as having "no Ratings, Talent, or Intelligence." The post referred to a contract extension for "Late Night With Seth Meyers" through 2028, which was publicly announced in May 2024. The article contextualizes Trump's criticism within his long-standing feud with Meyers, which dates back to Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. This continues a pattern of the president targeting late-night comedians who are critical of his administration.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Conservative party is facing a potential existential threat from the right-wing Reform UK party, which is now consistently outperforming them in Holyrood opinion polls. The challenge has intensified after a third Conservative MSP, Graham Simpson, defected to Reform, following a dozen local councillors who made the same move. This trend is forcing Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay into a difficult position, as shifting his party further right to compete with Reform risks alienating the moderate, centre-right voters who previously helped the party become Scotland's second-largest. The dynamic signals a significant realignment on the right of Scottish politics.</p>

Despite an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties as a key Allied power, Beijing now finds itself frequently cast as a revisionist adversary by Western nations, particularly the G7. The article suggests that China aims to use the anniversary to assert its role as a guarantor of the post-war order, challenging the narrative that its growing influence is inherently destabilizing. This reflects a fundamental disagreement over the nature and leadership of the global system established after the conflict.</p>

The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, killed an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injured 17 others by firing a rifle through the church windows during a school Mass. Authorities report that Westman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene, had scheduled a manifesto to be released on YouTube containing "disturbing writings."
