          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 21:55:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has announced his intention to designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." This move follows a similar, unfulfilled promise made during his first term in 2020 amid widespread protests. The announcement comes in the wake of the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with Trump vowing to investigate organizations that fund what he terms "radical left political violence." It remains unclear what the legal framework or practical implications of such a designation would be, as antifa is not considered a formally structured group.</p>

          <p>In a keynote address at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun articulated China's positions on several critical security issues. He emphasized the importance of historical lessons from war while marking the anniversary of the 9/18 Incident. Reaffirming China's stance on Taiwan, Dong described its return as integral to the post-war order and stated the People's Liberation Army would never permit separatist plots or foreign interference to succeed. The speech also addressed ongoing tensions in the South China Sea and China's perspective on regional security blocs formed by United States allies.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell approximately 10% in after-hours trading following a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report and a controversial, now-reversed, rebranding effort. While revenue slightly exceeded expectations, adjusted earnings per share fell short, and the company projected lower-than-expected revenue for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Julie Masino acknowledged the intense customer backlash to the new, modern logo, which critics called "soulless." The company has since reverted to its original branding, halted restaurant remodels, and is launching a new feedback initiative to reconnect with its customer base.</p>

          <p>ABC has indefinitely preempted its late-night program "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments regarding the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In his monologue, Kimmel accused the "MAGA gang" of attempting to score political points from the tragedy. The decision followed announcements from major station owners, including Nexstar Media, that they would no longer air the show, calling the remarks offensive. The move has drawn praise from former President Trump and sparked broader debate about speech and consequences in the media landscape.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting in York County, Pennsylvania, resulted in the deaths of three law enforcement officers and left two others in critical but stable condition. The incident occurred as officers were conducting a follow-up on a domestic-related investigation. The suspected gunman was shot and killed by police during the confrontation, and authorities have stated there is no ongoing threat to the community. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro described it as a devastating day, ordering flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of the fallen officers.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis announced in a memo to employees that the struggling carrier will slash its flight capacity by 25% in November and that more job cuts are forthcoming.

The company is currently in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors to shrink its operations and focus on its most profitable markets. The announcement adds to the uncertainty for employees, following previous furloughs and demotions of hundreds of pilots.</p>

While Japan's market saw significant gains, other Asia-Pacific markets had a mixed reaction, with South Korea's Kospi rising and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 declining.

The Academies' findings assert that the scientific certainty of climate change has only strengthened since 2009 and that the U.S. faces a future of worsening climate-induced harm.

Scientists measured the alcohol content in figs and plum-like fruits that are staples of the chimpanzee diet, finding it to be low but significant when consumed in large quantities. The study provides the first direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of primate ancestors.

The match also featured the debut of £125m record signing Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs before being substituted after 58 minutes. While the dramatic finish thrilled fans at Anfield, the team's recurring defensive lapses remain a concern for head coach Arne Slot.</p>

          <p>During his second state visit to the United Kingdom, former President Donald Trump praised the "irreplaceable and unbreakable" bond between the two nations at a lavish banquet hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The day was filled with elaborate ceremony, including a military welcome and a carriage procession, which Trump called one of the highest honors of his life. However, the visit also drew significant opposition, with an estimated 5,000 people marching in London to protest his presence.

In response, Newsom's team clarified that applications for new multi-unit developments in the Palisades burn zone are currently banned by an emergency order from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a cautious move intended to balance weak jobs reports against the risk of inflation. This decision comes amid an unprecedented pressure campaign from former President Trump, who has publicly demanded more significant cuts and attacked the central bank's independence. The move is further complicated by the administration's attempt to oust Fed board member Lisa Cook and the recent appointment of Stephen Miran, who remains a member of the Trump administration. The modest cut signals the Fed is still acting independently, for now, despite the intense political environment.</p>

          <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to maintain the current 4% interest rate when they meet on Thursday. This anticipated decision follows a recent rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and comes after UK data showed inflation remains at 3.8%, nearly double the Bank's target. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee had previously lowered the rate from 4.25% in August to its lowest level in over two years. Analysts believe that with inflation still elevated, further cuts are unlikely for the remainder of the year.</p>
