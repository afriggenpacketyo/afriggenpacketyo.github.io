          <p>During a Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, a fan, identified as Kavan Markwood, fell from the right-field bleachers onto the warning track, sustaining critical injuries. The incident occurred moments after Andrew McCutchen hit an RBI double, causing a delay of about 10 minutes. Pittsburgh Public Safety is treating the incident as accidental and are not anticipating providing any additional updates to the public. The Pirates organization expressed their thoughts and prayers for the fan and his family, with McCutchen also posting a message of support on social media.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton shares his perspective on the first 100 days of President Trump's second term, describing it as incoherent and driven by Trump's desire to be the center of attention. Bolton argues that Trump lacks a grand strategy or coherent policy approach, and his decisions are often reactions rather than well-thought-out plans. While acknowledging concerns about constitutional infringements, Bolton believes that U.S. institutions are strong enough to withstand Trump's actions, and many of his efforts will ultimately fail in the courts.</p>

The American Beverage Association argues that the tax unfairly burdens working families already struggling with high prices, while supporters say it will help combat the dangers of sugary drinks.</p>
