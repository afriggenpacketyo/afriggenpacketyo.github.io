        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart is content with the recent drop in resale prices for its popular Labubu monster toy, despite previous markups of over 2,000%. The company stated its products are intended for art appreciation and joy, not profit-making, aiming for a more sustainable model. This shift follows increased production to meet demand and complaints about scalpers, with Pop Mart now churning out 30 million plush toys monthly. Analysts view the secondary market as a barometer for product popularity, and while Pop Mart's shares have fallen recently, they remain significantly up year-to-date. The article suggests this move could help the company avoid being a one-hit wonder and focus on long-term customer engagement.</p>

          <p>Shares of Asian pharmaceutical companies experienced declines after U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs, including a 100% duty on branded or patented pharmaceutical products. Major Japanese and South Korean pharma stocks, such as Daiichi Sankyo, Chugai Pharmaceutical, Samsung Biologics, and SK Bio Pharmaceuticals, saw significant drops. Hong Kong-listed companies like Alibaba Health Information Technology and JD Health were also affected. This announcement, alongside tariffs on heavy trucks and home furnishings, influenced broader Asian markets, with South Korea's Kospi leading losses. The article contextualizes these market movements within Trump's broader trade policies and Japan's inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Imposes 25% Tariffs on Imported Heavy Trucks Starting October 1</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 00:39:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks, effective October 1, as part of his strategy to boost domestic manufacturing and protect U.S. producers. This measure aims to shield companies like Peterbilt and Kenworth from foreign competition, aligning with broader tariffs on goods such as branded drugs and kitchen cabinets. The decision follows investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security concerns. While intended to help domestic industry, experts warn that these tariffs could increase prices for American consumers and manufacturers, especially if input materials also face high duties. Mexico was the largest exporter of medium- and heavy-duty trucks to the U.S. last year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's critical infrastructure, including airports and military bases across Jutland, has been targeted by drone incidents, exposing the nation's vulnerable defenses. While no harm or damage has occurred, the systematic nature of the attacks has led the Defence Minister to label it a 'hybrid attack,' with Russia not ruled out despite denials. The country, a founding NATO member, is grappling with how to respond, having refrained from shooting down drones due to safety concerns. This situation highlights a broader issue faced by several NATO eastern flank nations, prompting discussions on a potential 'drone wall' for EU borders. Denmark's cautious approach contrasts with Poland's more aggressive stance against recent Russian drone incursions.</p>

Oz emphasized that acetaminophen is considered the safest medication for fevers during pregnancy, with medical experts stressing the lack of established causation between Tylenol and autism. The medical community fears that the administration's warnings could lead pregnant women to use less safe pain relievers. Oz, while advocating transparency, urged caution against self-medicating without consulting a physician, highlighting the ongoing debate and lack of definitive evidence.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's irritation with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is becoming increasingly evident as Labour confronts the rising challenge from Reform UK. Starmer views the populist right as a generational threat, accusing them of preying on working people's concerns. Burnham's repeated interventions, suggesting a lack of clear direction from the government, have privately irked Downing Street and many Labour MPs. The prime minister's comparison of Burnham to former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss underscores the depth of his annoyance, indicating a serious internal party struggle. This dynamic is set against the backdrop of Labour's broader effort to define its identity and tackle its critics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced new import taxes, effective October 1, including 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets, 30% on upholstered furniture, and 25% on heavy trucks. Citing national security and other reasons, Trump aims to reduce the budget deficit and boost domestic manufacturing. These tariffs add uncertainty to the U.S. economy, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and impacting job growth, as warned by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The pharmaceutical tariffs offer an exemption for companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S. Critics, including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, warn of potential harm to Americans' health and increased costs across affected sectors.

Pharmaceutical imports reached nearly $213 billion in 2024, and experts caution about potential price hikes and medication shortages.

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The charges stem from his September 2020 testimony regarding an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, where he allegedly lied about authorizing an anonymous source for media reports. Notably, the grand jury rejected a third charge of making a false statement related to a question from Senator Lindsey Graham. Comey has declared his innocence, stating he will not live 'on his knees' and has confidence in the judicial system. This indictment, occurring just days before the statute of limitations expired, has intensified concerns about political retribution.</p>

This stark contrast to typical federal indictments, which offer damning specifics, fuels fears of a politically motivated prosecution. The article notes that the Justice Department's own inspector general's office previously supported Comey's account in a related leak dispute.

          <p>Geoffrey Todd West, 50, was executed by nitrogen gas in Alabama for the 1997 capital murder of store clerk Margaret Parrish Berry. Despite West's private apologies to Berry's family and her son Will's plea for clemency, Governor Kay Ivey allowed the execution to proceed. West, who expressed regret for his actions, was pronounced dead after appearing to struggle for breath during the nitrogen gas procedure. This marks one of two executions in the U.S. on Thursday, and the sixth time Alabama has used nitrogen gas since 2024. The Federal Defenders Office criticized the denial of a meeting between West and Berry's son, calling it a 'lost opportunity' for healing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a memorandum to establish a comprehensive strategy against 'domestic terrorism,' specifically targeting what he calls a radical left-wing 'terror network.' This move, prompted by recent political violence, has sparked fierce legal pushback and fears of a broad crackdown on political opponents and non-profit organizations. Trump suggested billionaires like George Soros and Reid Hoffman could be targets for funding such groups. Civil liberties advocates, including the ACLU, condemn the memorandum as a dangerous attempt to stigmatize activists and misuse federal law enforcement powers. The article highlights concerns that existing laws could be weaponized against ideological opponents, eroding fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's 'Department of Government Efficiency' (Doge) is facing questions regarding the involvement of tech start-up investor Harriet Green in its efforts to identify cost savings at West Northamptonshire Council. Green, whose firm Basis Capital invests in companies that work with or compete against local government, is proposed to access sensitive council data. Local councillors have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and whether businesses backed by Basis could gain an unfair advantage.

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged nearly half a million books were illegally pirated to train its chatbots. The agreement, which will compensate authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per book, does not apply to future works. This article notes that the Association of American Publishers views this as a significant step towards holding AI developers accountable for infringement. Anthropic expressed satisfaction with the approval, emphasizing that the court's prior ruling on AI training as transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement is seen as a milestone in authors' fight for their rights, pushing AI companies toward legal licensing.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would not permit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, stating, 'It's not going to happen.'

Trump also indicated progress on a Gaza deal, suggesting it was 'pretty close.' Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, barred from traveling to New York by the U.S., addressed the UN General Assembly via video link, welcoming a French-proposed peace plan.

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, seeks to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services, ensuring they don't blast louder than the content. The bill was inspired by the experience of parents whose baby was repeatedly woken by jarringly loud ads. While federal law (CALM Act of 2010) already regulates traditional TV broadcasters, streaming services are currently exempt. Due to California's significant market influence, this state-level legislation could effectively set a national standard. The bill, which has passed the state Senate, faces opposition from the Motion Picture Association, but proponents argue that streaming platforms possess the technical capability to control ad volume. This article highlights a consumer protection issue with potentially widespread impact.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm of the season, is swirling north of the Caribbean and, while not expected to make landfall, could interact with another developing system. This potential interaction could lead to the rare 'Fujiwhara effect,' where two storms merge or orbit each other. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan explains that the outcome depends on the storms' characteristics, with a stronger system typically absorbing a weaker one. The National Hurricane Center is monitoring a second system near Humberto, which is forecast to strengthen into a tropical depression.

The events at Wounded Knee, often described as a massacre, involved the U.S. Army killing an estimated 250 Lakota Sioux, including women and children.
