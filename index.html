          <p>Actor Josh Duhamel shared his preparations for a potential apocalypse at his Minnesota home, which he jokingly calls his "doomsday cabin," during an interview. While he estimates he's 70% ready, he acknowledges the need to improve his hunting and fishing skills, as well as stockpile more food. Duhamel, who left Hollywood to live off-grid, values the opportunity to reconnect with basic skills and escape technological distractions. He clarifies that his retreat is more about staying true to his roots than strictly preparing for doomsday, but having survival skills is beneficial. The cabin provides a respite from technology and a chance to focus on essential needs. The actor also mentioned that AI scares him. This is why he has decided to move off grid.</p>

          <p>A report commissioned by the Australian government examines the feasibility of implementing a social media ban for individuals under 16. The report, conducted by the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme, explored various age verification methods, including formal identification, parental approval, and facial assessment technology. While technically feasible, the report found no single solution guaranteed to be effective across all scenarios, noting privacy and accuracy concerns with each method. The Communications Minister said that the report showed age checks could be "private, efficient and effective". She noted that the tech companies are at the forefront of AI and that they should be able to use the data and tech to keep kids safe online.</p>

Founded in 2001, the SCO serves as a Eurasian security bloc that has expanded to include trade, economics, and cultural cooperation among its ten member states. It is viewed as an Asian counterweight to the West. Leaders are expected to sign a declaration and strengthen security and economic ties. The summit underscores China's growing influence in the region and its commitment to multilateral cooperation.</p>

          <p>A new book recounts an incident where Queen Camilla, as a teenager, fought off an attempted indecent assault on a train. According to 'Power and the Palace,' Camilla, around 16 or 17 years old at the time, used her shoe to defend herself against a man who was touching her. She reported the incident to station staff, leading to the man's arrest. Buckingham Palace has not disputed the account. The story has come to light given the Queen's recent public work in recent years which has been supporting the victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD experienced a significant drop following the release of their quarterly profit report, which revealed a 30% decrease compared to the previous year. The decline is attributed to an aggressive price war within the Chinese electric vehicle market. Despite expanding sales overseas, BYD's profits were impacted by the competitive domestic environment. This highlights the challenges faced by EV makers in China amid intense market rivalry.</p>

The Justice Department acknowledged that deportation planes were prepared but would comply with the order. The Trump administration argued they were repatriating the children to reunite them with relatives, but lawyers for the children disputed these claims.</p>

          <p>Israel claims to have killed a spokesperson for Hamas' Qassam Brigades in an airstrike in Gaza City. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had targeted Abu Obeida, but it was not known whether he had been killed. Defense Minister Israel Katz later announced Obeida's death. The military's Arabic-language spokesperson has urged Palestinians in Gaza City to flee south. The operation is part of Israel's effort to dismantle Hamas' military capacity. At least 43 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday, according to local officials.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military troops to Chicago, calling it an "invasion." Pritzker argued that President Trump has "other aims" besides cracking down on crime, suggesting a plan to influence the 2026 elections. The White House rejected Pritzker's accusations, citing the city's high crime rate. Trump called Pritzker a "weak and pathetic Governor" and threatened intervention. The situation has sparked a debate over federal authority and the role of the military in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's first lunar rover as part of NASA's Artemis program, aiming to find water and measure radiation levels on the lunar surface. The 35kg rover, scheduled for launch in 2029, will land in the Moon's south polar region, facing extreme temperature challenges. The mission seeks to demonstrate Canadian technology and contribute to establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon. The rover does not have a name yet. The Canadian Space Agency held an online competition to select one, and is expected to announce the winner in the future.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly suspended visa approvals for nearly all Palestinian passport holders, according to the New York Times. The restrictions extend beyond previous limitations on visitors from Gaza. This move could prevent Palestinians from accessing medical treatment, education, and business travel in the U.S. The State Department previously halted visitor visas for individuals from Gaza. The Trump administration has also begun denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian Authority (PA).</p>

          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever expansion of publicly funded childcare support has begun, offering more help to working parents with nursery costs. Eligible parents can now access 30 hours of childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. However, parents are facing long waiting lists due to staff shortages at nurseries. Research suggests workforce issues, including low pay, could hinder the delivery of the promised offer. Some parents are going to extra lengths to make themselves eligible for the funded hours as early as possible.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) is actively engaged in espionage within the U.S., targeting both foreign powers and Chinese dissidents. The MSS is considered the largest and most active spy agency globally, employing various methods such as cyberattacks and human intelligence. They monitor Chinese expatriates, infiltrate college campuses, and use coercion to recruit spies. Cases of Chinese espionage in the U.S. have led to indictments for harassment, hacking, and spying. The FBI is actively working to counter these activities. As a result, the FBI has successfully thwarted numerous espionage attempts.</p>

          <p>Global demand for matcha has skyrocketed, leading to supply shortages and soaring prices in Japan. Japan exported 36.4 billion yen ($247 million) of green tea last year, four times more than a decade ago. Tencha prices at auction jumped 170% from the year before. Many retailers have reported that matcha prices have doubled in the last year. The Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to encourage more tencha cultivation. The boom has forced Ito En, the world's largest seller of bottled green tea, to create a dedicated division.</p>

The music is experiencing a resurgence as young audiences two-step once again, to those accordions, fiddles and wash-boards. Artists like Jourdan Thibodeaux emphasize the importance of living and maintaining their culture. The music serves as a transmitter of culture and language.
