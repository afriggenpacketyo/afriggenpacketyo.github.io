          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, urging member states to bolster artificial intelligence cooperation while denouncing a 'Cold War mentality.' The summit, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, serves as a platform for China to project itself as a global peacemaker amid ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's $84 billion investment in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education, aiming to foster a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation within the bloc. The gathering is expected to conclude with a joint statement on strengthening security, economic, and cultural ties among its now ten member states.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD fell nearly 8% after the company reported a 30% year-over-year slump in second-quarter net profit. This significant decline, to 6.36 billion yuan ($891 million), occurred despite a 14% revenue growth driven by expanding overseas sales. The company attributed its reduced profitability to an aggressive price war within China's competitive EV market, noting increased price competition and excessive marketing as adverse impacts on the industry. Chinese authorities have previously warned carmakers against fueling these price cuts, indicating concerns over market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.5. This figure, which indicates expansion, surpassed Reuters' economist estimates and marked the fastest growth rate since March, partly attributed to a prolonged trade truce with the U.S. The improvement was driven by a recovery in new export orders, showcasing resilience in external demand despite tariffs. However, muted gains in overall output and new orders suggest domestic demand remains weak, and rising raw material costs are prompting businesses to pass on expenses to consumers.

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocacy groups sought an emergency injunction, arguing the children would face abuse and persecution upon return. While the Guatemalan president and U.S. justice department lawyers claimed the children were being repatriated for family reunification, advocacy groups disputed this, citing pending immigration cases and credible fears of return. The order, in place for 14 days, covers all unaccompanied children at risk of deportation, preventing their removal without proper assessment of their claims.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Tianjin, signaling a potential warming of relations amidst U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian imports. The meeting, which saw promises to work through differences, reflects India's policy of 'strategic autonomy' as it balances ties with both the U.S. and China. Despite a brief border conflict in 2020 and a burgeoning trade deficit with China, India is seeking new opportunities after facing pressure from a trusted ally. The renewed synergy, however, could face geopolitical challenges, particularly with India hosting the Quad summit, a forum often seen as a counter to China's regional dominance.</p>

          <p>The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has officially withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify, citing new information about his health. Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller as part of the committee's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, given Mueller's tenure as FBI director from 2001 to 2013. Mueller's family informed The New York Times that he is battling Parkinson's disease, which precludes him from appearing before Congress. This development brings a halt to the committee's efforts to question Mueller regarding his knowledge of Epstein's investigations during his time leading the FBI.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott shared his perspective on the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Prescott, the NFL's highest-paid player, stated he wasn't surprised by the move, attributing it to the personal nature of Parsons' contract negotiations with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. The trade saw Parsons become the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL with a four-year, $188 million deal, while Dallas acquired two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Prescott expressed relief that the tension between Parsons and Jones had reached a resolution, avoiding ongoing distractions for the team.</p>

          <p>Preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center, indicates that over 1.2 million immigrants have left the U.S. labor force between January and July under President Trump's intensified immigration policies. This decline impacts various sectors, with immigrants comprising significant portions of workers in farming, construction, and service industries. Experts note that immigrants typically contribute at least 50% of U.S. job growth, and the reduced influx of migrants has significantly affected job creation capacity. The policies, while targeting 'dangerous criminals,' have also led to the detention of many without criminal convictions and a plunge in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>Private surveys indicate that U.S. tariffs have adversely affected factory activity across much of Asia, with manufacturing shrinking in export powerhouses like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This trend raises concerns about the ability of Asian manufacturers to sustain profits as exports weaken in the coming months. In contrast, China's RatingDog General Manufacturing PMI surprisingly rose to 50.5 in August, indicating growth and bucking the regional trend, despite an official survey showing contraction. Analysts suggest that while China shows some resilience, the broader Asian economies face a 'double-whammy' of U.S. tariffs and competition from cheap Chinese exports, intensifying pressure on policymakers.</p>

Identity document verification is deemed most accurate but raises privacy concerns regarding data retention and sharing. Facial assessment technology, while 92% accurate for adults, has a 'buffer zone' around age 16, leading to potential inaccuracies.

This assertion came after a U.S. judge temporarily halted the children's removal, following reports of planes being loaded for deportation. Guatemala's statement on social media platform X emphasized its desire to prevent children from remaining in shelters and detention centers, and its commitment to family reunification and social programs for the returning children. This perspective contrasts with the National Immigration Law Center's view, which argues the U.S. administration violated federal laws by attempting to send children away without completing asylum claims.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal that Vietnam has significantly expanded its military footprint across all 21 features it occupies in the contested Spratly Islands, including the creation of artificial land. This reclamation effort, which includes infrastructure like munitions storage, puts Vietnam on track to surpass China in land reclamation in the archipelago. Maritime analysts suggest these actions solidify Vietnam's claims and could prompt Beijing to upgrade its own defense posture in the South China Sea. The Spratlys are also claimed by Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei, making it a complex and sensitive geopolitical flashpoint.</p>

The bond is so significant that the daughter and granddaughter of the Flying Tigers' founder are among the few Americans invited to Beijing's military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of WWII's end.
