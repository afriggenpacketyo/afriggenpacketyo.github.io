          <p>An Israeli ground, air, and sea attack in north Gaza has reportedly killed nearly 100 people, including children, according to Hamas-run civil defense and local residents. The attack, which marks the largest ground assault on north Gaza since March, involved bombing of homes and tents housing civilians. Witnesses reported smoke bombs, artillery shelling, and tanks in Beit Lahia, with Israeli aircraft dropping leaflets calling for immediate evacuation, sparking panic among displaced families.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has declined in May, with Americans increasingly worried that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey. The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8, the second-lowest reading on record, while year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3%. The survey was largely completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs, highlighting the significant impact of trade policy uncertainty on consumer sentiment.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite is now unavailable on iOS worldwide after Apple blocked a bid to reinstate the game on the App Store in the U.S. Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union," the official account of Fortnite wrote in a post on social media platform X. "Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."</p>
