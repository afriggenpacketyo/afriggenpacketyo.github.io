          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, was taken into custody after the incident. Law enforcement officials are investigating the shooting as a possible targeted attack, with the suspect reportedly chanting "Free, free Palestine" after being detained. The victims were a young couple about to be engaged, according to the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. This tragic event has prompted increased security measures and condemnation from officials, including President Trump, who decried the act as antisemitism. The FBI is assisting in the investigation to determine the full scope and motive behind the attack.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers orchestrated a remarkable comeback, overcoming a double-digit deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Aaron Nesmith's impressive performance, including six consecutive three-pointers, fueled the Pacers' rally. Tyrese Haliburton hit a game-tying shot at the end of regulation. Despite Jalen Brunson's 43 points for the Knicks, the Pacers secured the victory, marking their third comeback win this season when trailing by seven or more points in the final minute of a playoff game.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent sentencing review in the UK suggests that violent offenders, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence for good behavior. The review aims to alleviate severe prison overcrowding by recommending increased use of community sentences and alternative punishments. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, warns that building more prisons alone will not solve the crisis. The proposals also include expanding domestic abuse courts and increasing electronic monitoring. However, probation officers express concerns about the additional strain on an already overburdened system, raising questions about the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed reforms.</p>

          <p>An op-ed in the New York Times discusses the claims made by some white Afrikaners in South Africa that they are experiencing institutional discrimination and targeted violence. The article refutes these claims, highlighting that white South Africans still hold a disproportionate amount of the country's wealth and land. It also points out that these claims have gained traction in American right-wing circles, particularly through figures like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump, who have offered refugee status to Afrikaners. The article suggests that these claims are an attempt to rewrite South Africa's history and cast former oppressors as victims. The piece contextualizes the complex transition from apartheid to democracy and the ongoing issues of inequality and corruption in South Africa.</p>

          <p>One year after winning the general election, the Labour government is attempting to deflect criticism by blaming the previous Conservative administration for current challenges. They cite the handover of the Chagos Islands and the sentencing review as examples of Conservative failures. The government is also exploring mandatory chemical castration for sexual offenders. This strategy raises questions about the diminishing returns of blaming their predecessors as Labour approaches its first anniversary in office, especially amidst economic difficulties and declining poll numbers. Ministers are seeking to demonstrate what they have achieved and are trying to achieve.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, while Democrats contend such a vote is illegal. California officials vow to sue if the waivers are revoked, as 16 other states and D.C. have adopted California's standards. The auto industry is divided, with some pushing for the revocation and environmental groups opposing it.</p>

          <p>Chronic water shortages in Gaza are intensifying as Israel's military operations lead to further displacement and fuel shortages for desalination and hygiene plants. The UN warns that a complete shutdown of water and sanitation facilities is possible by the end of the week without immediate fuel deliveries. Despite Israel easing some aid restrictions, fuel remains blocked, and residents are forced to drink salty water, leading to health issues. The situation is exacerbated by the increasing military offensive and new waves of displacement, making water distribution even more challenging. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports severe disruptions to water and sanitation services due to fuel shortages.</p>

The key procedural step was needed before advancing the legislation to a final vote. The bill now stipulates Medicaid work requirements will start no later than December 31, 2026, and raises the SALT deduction to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000.

Astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Fred Adams based their findings on the study of the orbital motions of Jupiter's moons, Amalthea and Thebe. Their research supports the bottom-up method of planet formation for the gas giant. This discovery provides a valuable benchmark for understanding the evolution of Jupiter and its role in the Solar System's development. The team's work gives us a new tool for understanding Jupiter and its role in the Solar System, where it is thought to have played a vital part in stabilizing the planets enough so that life could emerge on Earth.</p>

          <p>President Trump's shifting trade tactics are creating uncertainty for India and its American business partners, particularly Apple. Despite India's efforts to attract business fleeing China, Trump has changed his approach, backing off high tariffs and demanding Apple move production to the United States instead of India. Indian officials are unsure how to interpret Trump's remarks about Apple, complicating ongoing trade negotiations. The demand is a setback for India, which has been positioning itself as a viable alternative to China for American companies. Apple has been gradually shifting some of its iPhone assembly to India, but the idea of redirecting manufacturing straight to the United States has caused concern.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill that would provide $1,000 to every American baby born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, to be invested in financial markets. Initially called "MAGA accounts," the name was changed to "Trump accounts." These accounts would allow parents and third parties to contribute post-tax income, but gains would also be taxed upon withdrawal. Tax experts have expressed confusion over the purpose of these accounts, noting they function similarly to typical investment accounts without the tax advantages of retirement or health savings accounts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, a claim denied by Ramaphosa, major political parties in South Africa, and a South African court. While there is a problem with farmers being murdered in South Africa, crime statistics do not differentiate between the races of victims, and there is no evidence these murders are race-driven. Despite this, the White House released a statement doubling down on the administration's claims, citing articles from conservative media outlets. This comes as Afrikaner refugees have been fast-tracked for resettlement in the U.S. under an executive order issued by Trump in February.</p>

The EU's support aims to ensure the survival of Radio Liberty's independent journalism. The move highlights the value Europeans place on the network's work and its importance in their news ecosystem, particularly its reporting on Russia and Hungary.

          <p>The Japanese government has launched a revamped gasoline subsidy program aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers. The subsidy, which started Thursday, provides a fixed sum to wholesalers regardless of prices. The government aims to reduce wholesale gasoline prices by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further reductions planned until mid-June. The program is expected to last until the end of March 2026, with around 1 trillion yen allocated to the subsidies. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>
