          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are adjusting to a significant surge in gold prices, which have climbed over 48% globally this year and reached record highs locally. This trend is particularly impactful for wedding jewellery, a traditional cultural staple, where demand remains strong despite the increased cost. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook observe a gradual adaptation among buyers, indicating that while prices are high, the cultural importance of gold for celebratory occasions sustains its market. The article notes gold prices in Hong Kong recently hit HK$35,370 per tael, with gold for jewellery priced even higher at HK$42,840 per tael, reflecting a new market level consumers are accepting.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy intercepted several vessels of the Global Sumud Flotilla attempting to deliver aid to Gaza, detaining activists including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Israel stated the vessels were "safely stopped" for approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade, a claim disputed by the GSF. The GSF condemned the interception as illegal, alleging a vessel was rammed and communications were intentionally damaged, highlighting concerns about humanitarian access to Gaza. International reactions have been strong, with Colombia expelling Israeli diplomats and terminating a trade agreement in response.</p>

          <p>Portland police are seeking public assistance to locate a woman accused of assault near the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building after a "dialogue liaison officer" (DLO) lost track of her. DLOs, sworn officers tasked with creating a "safe space" for protesters, are restricted from enforcement actions, complicating the situation when the suspect refused a lawful order and fled. This incident raises questions about the effectiveness of the DLO program, implemented after violent 2020 protests, in balancing protest facilitation with addressing criminal activity. The case has been assigned to a detective, but no information on the alleged assault was released.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee, a 133-year-old brand, launched a viral marketing campaign, rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously address the severe unaffordability of housing in the US. The campaign acknowledges that fewer first-time buyers can afford homes, with the median age of such buyers reaching an all-time high of 38, compared to 29 in 1981. This "tongue-in-cheek" approach, designed by Rethink, aims to connect with the growing population of renters by offering an "affordable" year's supply of coffee. The initiative highlights a significant societal issue through consumer branding.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk briefly achieved an unprecedented net worth exceeding $500 billion, becoming the first individual to reach this financial milestone. This rapid wealth accumulation is attributed to the soaring valuations of his diverse ventures, including Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX. The achievement solidifies Musk's position as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of rivals like Oracle founder Larry Ellison. His fortune is closely tied to his substantial stake in Tesla, whose shares have seen a sharp increase this year as investors welcome his renewed focus on his companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge ruled against the public release of graphic crime scene photos from the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students by Bryan Kohberger. The decision prioritizes preventing "extreme emotional distress" for the victims' families, asserting that their privacy outweighs the public's interest in the investigation's conduct. While portions showing victims' bodies or immediate blood will be blacked out, other investigatory photos, videos, and documents may be released. Kohberger pleaded guilty to the murders, sparing him the death penalty, and the criminal case is now closed.</p>

Critics, including California Senator Adam Schiff, condemned the move as political retaliation and a weaponization of policy against political opponents.

          <p>Five years after launching its robotaxi service, Waymo continues to encounter operational challenges with its driverless vehicles, including a recent incident where a Waymo car reportedly ran a school bus stop sign. While Waymo claims a significantly lower crash rate than human drivers, incidents like an illegal U-turn in San Francisco highlight that the technology is still learning and requires refinement. The company, owned by Alphabet, operates in five cities with plans for expansion, but transportation safety experts emphasize the need for higher standards and proper implementation before widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>A boiler room explosion caused a partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, leaving a gaping hole in its side. Miraculously, no injuries were reported despite the significant structural damage and debris raining down onto nearby areas. Initial reports suggest the blast sent shockwaves up the chimney, leading to the collapse. Mayor Eric Adams praised the lack of casualties, calling it a avoided major disaster. Residents were evacuated, and inspections are underway to ensure the building's structural integrity, with gas services shut off for the complex.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique silent protest by "muting himself" during a press conference after Dillon Gabriel was named the team's starting quarterback. Sanders, a former college star considered a potential first-round pick, was asked for his thoughts on remaining the No. 3 quarterback. His voiceless response, characterized by smiles and gestures, is seen as a reaction to critical remarks from former NFL coach Rex Ryan. This unconventional approach highlights his frustration with his current position on the depth chart.</p>

Pike was convicted at age 18 for the brutal 1995 murder of 19-year-old Colleen Slemmer, a romantic rival, a crime that involved extreme violence and a pentagram carved into the victim's chest. Pike later showed off a skull fragment. Her attorneys argue she was a mentally ill teenager who has since changed and deserves life imprisonment, citing her history of abuse and mental health struggles.</p>

He noted that fund managers often buy Q3 winners in Q4 to showcase successful portfolios. Companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, Warner Bros. Discovery, Teradyne, Intel, and Invesco saw substantial gains, driven by AI demand, balance sheet improvements, and strategic moves.

          <p>YouTube settled a lawsuit with former President Donald Trump, paying $24.5 million after suspending his channel following the January 6 Capitol riot. This settlement, which directs funds to the Trust for the National Mall, is the latest instance of major tech companies settling similar lawsuits with Trump. Critics argue these settlements represent corporate cowardice and undermine platforms' content moderation efforts, effectively conceding that their post-insurrection decisions were wrong. The article suggests this trend allows tech giants to pivot away from moderation responsibility, reinforcing their claims of being neutral platforms.</p>

          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils, offering expert guidance on healthy choices and appropriate uses for different culinary applications. Professor Nita Forouhi emphasizes that oils like rapeseed and sunflower, despite negative perceptions, are beneficial due to their low saturated fats and high mono/polyunsaturated fats. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, with harmful trans fats largely eliminated. The article clarifies that extra virgin olive oil, with its low smoke point, is best for dressings, while vegetable or sunflower oils are superior for deep frying due to their higher heat tolerance.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has significantly increased drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, causing fuel shortages and price hikes in parts of Russia, with 21 of 38 large refineries hit this year. These strikes, some deep inside Russia, aim to damage Russia's oil industry and pressure them towards negotiations, according to President Zelensky. Ordinary Russians are experiencing long queues at petrol stations and rationing in occupied Crimea, while some smaller garages have suspended operations. While Russia's crude oil exports remain high, this campaign is intensifying the economic pain of the protracted conflict.</p>
