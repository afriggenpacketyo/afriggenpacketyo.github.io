            <p>Measles is resurging in 2025, with a significant outbreak in West Texas affecting primarily unvaccinated children and teenagers, resulting in multiple deaths. Cases have been reported in over 20 states, raising concerns about declining vaccination rates and the potential for widespread outbreaks. Experts emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, which provides lifelong protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. They recommend vaccination for children and booster shots for adults born before 1968 who received less effective vaccines. Measles can lead to severe complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis, and can also cause immune amnesia, increasing susceptibility to other infections.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods, aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., is unlikely to achieve its goal. According to the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, manufacturers are instead exploring alternative locations like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. The Cambodian government is considering fiscal policies, including tax credits, to help factories survive. Moody's suggests that the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs will likely pause executive decision-making regarding supply chain investments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An unusual number of sick sea lions, suffering from domoic acid toxicosis caused by a harmful algal bloom, have been attacking beachgoers in Southern California. The algal bloom, occurring for the fourth consecutive year, has spread across 370 miles of coastline, affecting the behavior of the sea lions, making them disoriented and aggressive. Experts emphasize that these animals are not naturally aggressive but are acting out of fear due to the toxins impacting their neurological function.
