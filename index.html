        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by King Charles III's former butler reveals anecdotes about the late Prince Philip's notoriously blunt and profane communication style. The article recounts several instances where the Duke of Edinburgh's unfiltered remarks, including a profane comment after Prince Harry's wedding, were perceived by some as endearing honesty while others found them rude or offensive. This behavior was well-known among palace staff, who were often nervous but also appreciative of his directness, which stood in contrast to typical royal decorum.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have developed a laboratory system to simulate the effects of a triple nuclear warhead strike on a single, deeply buried target. This experiment addresses the challenge of destroying highly fortified underground facilities with conventional weapons. The simulation allows scientists to study the impact of three high-yield nuclear explosions detonating in rapid succession, marking a significant advancement in China's research on strategic weapons capabilities and their potential battlefield applications.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is exploring unprecedented commercial leasing or development on a portion of Camp Pendleton, a vast, undeveloped stretch of Southern California's coastline. This move aligns with the Trump administration's strategy to generate revenue from public lands, but it raises significant concerns among conservationists and local communities like Oceanside. The 125,000-acre base is not only critical for military training but also serves as a vital wildlife habitat for numerous endangered species, creating a conflict between economic goals and environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>The popular Mexican confection 'acitrón', made from the biznaga barrel cactus, continues to be sold illegally despite a government ban aimed at protecting the endangered plant. Overexploitation for this traditional ingredient, used in dishes like chiles en nogada, has pushed several species of the slow-growing cactus to the brink of extinction. While some vendors and consumers feel bound by tradition, conservationists and chefs are advocating for sustainable alternatives, such as candied squash, to preserve the region's biodiversity while honoring its culinary heritage.</p>

The result concludes a strong season for Henry, who has medaled in every international race she competed in this year.</p>

          <p>Faced with housing prices that have surged over 50% since 2020, a growing number of Americans are teaming up with friends or relatives to buy homes. This trend of co-buying allows individuals, particularly single people, to pool their financial resources to overcome the significant affordability gap in the current market. While the strategy provides a path to homeownership and offers companionship, it also introduces legal and financial complexities that differ from traditional spousal purchases, prompting experts to advise drawing up detailed written agreements.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support for a permanent solution for DACA recipients, Congressional Republicans are deferring to President Trump to initiate negotiations on the program's future. As the administration ramps up its mass deportation efforts, concerns are growing for the approximately half a million individuals protected under DACA, some of whom have already been detained. While some Republican lawmakers like Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar have introduced bills offering a pathway to legal status, the broader party sentiment indicates that no significant legislative action will occur without a clear directive from the White House.</p>

          <p>Britain's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites for development. The plan, modeled on post-war housing initiatives, aims to create modern communities with at least 40% affordable housing, supported by new development corporations with powers to accelerate planning and investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that 79% of companies expect to incur 'AI debt'—the costs associated with poorly implementing artificial intelligence tools. This debt manifests as security risks, poor data quality, wasted resources, and increased employee burnout, as workers struggle with new systems without adequate training or clear use cases. Experts caution that rushing to adopt AI without proper infrastructure, strategy, and oversight can lead to counterproductive outcomes, such as creating AI-generated 'workslop' that requires significant human effort to correct.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently drive top tech talent to the Middle East, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia. These Gulf nations are aggressively investing billions to become global AI hubs, offering high salaries, a tax-friendly environment, and long-term 'golden visas' to attract skilled professionals. As the U.S. considers making it more expensive for companies to hire foreign experts, the business-friendly policies and large-scale tech projects in the Gulf present an increasingly attractive alternative for the global tech workforce.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Hainan is bracing for Typhoon Bualoi, prompting the suspension of all flights in the city of Sanya and the closure of the port in Haikou. The storm is expected to pass close to the island before making landfall in Vietnam, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. China's meteorological authority has issued a yellow alert, the third-highest level, as coastal areas across southern China prepare for the typhoon's impact, which is forecast to intensify as it moves through the area.</p>

          <p>Graham Potter has been dismissed as West Ham's manager after only eight months, marking his second sacking in a short period following his brief tenure at Chelsea. Once considered a potential successor for the England national team manager role, Potter's reputation has suffered from poor results and an inability to replicate the success he found at Brighton. His carefully built career, known for meticulous coaching and team development, has been undermined by chaotic environments at his last two clubs, leaving his future in top-tier management uncertain.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed a wide range of economic and military sanctions on Iran through the 'snapback' mechanism of the 2015 nuclear deal. Triggered by the UK, France, and Germany over Iran's nuclear escalation, the move freezes Iranian assets and penalizes its arms and missile programs. This comes as Iran's economy faces severe strain, with its currency at a record low and food prices soaring, exacerbating anxieties among its populace about their future and the potential for renewed conflict with Israel and the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team and hiring a new set-piece specialist, Newcastle United has struggled to convert dead-ball opportunities into goals this season. The team has only scored once from a corner or free-kick, a stark contrast to their upcoming opponents, Arsenal, who have scored half their goals from set-pieces. Head coach Eddie Howe has acknowledged the issue, stating that while the team has the necessary height and delivery, 'something is not quite clicking,' and they are actively working to improve this critical aspect of their game.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the proposed deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, brokered by the Trump administration, may not fully sever the platform from Chinese influence. While the framework gives U.S. investors majority ownership of the American entity, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, would remain the single largest shareholder. The author suggests that this arrangement leaves significant leverage in the hands of Beijing, potentially turning what appears to be a U.S. victory into a major strategic triumph for China's President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's contentious claims about autism, this opinion piece highlights the valuable traits often found in autistic individuals that stand in stark contrast to the president's character. The author argues that qualities such as a capacity for intense focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of empathy and social justice, and an ability to find pure joy are things the world needs more of. The article refutes the framing of autism as a tragedy, instead celebrating it as a different way of being with unique strengths.</p>
