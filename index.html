            <p>Following President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, China has accused the U.S. of using tariffs as a weapon for selfish gains, stating that this move is against the interests of the entire world. China's response includes increasing tariffs on all U.S. goods to 84% to safeguard its economy and international interests. China maintains that tariffs and trade wars have no winners and that the U.S. is prioritizing its own interests over the global community, which will face increasing opposition from other nations. The Chinese government has said they do not fear fighting trade wars. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced a significant surge after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, and lowered the rate to 10% for most countries. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 3,000 points, the S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day increase since 2008, and the Nasdaq had its largest gains since 2001. While investors are relieved by the pause, uncertainty remains due to the potential for tariffs to resume and the impact of tariffs on China, which could dampen economic growth. Delta Air Lines has already pulled its 2025 guidance due to economic uncertainty surrounding global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A new report by the Institute for Science and International Security warns that Iran's nuclear weapons program has reached an extremely dangerous stage. The report cites Iran's increased nuclear capabilities, shorter timeframes to build nuclear weapons, and internal discussions favoring weapon development as major negative factors. President Trump has stated that the U.S. will not allow Iran to possess a nuclear weapon, potentially including military action if necessary. The report also highlights Iran's military capabilities and involvement in the Ukraine war, backing Russia with arms transfers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK Cabinet Office is set to reduce its workforce by approximately one-third, cutting 2,100 civil servant jobs as part of a broader civil service reform initiative. The cuts, which will occur over the next two years through voluntary redundancies, transfers, and non-replacement of departing staff, aim to save £110 million annually by 2028. The government aims to target resources at frontline services, such as teachers, hospital appointments, and police, and the trade union Prospect warned that these cuts could harm delivery across government. The Cabinet Office has grown substantially since the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p>

            <p>Barclays has become the largest UK lender to decrease mortgage rates, with certain fixed-term deals dropping to 3.99%, amid ongoing uncertainty caused by US tariff policies. Concerns that tariffs may cause an economic slowdown has led to analysts predicting that the Bank of England will reduce borrowing costs by more than expected this year. The sub-4% rates are available to borrowers with a 60% loan-to-value ratio, and an £899 fee applies, with other lenders also cutting rates this week. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate has slightly decreased to 5.29%. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has signed an order aimed at easing restrictions on water flow from showerheads, fulfilling a promise to "make America's showers great again." The order directs the energy secretary to rescind an Obama-era regulation that limited multi-nozzle showers to a combined flow of 2.5 gallons per minute. Trump has previously complained about the difficulty of wetting his hair under current showerhead standards. Consumer and conservation groups have argued that changing the rules is wasteful and unnecessary.</p>

            <p>A new analysis suggests that Democrats face significant structural challenges, including a captured Supreme Court, gerrymandered legislatures, and the Electoral College, that could doom them to opposition status despite public opinion moving in their direction. Republicans benefit from a gerrymandered advantage in the House, and potential Supreme Court decisions could further disadvantage Democrats. The Senate map is also unfavorable, and population shifts do not favor Democrats either, potentially costing them seats in future reapportionments. The focus for Democrats must be on defending free and fair elections and building a coalition behind reforming redistricting, the courts, and statehood for Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.</p>

China and the EU are also signaling their readiness to launch market access talks and address trade frictions related to Chinese exports previously destined for the US.

            <p>Crude oil futures experienced a decline of over 2% as President Trump's increased tariffs on China overshadowed the temporary pause on higher rates for most other countries. U.S. crude oil fell to $60.59 per barrel, while Brent crude decreased to $63.76 per barrel. Despite an initial rally following Trump's temporary tariff rate of 10% on most U.S. trade partners, the decision to raise tariffs on China, a major crude importer, weighed heavily on the market.

            <p>President Trump's tariffs, particularly the increased tariffs on China, could significantly raise the cost of raising children in America. Items like cribs, strollers, car seats, and clothing, many of which are manufactured overseas, are expected to become more expensive. The Budget Lab estimates that the tariffs could cost an average household $3,800 per year, impacting families' ability to invest in their children's well-being. This policy contradicts the administration's stated goals of encouraging higher birth rates, as it makes it more difficult for families to afford the necessities for raising children.</p>

            <p>AI-powered chatbots from TurboTax and H&R Block are helping users navigate the complexities of tax filing, though experts advise caution. While these tools provide clear, bullet-pointed responses to tax questions and offer a sense of confidence, they are not meant to replace human accountants. Some experts warn that AI chatbots can provide inaccurate information and that the technology may devalue the work of human tax professionals. AI is also being used in the background to give personalized deduction recommendations and to read uploaded documents, in order to fill out forms more quickly.</p>

            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy predicts that AI costs will come down over time due to rapid advancements and increased competition in the chip market. He believes that more price-performant chips, improvements in model distillation, and other factors will reduce the cost per unit in AI. Amazon is investing heavily in AI-related projects, earmarking up to $100 billion this year on capital expenditures. Jassy also emphasized the importance of operating like a startup, eliminating bureaucracy, and taking risks to drive innovation and deliver results for customers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tariffs are taxes imposed on goods imported from other countries, with President Trump recently placing 125% tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Trump argues that tariffs will boost U.S. manufacturing and protect jobs, but economists expect them to push up prices for consumers. The UK is drawing up a list of US products it could hit with retaliatory tariffs. Stock markets have experienced volatility in response to Trump's tariff announcements, reflecting investor concerns about increased costs and reduced profits. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill, which has advanced in the Alabama House, would establish a system similar to Amber Alerts to notify the public of shark attacks.

This escalation has contributed to market uncertainty, though financial markets did initially recover after Trump's announcement.

The head of the World Trade Organization has warned that the intensifying dispute could reduce trade between the two countries by 80% and severely damage the global economic outlook.

            <p>President Trump's 90-day pause on some tariffs has provided temporary relief, but it does not address the underlying economic uncertainty caused by his trade policies. The volatility and sudden changes in trade policy have created a climate of uncertainty that is detrimental to business investment and consumer confidence. Even with the pause, tariffs remain steep and are expected to negatively impact the economy, potentially leading to higher prices and increased unemployment. The perception of the American economy now being subject to the whims of a leader with a deluded understanding of economics increases economic uncertainty.</p>
