          <h2>Biblical Principles for Choosing a Spouse Highlighted as Lessons for Modern Dating</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in Fox News explores the biblical story of Abraham finding a wife for Isaac as a guide for modern dating. The article suggests that identifying essential traits, committing to marriage, and cultivating love through giving are key principles. It contrasts this with modern dating trends, which often involve prolonged compatibility testing and casual relationships. The article argues that the Bible offers a proven formula for marital happiness, emphasizing core values and commitment over superficial preferences, and that the Hebrew language itself supports this idea, connecting love with the act of giving.</p>

          <p>The European Union has voiced strong disapproval of President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, warning that it disrupts efforts to find a negotiated solution to the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson stated that the move adds uncertainty to the global economy and increases costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU is prepared to implement countermeasures, including responses to the tariff increase, and is finalizing consultations on expanded measures. The EU had paused its countermeasures on April 14 to facilitate negotiations, but will reinstate them if no mutually acceptable solution is reached.</p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, has reported that Iran has significantly increased its production of highly enriched uranium, raising concerns about the country's nuclear ambitions. According to a confidential report, Iran now possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a level far exceeding civilian needs and approaching weapons grade. This represents a near 50% increase in the past three months, sufficient for approximately 10 nuclear weapons if further refined. The IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi expressed serious concern, while Israel accused Iran of actively pursuing nuclear weapons, a claim Iran denies.</p>

This mission continues Blue Origin's efforts in the sub-orbital passenger market, which it has dominated since Virgin Galactic paused flights in 2024, with an estimated cost of over $500,000 per seat.</p>

Hegseth had claimed that China was destabilizing the region by harassing its neighbors in the South China Sea and rapidly expanding its military.

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times warns of the dangers of downsizing NOAA during what is forecast to be an active hurricane season. The author, a hurricane specialist, argues that the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the agency, which houses the National Weather Service and hurricane hunters, would be detrimental. The author emphasizes that without NOAA's tools and data, the ability to accurately forecast hurricanes would be severely compromised, potentially leading to deadly surprise storms. The author highlights that gutting an agency that protects coastlines from disasters is not in the best interest of the economy or national security.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple parenting rules for raising highly successful kids.
