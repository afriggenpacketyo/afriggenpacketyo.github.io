          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled, necessitating direct engagement between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Bessent noted that further discussions are expected in the coming weeks, possibly including a call between the leaders. Despite a recent agreement in Switzerland to roll back tariff increases for 90 days, disagreements persist over tech restrictions on Beijing and China's limitations on rare earths. Bessent expressed confidence that China would engage constructively once President Trump communicates his preferences, emphasizing the importance of the leaders' relationship in resolving the complex trade issues. Optimism for a resolution remains contingent on high-level intervention. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's ruling that deemed President Trump's global tariffs illegal, allowing the tariffs to remain in place while the case is litigated. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly questioned the president's authority and threatened trade negotiations. The appeals court's decision provides a reprieve for the tariffs, which have been challenged by small businesses and states. Trump criticized the initial ruling and expressed hope for a Supreme Court reversal, while his administration explores alternative methods to impose tariffs if necessary. The next hearing is scheduled for June 5, and the legal battle is expected to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in the Trump administration concluded after 129 days, marked by significant spending cuts and controversies. Musk aimed to cut at least $2 trillion initially, later shifting to $150 billion, and claimed to have saved $175 billion through various measures, including workforce reductions and asset sales. His presence in the White House raised ethical concerns due to potential conflicts of interest with his companies, which have government contracts. Musk's work also led to the elimination of most USAID programs, reflecting a shift towards US isolationism, and he faced criticism for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation. His departure was confirmed by the White House, though Trump indicated Musk would continue to assist in some capacity.</p>

However, he pleaded guilty to eight felonies in 2009, including tax fraud and lying to the White House, resulting in nearly three years in prison. President Donald Trump pardoned Kerik in 2020, after which Kerik became a vocal critic of the criminal justice system and an ally of Trump, working with Rudy Giuliani to investigate claims of election fraud after the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction, involving the placement of 5,900 tons of boulders and 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) estimates the project's total cost at approximately $300 million. The OCTA acknowledged the repeated disruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs, which have forced closures of the line for over 125 years, and work will continue daily until the reopening date.</p>

Phelps, who is part of a cell-based immunotherapy trial, was informed that her treatment would be delayed by several weeks due to staff reductions. Her case has garnered attention, leading to a dispute between a Democratic senator and the US health secretary during a congressional hearing. The NIH has stated that no clinical trials have been cut, but Phelps' doctor confirmed that staff cuts have led to delays in patient care and a reduction in the number of patients treated.</p>

The project aims to enhance Beijing's position in international disarmament talks but faces challenges including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the system does not leak technological secrets, and persuading other nations to abandon Cold War-era verification methods. The AI's development is based on a protocol proposed by Chinese and American scientists over a decade ago.

Kenneth Genalo, who led Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, while Robert Hammer, head of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, has been reassigned. Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon, both career ICE officials, will replace them. The administration aims to increase arrests of migrants living in the U.S. illegally, with Stephen Miller pushing for a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day, and the agency portrayed the changes as a realignment to support its increasing operational tempo.</p>

          <p>Major USDA cuts have severely impacted food banks and school food programs in North Carolina, affecting the availability of local produce for students and aid for food banks. The Trump administration cut over $1 billion in annual funding to programs that support local food purchases for schools and food banks. This has led to financial strain for local growers, such as Pine Knot Farms, and reduced the capacity of food banks to provide assistance to those in need. The cuts are raising concerns about food insecurity and the ability to support vulnerable populations in the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will begin revoking visas for some Chinese international students, including those studying in "critical fields," according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The government will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from China and Hong Kong. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. has criticized the announcement, stating it is "firmly opposed to this politically motivated and discriminatory action." This move comes amid intensifying scrutiny of the ties between U.S. higher education and China, adding uncertainty for international students.</p>

          <p>A senior Hamas official told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group will reject the latest US proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. The White House said that Israel had "signed off" on US envoy Steve Witkoff's plan and was awaiting a formal response from Hamas. However, Hamas stated that the proposal did not satisfy core demands, including an end to the war, and that it would respond in due course. The Israeli government has not commented, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told hostages' families that he accepted Witkoff's plan, although the future remains uncertain.</p>
