          <p>President Trump stated that Russia has agreed to a deal to end the war in Ukraine, but Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is hindering progress by refusing to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, potentially prolonging the conflict. Trump emphasized his desire to end the war and save lives, noting the significant financial investment the U.S. has made. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt expressed Trump's frustration and impatience, indicating that Zelenskyy's stance is perceived as moving in the wrong direction. US media reports suggest the US peace proposal includes recognizing Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.</p>

          <p>The value of President Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, experienced a surge after an offer was made to the top 220 holders of the coin to attend an "intimate private dinner" with the president, however it only partially erased the meme coin's decline in value. The dinner is promoted as an opportunity to discuss the future of cryptocurrency with Trump, who has expressed intentions to make the U.S. a cryptocurrency capital. The offer has drawn criticism from lawmakers, with Senator Chris Murphy calling it "the most brazenly corrupt thing a President has ever done." (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International tourism to the United States is slumping, while Americans are increasingly traveling abroad, creating a significant imbalance in travel spending. Factors contributing to the decline in foreign visitors include trade tensions, detentions of visitors, Trump's rhetoric, and a strong U.S. dollar. Despite the drop in international tourism, American consumers' appetite for international trips is helping to offset the impact on some airlines. Wealthy and aging travelers are particularly driving the demand for international leisure travel.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to shutter USAID has led to significant job losses across the United States, impacting nearly 20,000 employees working for companies and organizations funded by the agency. These cuts are felt particularly hard by workers outside of Washington, D.C., who are facing job loss and limited resources. Many are struggling to find new employment in their respective states, leading some to exit the formal job market altogether. The vast majority of USAID employees will lose their jobs on either July 1 or Sept. 2.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders targeting universities, aiming to reshape higher-education institutions by cracking down on diversity and inclusion efforts. The orders address foreign gifts to universities and college accreditation, with the administration alleging that accreditors have relied on "woke ideology" rather than merit. Despite his condemnation of diversity and inclusion, Trump also signed an order establishing a White House initiative on historically black colleges and universities. The administration has been engaged in an all-out attack on US universities since the president took office in January, seeking to dramatically alter institutions he has claimed have been taken over by “Marxist maniacs and lunatics”.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations. Trump asserted that a deal to end the war is "very close" but that Zelenskyy's refusal to accept US terms will prolong the conflict. US Vice-President JD Vance outlined the US vision for a deal, suggesting a freeze on territorial lines close to their current positions, implying concessions from both sides. Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine after a brief lull over Easter, with reports of missile and drone strikes in several regions.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Trump's Claim Linking Tattoos to Gang Membership</h2>

          <p>Experts have cast doubt on President Trump's claim that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's finger tattoos prove his membership in the MS-13 gang. Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been cited by the Trump administration as an example of alleged MS-13 affiliation. Experts acknowledge that some tattoos can be associated with gangs, but they emphasize that markings alone are not reliable indicators of membership and that Abrego Garcia's tattoos do not appear to be suggestive of MS-13 membership.</p>
