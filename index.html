          <p>A New York court ruled that President Trump's blanket tariffs were illegal, but an appeals court allowed their collection pending further arguments.  This ruling has limited immediate impact on the US-UK trade deal, as it doesn't affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. The UK-US deal to reduce these tariffs is yet to be implemented. The ruling does affect other UK goods subject to Trump's tariffs, creating uncertainty. The White House plans to appeal the decision.</p>
