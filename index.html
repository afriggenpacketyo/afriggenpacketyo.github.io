          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey is sharing marriage advice from his new book, "Poems & Prayers," suggesting that a smaller bed can foster greater intimacy between partners. He explains that he and his wife, Camila Alves, switched from a king-size to a queen-size bed to eliminate the physical distance that had grown between them. McConaughey emphasizes that this change brought them closer, literally shoulder-to-shoulder, which he believes is beneficial for a marriage. The actor also discusses the importance of prioritizing the couple's relationship, even while raising children, to set a positive example for them.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece posits that the Trump administration is using the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a pretext to consolidate power and suppress dissent, similar to how the Nazis exploited the 1933 Reichstag fire. The author argues that just as Hitler used the fire to crush political opponents and suspend civil liberties, the current administration is blaming the entire political left to justify crackdowns on free speech and opposition groups. While acknowledging significant differences between Weimar Germany and the modern U.S., the article warns that the pattern of leveraging a violent act for political repression is a historically dangerous one for any democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the rapid spread of the erroneous belief among some progressives that Charlie Kirk's killer, Tyler Robinson, was a far-right extremist. It highlights how this narrative, which was later contradicted by charging documents indicating a left-leaning motive, serves as an example of universal cognitive biases and the impulse to fit events into ideologically convenient frames. The author argues that to maintain credibility as the "reality-based community," liberals must be as vigilant against their own comforting fictions as they are in pointing out those on the right. The piece calls for epistemic humility and a focus on factual refutations of the administration's broader political agenda.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a unique paradigm for understanding the U.S.-China dynamic, contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He argues that while China's focus on engineering has led to rapid infrastructure and manufacturing growth, it has also contributed to issues like youth unemployment by prioritizing national power over individual happiness. Wang suggests that the U.S., despite its own challenges, could learn from China's physical dynamism and ability to execute large-scale projects. The article explores whether these differing societal structures are destined for conflict or if they can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant cyberattack has disrupted check-in and baggage systems at several major European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin, leading to widespread delays and some cancellations. The attack targeted software called Muse, provided by Collins Aerospace, which allows multiple airlines to use shared airport infrastructure. As a result, affected airlines have been forced to revert to manual check-in processes, causing long queues and passenger frustration.

          <p>Estonia has formally requested Article 4 consultations with NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered its airspace without permission over the Gulf of Finland. The incursion, which Russia denies, prompted Italy, Finland, and Sweden to scramble their own jets in response. This incident marks the second time this month a NATO member has invoked Article 4 due to Russian actions, following a similar request from Poland. Estonian officials described the violation as part of a pattern of escalating provocations by Russia, raising concerns within the alliance about how to respond effectively without triggering a wider conflict.</p>

The "Green Idea House" produces more energy than it consumes through solar panels, eliminating utility bills and powering two electric cars. Key strategies included disconnecting from the gas line, using all-electric appliances, and incorporating passive design elements like strategic roof overhangs for natural heating and cooling. The project demonstrates that sustainable living is achievable with standard materials and technologies, though it requires significant research, planning, and persistence from the homeowner to execute successfully.</p>

          <p>Critics argue that President Trump is leveraging the tragic killing of activist Charlie Kirk to launch a campaign of retribution against his political adversaries, framing the incident as a product of "radical left" violence. The administration is reportedly considering designating some groups as domestic terrorists and has intensified rhetoric against the Democratic party, despite a lack of evidence linking them to the crime. This response is seen by some observers as a classic authoritarian tactic: using a violent event as a pretext to crack down on dissent, erode free speech, and consolidate power by targeting and delegitimizing the opposition.</p>

          <p>A wave of intense, youth-led protests against government corruption and unemployment has led to the resignation of Nepal's prime minister and the appointment of Sushila Karki, the nation's first female leader. The upheaval began after police opened fire on demonstrators, sparking widespread violence that resulted in over 70 deaths. The protests were fueled by a Gen Z-led social media campaign exposing the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children. Karki, a former chief justice known for her anti-corruption stance, was chosen as the interim prime minister, reflecting the protesters' demands for systemic change in the country's political leadership.</p>

          <p>Athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including British 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson, have complained about the logistical challenges posed by the main warm-up facility's location. The track at Yoyogi Park is a 15-minute bus ride from the main stadium, forcing competitors to begin their preparations nearly two hours before their events, which some find draining. World Athletics President Lord Coe acknowledged the situation is "not perfect," explaining that the track used during the Olympics was no longer available. Organizers state they have done their best to manage transport and that the arrangement applies equally to all athletes.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad dictatorship, but the process is far from a direct public vote. Due to the displacement of millions and a fragile infrastructure, the election will be indirect, with a Supreme Committee appointing local sub-committees that in turn select members of an "electoral college." This college will then vote for 121 members of the new People's Assembly. The process has drawn criticism for its complexity and the significant power it grants to interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa, who will directly appoint an additional 70 members to the assembly.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is set to implement a significant change in its media policy, requiring journalists to sign a pledge to continue their coverage of the Department of Defense. According to U.S. officials, this new rule will prohibit reporters from gathering any information, including unclassified material, that has not been officially authorized for release. Journalists who refuse to sign the pledge or violate its terms will have their press credentials revoked. This move would severely limit access to the headquarters of the U.S. government's largest department and raises serious concerns about press freedom and transparency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas, which are used to hire skilled foreign workers. The administration cited a need to prevent "abuse" of the program and encourage the hiring of American workers. The move has been met with concern from immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue the steep cost will price out small businesses and startups, harming U.S. competitiveness in sectors like technology. The order, which applies to new requests, requires companies to decide if a foreign worker's value justifies the significant annual payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A published letter to the editor pleads with President Donald Trump not to attend the upcoming memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona. The author argues that the president's presence will inevitably attract anti-Trump protestors, creating disruption and potentially violence. The letter suggests that this will detract from the somber occasion and steal the focus from Kirk's family and their grief. The writer concludes by stating that the event should be about honoring Charlie Kirk's memory, not about the president, and therefore urges him to stay in the White House.</p>

          <p>A young and rarely seen pygmy sperm whale has died off the coast of Honduras after ingesting a large plastic bag, highlighting the lethal impact of plastic pollution on marine life. Researchers found the distressed animal repeatedly beaching itself and discovered the 11-inch plastic bag blocking its digestive system during a necropsy. The death is particularly tragic as it marks one of the very few confirmed sightings of this elusive species in Honduras. The incident serves as a stark reminder that an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and over a million seabirds die each year from plastic ingestion or entanglement.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," delves into the concept of "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and extreme emotional swings. Bellamy explains that while this state is a natural part of early love, it can become a form of addiction if the object of affection is unavailable or unreliable, leading to anxiety and craving. To break the cycle of unhealthy limerence, he recommends strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

Following a sold-out concert in Istanbul, the public prosecutor's office launched an investigation into the group for "indecent and immoral acts," leading to the cancellation of their tour. This case is part of a broader pattern where female artists, including pop star Gulsen and diva Sezen Aksu, have been targeted for allegedly offending societal morals.

Leader Sir Ed Davey's frequent use of playful, attention-grabbing stunts, like bungee-jumping, helped raise the party's profile but now faces questions about whether it's time for a more serious approach. Polling suggests many voters, including some Lib Dem supporters, feel the antics make the party look less serious. The party's challenge is to build on its recent gains by defining a broader policy platform while deciding how to appeal to centrist voters in a political landscape increasingly shaped by populism.</p>

This position is complicated by Germany's historical responsibility for Israel's security, which it deems a matter of "reason of state."
