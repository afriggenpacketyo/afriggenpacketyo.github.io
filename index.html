          <p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen criticized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, asserting that his actions have created chaos at the Pentagon. Shaheen cited Hegseth's alleged sharing of classified information via the Signal app and staffing issues as evidence of his unsuitability for the role. She emphasized that his behavior sets a poor example for those serving under him, questioning his leadership abilities during a critical time. In response, a Pentagon spokesman defended Hegseth's performance, pointing to past administrations' failures, while Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker announced a bipartisan request for an expedited watchdog investigation into the Signal chat leak.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and their families gathered to remember the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp. The camp, liberated by British and Canadian troops in April 1945, was found to contain thousands of unburied corpses and tens of thousands of emaciated survivors. Accounts from survivors detailed the brutal conditions, including rampant disease, malnutrition, and daily deaths, including Dutch teenage diarist Anne Frank. The commemoration served as a reminder of the atrocities and the importance of remembering the victims.</p>

Julio Cesar Sanchez-Puentes and Luddis Norelia Sanchez-Garc√≠a, who fled Venezuela and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested based on alleged gang affiliations. The judge rebuked the government for declaring them "alien enemies" without substantial proof, highlighting the drastic consequences of such a designation.

          <p>A Drug Enforcement Administration operation in Colorado Springs resulted in the arrest of over 100 individuals allegedly in the United States unlawfully at an "underground nightclub." The operation, involving multiple federal and local law enforcement agencies, led to the seizure of firearms and drugs. Officials said those arrested were turned over to ICE for processing and potential deportation, and active-duty military personnel were also present, prompting an investigation. Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez emphasized that his department's involvement focused on criminal violations, while Mayor Yemi Mobolade condemned criminal activity and praised law enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating is declining as he nears 100 days in office, with recent polls indicating that a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the presidency. Surveys from Washington Post-ABC News, CNN, and NBC News show approval ratings ranging from 39% to 45%, the lowest for a newly elected president at this milestone in over seven decades. These ratings represent a notable shift from the beginning of Trump's term when his favorability saw an increase.</p>

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks off Costa Rica, initially believed to be pirate ships, have been identified as Danish slave ships, according to Denmark's National Museum. Investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes confirmed the identity of the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which wrecked in 1710. Marine archaeologists conducted underwater excavations, finding evidence that matched historical accounts, such as charred timbers from a fire. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but didn't abolish until 1847.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that President Trump's first 100 days in office have brought significant changes, but also growing concerns about tariffs and their impact on prices. While Trump maintains support from his base, more Americans believe he focuses too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices, affecting his economic approval ratings. The poll also highlights differing views on immigration and the economy, with Republicans expressing more satisfaction than Democrats and independents. Overall, the poll suggests a decline in Trump's approval rating and increasing frustration with the Democratic Party's response.</p>

Israel ended the ceasefire in March and has since conducted daily strikes, expanded a buffer zone, and encircled Rafah, controlling around 50% of the territory.

The article cites examples such as pardoning a donor, promoting Teslas on the White House driveway, and profiting from a cryptocurrency marketed with his likeness. The author suggests that Trump is pursuing personal enrichment, expanding presidential powers, and rewarding donors, surpassing the ethical transgressions of previous presidents.</p>

The poll reveals public disapproval of many of Trump's policies and widespread economic discontent, including recession fears. Despite this, Trump still outperforms Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems. The survey also highlights concerns about Trump's efforts to expand presidential powers and potential non-compliance with court orders.</p>

          <p>With stock and bond markets experiencing volatility, dividend stocks are becoming more attractive to investors seeking income and stability. While dividend stocks are always popular, their appeal is growing as a way to balance equity growth and yield. There are numerous exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividend stocks, including both index funds and actively managed options. Actively managed ETFs aim to identify higher-quality dividend payers that offer a better mix of capital appreciation and yield, potentially outperforming passive dividend funds in a volatile market.
