          <p>Racquel "Kelly" Smith, along with her boyfriend and a friend, received life imprisonment for kidnapping and trafficking her six-year-old daughter, Joshlin Smith, who disappeared in February 2024 near Cape Town. The sentencing followed a six-week trial filled with shocking allegations, with witnesses claiming Smith sold Joshlin to a traditional healer for her eyes and skin. Despite extensive searches, Joshlin remains missing, leaving her family broken and the community fractured. The judge emphasized the trio's lack of remorse and the devastating impact on the Middelpos community, while police vowed to continue searching for Joshlin across borders. </p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was awarded the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, Germany, for her role in maintaining European unity and resilience. The award recognizes her leadership during challenging times, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Von der Leyen's tenure hasn't been without controversy, as she faced criticism over transparency regarding text messages with Pfizer's CEO about vaccine procurement. She also faced scrutiny for awarding contracts without proper oversight during her time as Germany's defense minister, with some blaming her for inadequate improvements to the German military's readiness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled at least 350 medical research grants at Harvard Medical School, citing concerns over antisemitism on campus and DEI practices. This action affects research on critical areas such as tuberculosis, chemotherapy, Alzheimer's, and ALS, impacting numerous faculty members and researchers. Scientists at Harvard express worry that these cancellations will hinder scientific breakthroughs and harm patients who rely on their work.

          <p>A bill requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in Texas public school classrooms has been praised by 40 Days for Life President Shawn Carney as a step in the right direction. The bill, awaiting Governor Greg Abbott's signature, mandates that each classroom feature a legible copy of the Ten Commandments. Carney argues the commandments represent a foundational moral code and dismissed concerns about violating the First Amendment, referencing Moses in the U.S. Capitol. He frames the bill as a response to a secular mentality and hopes it will encourage greater moral formation nationwide.</p>

          <p>The "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) movement has expanded into Europe with events in Poland and Hungary, aiming to promote right-wing populism and conservative values. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Polish voters to elect a right-wing candidate, while CPAC will host an event in Budapest with Prime Minister Viktor Orban. However, this expansion occurs amid rising tensions between the U.S. and the EU, particularly regarding Trump's proposed tariffs, which threaten a costly trade war.

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, as part of a series of clemency actions. Hoover, who was serving multiple life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, will remain in state prison due to a separate 200-year sentence for murder. While Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, authorities allege he continued to lead the gang from prison. The commutation followed advocacy from figures like Kanye West and is part of a broader pattern of pardons issued by Trump during his term.</p>

The editorial outlines a potential deal where Russia retains control of territories in eastern and southern Ukraine, while the West lifts sanctions and commits to supporting Ukraine's economy and defense.

          <p>Ibram X. Kendi argues that the Trump administration is systematically attacking Black history by purging content, removing books, and cutting funding to historical institutions. Kendi draws parallels to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false reports of assaults fueled violence against Black Atlantans. He contends that the administration's framing of Black history as "D.E.I." is a pretext for protecting white Americans, similar to justifications used by the Ku Klux Klan. Kendi warns that erasing Black history hinders understanding of racial inequity and the contributions of Black individuals to American society.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns about the safety of the U.S. food supply due to significant budget cuts by the Trump administration to federal agencies responsible for monitoring it. These cuts have led to staff retirements, reduced inspections, and policy rollbacks, potentially increasing the risk of foodborne illness outbreaks. Former USDA inspector Paula Soldner notes that remaining inspectors must now visit twice as many facilities daily, raising questions about the thoroughness of inspections. Experts fear that these changes could weaken the nation's food safety surveillance system and leave consumers more vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has transitioned from a robust democracy to what some call an "electoral autocracy," yet Orban's rule has captured the imagination of many U.S. conservatives. Orban has reshaped the courts, financially starved independent press, and stifled civil society, while fostering a culture of corruption. The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering in Budapest symbolizes the cross-cultural cooperation and admiration between U.S. conservatives and Orban's government. Critics warn that Orban's playbook, which includes suspending civil service laws and weaponizing state budgets, could be replicated in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Recent actions by the Trump administration, including restrictions on semiconductor software sales and potential visa revocations for Chinese students, risk undermining the fragile trade truce between the U.S. and China. These measures have sparked anger and uncertainty in China, raising concerns about the future of trade talks. While some argue that targeting students may ultimately benefit China by encouraging talent to stay or return home, the moves are seen as a blow to families and authorities alike. Despite a court ruling against Trump's global tariffs, the overall situation remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is reaffirming his commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing in China, a strategy that has drawn criticism from the U.S. and other trade partners. During a recent visit to Henan province, Xi emphasized the importance of self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as the "backbone" of China's economy. This push could intensify trade tensions with the U.S., as the Trump administration seeks to address trade imbalances and reduce state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts suggest that China's commitment to manufacturing-led growth is unlikely to waver, despite U.S. pressure.</p>

Common complaints include issues with asbestos, electrical safety, pest control, and dampness. The ombudsman calls for a "transformative overhaul" of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and a "national tenant body" to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>
