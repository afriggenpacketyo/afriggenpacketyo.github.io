        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Democratic Party is considering a resolution to explore a mandatory retirement age for state and local elected officials, spurred by concerns over leaders remaining in power past their prime. The proposal, initiated by San Francisco Democrats, reflects broader anxieties about age and leadership, particularly after the struggles of Senator Dianne Feinstein and former President Joseph R. Biden. While some argue it's ageist and discriminatory, others believe it's necessary to make way for younger candidates and ensure effective governance. The resolution will be debated at the upcoming state convention, though its chances of becoming law are slim.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, the Daniel K. Inouye Telescope in Hawaii, has recorded a detailed image of a cluster of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope the VTF will help predict powerful solar storms that can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) said the image was taken during technical testing, but it demonstrates the instrument's potential. Researchers emphasize the importance of predicting these storms to mitigate damage to Earth's infrastructure.</p>

Since returning to the White House, Trump has increased CIA surveillance drone flights over Mexico, designated drug cartels as foreign terrorist groups, and amassed troops on the U.S.-Mexico border to combat unauthorized immigration and drug smuggling. Sheinbaum has attempted to appease Trump to avert potential tariffs, but also emphasized the need to protect Mexico's sovereignty amid rising nationalism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is suing Colorado and Denver, accusing them of impeding federal immigration actions through state and city laws that limit cooperation with immigration authorities. The lawsuit challenges policies that restrict officers from holding individuals solely on immigration detainers and prevent sharing information with federal agencies. The administration argues these laws create sanctuary cities that harbor criminals, while local officials maintain they foster trust with immigrant communities and ensure public safety. The lawsuit is similar to others filed against Illinois and Rochester, N.Y., as part of a broader effort to compel local law enforcement to assist with deportations.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist, Dr. Awais Aftab, discusses the complex aspects of antidepressant use, noting their transformative benefits for some patients while acknowledging the potential for sexual side effects, manic episodes, and severe withdrawal symptoms. He highlights the lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, leading many to seek advice in online communities. Aftab calls for more research and transparent discussion about the benefits and trade-offs of psychiatric medications to address patient concerns and avoid ceding the conversation to those who exploit suffering for personal gain.</p>

          <p>Mali's military junta is planning to extend its rule until 2030 without democratic elections, prompting condemnation from the opposition. General Assimi Goita, the current interim president, has gained support to be declared president until 2030, which would extend his term by five years. A national conference organized by the regime also proposed limiting the number of political parties and tightening conditions for founding new parties. Critics argue these actions undermine the constitution and attack the democracy obtained after the 1991 revolution.</p>

Even cars made in the U.S. often rely on foreign-made components, broadening the impact. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and create uncertainty for automakers.</p>
