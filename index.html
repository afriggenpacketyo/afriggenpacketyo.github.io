          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to halt the purchase of Russian oil in the near future. This development is part of a broader U.S. strategy to exert economic pressure on Russia amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Trump administration has previously imposed significant tariffs on Indian goods as leverage to discourage trade with Moscow. While Trump praised Modi, the move comes after a period of diplomatic tension over India's reliance on discounted Russian crude oil.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high, driven by the International Monetary Fund's upgraded growth forecast for the country to 0.9% for 2025. Investor confidence was further bolstered by optimistic remarks from the U.S. Treasury Secretary about the final stages of trade negotiations between the two nations. Major companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor saw significant share price increases, leading the gains in the market. This rally occurred despite broader global trade tensions that have recently kept investors on edge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, who had lived in the U.S. since he was four, has died after becoming sick while held in an immigration detention center in California. His family claims he was healthy before his detention and that his medical complaints of fever and a cough were not adequately addressed by facility staff. The man, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, was eventually hospitalized for surgery but died before the procedure. His death has intensified scrutiny over conditions in detention centers and the consequences of the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has released its final report on the 2023 Titan submersible incident, attributing the fatal implosion to faulty engineering. The investigation found that the vessel's carbon fiber hull had multiple anomalies and was not properly tested, leaving operator OceanGate unaware of its structural weaknesses. The report stated that the company's analysis of monitoring data was also flawed, failing to recognize damage from a previous dive. The tragedy, which killed all five people aboard, was described as preventable.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly confirmed that he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations within Venezuela. He cited the influx of drugs and the alleged release of prisoners from Venezuela into the U.S. as the primary reasons for this decision. The move is part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean aimed at combating drug trafficking, which has included airstrikes on suspected smuggling vessels. The Venezuelan government has condemned the action as "warmongering" and an attempt at regime change.</p>

          <p>A group of parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their lawsuit against the local public school district. The funds were required as a bond set by a federal judge to cover the district's potential legal fees. The lawsuit stems from the suspension of their sons, who were found responsible for sexual harassment after they objected to a transgender student using the boys' locker room. The parents are challenging the school's policy and the disciplinary action taken against their children.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted the man suspected of starting the Palisades Fire, which killed 12 people and devastated a Los Angeles neighborhood earlier this year. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, now faces three federal charges, including destruction of property by fire and arson, with a potential prison sentence of up to 45 years. Prosecutors allege Rinderknecht, an Uber driver at the time, ignited a brush fire that later flared up amid high winds. Authorities have not stated a motive but noted digital evidence of the suspect generating an image of a burning forest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa is already impacting the hiring of skilled foreign workers, particularly for small businesses and tech startups. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the steep cost is slowing the hiring process and shrinking the available talent pool for highly specialized roles, such as in artificial intelligence. While the policy is intended to prioritize American workers, some business leaders argue it hinders innovation by cutting off access to a global talent pipeline. Companies are now exploring alternatives like upskilling domestic workers and recruiting from U.S. universities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of six foreign nationals for making social media posts that celebrated the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individuals are from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, and Paraguay. This action is part of a broader administration crackdown on comments deemed to be inflammatory or supportive of violence against Americans. The move has raised legal questions about the government's power to revoke visas based on speech, an issue that legal experts say remains largely unsettled.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A housing association chief in the UK has proposed a plan to help the government close costly asylum hotels by moving applicants into social housing. The idea involves the government providing funds to councils and housing associations to purchase properties, which would then be added to the nation's social housing stock. This approach, the article suggests, could drastically cut the cost of housing an asylum seeker from £54,000 to £4,000 per year. The proposal has reportedly been discussed with government departments as a potential solution to the expensive and politically contentious use of hotels.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is imperative, especially as states like California begin to enact their own laws. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, Blackburn emphasized the need for a national standard to protect consumers and children online from the risks associated with AI and social media. She is focused on bills that would safeguard personal data from being used to train AI models and protect an individual's name, image, and likeness. The senator acknowledged that regulating the fast-advancing technology will require focusing on its end uses rather than specific systems.</p>

The lawsuit claims that internal documents from as early as the 1960s show J&J was aware its talcum powder contained asbestos-like fibers linked to cancers but failed to warn consumers. The claimants, many of whom have ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, are seeking damages that could reach hundreds of millions of pounds.

His final appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied just minutes before the execution was scheduled.
