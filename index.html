          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 07:30:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the differing shopping habits between Baby Boomers and younger generations like Gen Z, noting that older consumers still frequent department stores. It highlights that Boomers appreciate perks such as superior customer service, personal stylists, and more generous return policies, which are often overlooked by younger shoppers who grew up with online retail. While department stores have struggled against e-commerce, luxury-focused locations like Bloomingdale's continue to perform well, supported by wealthier, often older, clientele. The piece suggests that a generational gap in shopping philosophy and the rise of social media-driven commerce are key challenges for these traditional establishments.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, brokered with U.S. involvement, has officially commenced, paving the way for a phased peace plan. The initial stage involves the return of all remaining hostages from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners, alongside a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces. In support of these efforts, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and U.S. President Donald Trump will co-chair an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh. Israeli officials have confirmed preparations are complete to receive the hostages, with their families being notified that the process will begin on Monday.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has sealed its major border crossings with Afghanistan, Torkham and Chaman, after intense overnight firefights between the two nations' forces. Both sides have reported inflicting heavy casualties, with Pakistan claiming to have captured multiple Afghan border posts and the Taliban government in Kabul asserting it killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers. The conflict erupted after Pakistan conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, retaliating for attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which Islamabad accuses Kabul of harboring. The escalation has prompted warnings from security analysts about the potential for wider, irreparable damage to regional stability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino will take on the additional role of leading the Presidential Personnel Office. Scavino replaces Sergio Gor, who is set to become the U.S. Ambassador to India. In his new capacity, Scavino will oversee the selection and appointment for a vast number of government positions. This personnel change occurs amidst an ongoing government shutdown, during which the administration is in a political standoff with Democrats. The President also recently directed the War Secretary to ensure military service members receive their pay despite the funding lapse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is centered on a significant disagreement over extending enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Democrats are insisting on renewing the subsidies before the November 1 open enrollment period, while Republicans argue there is more time since they don't expire until December. The potential expiration of these credits could cause insurance premiums to double for many of the 24 million enrollees, a majority of whom reside in states won by President Trump in 2024.

          <p>The coast guards of China and the Philippines are trading accusations following another collision near Sandy Cay in the disputed Spratly Islands. Beijing's coast guard stated that a Philippine vessel dangerously approached a Chinese ship despite repeated warnings, causing a collision for which the Philippines is fully responsible. Chinese forces reported they took control measures and expelled the Philippine vessels in a professional and legal manner. This incident is the latest in a series of confrontations in the South China Sea, where both nations have overlapping territorial claims over strategic islands and waterways.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the Democratic establishment's attachment to traditional political etiquette and decorum is hindering its ability to effectively counter the norm-breaking tactics of the Trump administration. The author praises California Governor Gavin Newsom's unorthodox proposal to redraw congressional maps as a rare example of strategic disruption, arguing that such boldness is necessary in the current political climate. The piece suggests that elite liberal institutions prioritize agreeability and restraint, which dulls urgency and fails to resonate with voters. It concludes that strategically and non-violently breaking from convention may be essential for defending democratic institutions against authoritarian threats.</p>

          <p>Officials within the Trump administration are exploring the sale of portions of the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to private investors, a move that could significantly alter the student debt landscape. The discussions, involving senior members of the Education and Treasury departments, align with a broader goal of reducing federal involvement in the student loan system. Critics and borrower advocates express concern that such a sale could jeopardize existing borrower protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and the potential for loan forgiveness. The plan is seen by some as part of an ideological effort to diminish the role of the Department of Education.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has criticized President Donald Trump's threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, labeling it a "typical example of U.S. double standards." A spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry stated that China is prepared to implement its own countermeasures and is "not afraid" of a potential trade war. The U.S. threat came in response to Beijing's decision to tighten export controls on rare earths, materials critical for high-tech manufacturing. This sharp escalation in rhetoric has renewed fears of a full-blown trade conflict, rattling financial markets and casting doubt on a planned meeting between the two nations' leaders.</p>

          <p>This article details the financial implications of working while collecting Social Security benefits, particularly for those under full retirement age. While earning above certain thresholds ($23,400 or $62,160 in 2025, depending on proximity to retirement age) can lead to a temporary reduction in benefits, this is not a permanent loss. The Social Security Administration later recalculates and increases future monthly payments to compensate for the withheld amount. Furthermore, continuing to work can boost one's 35-year average wage calculation, potentially replacing lower-earning years with higher ones and permanently increasing the benefit amount.

Mainstream medical organizations consider the therapy, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, to be ineffective and dangerous.

          <p>Despite having access to elite coaching and facilities at their clubs, a growing number of top footballers, including Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes, are hiring private coaches for supplemental training. These coaches offer personalized sessions that focus on fine-tuning specific skills or scenarios that may not be addressed in a group setting. While players see it as a way to gain a competitive edge and build confidence, some club managers express concern about the risk of over-exertion and injury. The article notes that successful private coaching often relies on open communication and collaboration with the player's club to ensure the extra work complements their official training schedule.</p>

          <p>China is embarking on one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980-kilometer railway connecting the Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions. Dubbed a 'project of the century,' the line will traverse extreme terrain, including high-altitude mountain ranges and permafrost zones, with an average altitude above 4,500 meters. The total investment for the railway could reach 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the costliest rail lines ever built in the country. The project is strategically important for Beijing, aiming to enhance economic integration, resource transport, and national security in these remote and politically sensitive regions.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the disgraced former lead singer of the rock band Lostprophets, has died after being attacked in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for child sex offenses. West Yorkshire Police confirmed that two men, aged 25 and 43, have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the incident. Watkins, 48, was jailed in 2013 for numerous crimes, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby, in a case the sentencing judge described as plunging to "new depths of depravity." The attack occurs shortly after a prison inspection report highlighted a marked increase in violence at the facility.</p>

          <p>An influential military unit in Madagascar, known as CAPSAT, has announced it is now in control of the country's armed forces, escalating what President Andry Rajoelina has described as an illegal attempt to seize power. The move follows weeks of growing anti-government protests over corruption, the cost of living, and police brutality, which soldiers from the CAPSAT unit joined on Saturday. This same unit was instrumental in the 2009 mutiny that originally brought Rajoelina to power. The capital, Antananarivo, is tense as the presidency condemns the action and calls for the defense of the constitutional order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed doubling tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a measure aimed at protecting its domestic industry from global overproduction. While the EU blames Chinese dumping for its industry's struggles, the move is also seen as a strategic response to the 50% steel tariffs imposed by the U.S. earlier this year. By aligning its tariff levels with Washington's, Brussels may be attempting to create leverage for negotiations to reduce U.S. duties on European steel. However, the policy has raised concerns about rising protectionism and potential negative impacts on major exporters to the EU, like the UK and India.</p>

          <p>Car dealerships across China are experiencing a severe financial crisis, with many operating at huge losses and struggling to maintain positive cash flow. According to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), the industry's 14 largest participants saw a 10% sales slump in the first half of 2025, following an 18% decline in 2024. This downturn is attributed to an intense price war among manufacturers and increasing competition from direct-to-consumer e-commerce models. Industry associations are now urging banks and financial institutions to provide support to the approximately 30,000 dealers to help stabilize the struggling automobile distribution sector.

          <p>The European Union has started the phased introduction of its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track the entry and departure of non-EU citizens in the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces manual passport stamping, requires travelers from countries like the UK to register their fingerprints and a photo on their first use. This biometric data will then be valid for three years. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel long-term, there are concerns about potential delays during the initial registration process as it is gradually implemented at airports and border crossings through April 2026.</p>

          <p>Wales's Plaid Cymru party has endorsed a plan to formally prepare for Welsh independence, though its leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, clarified this would not occur within the first term of a potential Plaid-led government. At the party's conference, members supported establishing a 'standing commission' to engage the public on Wales's constitutional future and prepare a white paper detailing a path to independence. This strategy marks a shift from the party's previous commitment to hold a referendum within five years. The immediate focus will be on pursuing greater devolution, such as gaining control over justice and policing, as steps on the journey toward eventual independence.</p>

Alkhaled, who was attacked by men believed to be bodyguards for Syrian singer Al Shami, sustained facial injuries and a suspected concussion. Despite video evidence and Alkhaled's own research identifying a potential suspect, the investigation into the incident remains ongoing. The case initially drew widespread condemnation from media organizations and government officials, but the slow pace of the legal process has left the journalist seeking closure and accountability for the attack.</p>
