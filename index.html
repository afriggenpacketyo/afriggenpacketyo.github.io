          <p>A columnist reflects on their earlier prediction that Joe Biden's age and perceived frailty made him a weak candidate against Donald Trump, arguing the Democratic establishment ignored obvious warning signs seen by the public. The article criticizes the party's inner circle and political journalists for failing to challenge Biden's candidacy sooner, citing fears of losing access and underestimating Kamala Harris. It concludes by suggesting the Democrats have a pool of younger talent but must learn from their strategic failures to be effective in future elections.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season under new manager Ruben Amorim shows promising signs, with a more relaxed yet responsible team environment and new tactical approaches. Amorim has implemented changes like treating players as adults, adjusting training intensity, and using a flexible three-man defense system that shifts during play. However, the article cautions that these "green shoots" could be another false dawn, as the team's true progress will only be judged by their performance in the upcoming Premier League season, starting with a crucial match against Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 unionized Boeing workers in Missouri and Illinois have initiated a strike after rejecting a contract offer from the aerospace giant. The employees, members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, are responsible for building military aircraft like the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets. While the union stated the strike is about respect and dignity, Boeing expressed disappointment, highlighting its offer included 40% average wage growth. The walkout adds to the company's recent challenges, including safety issues and a costly strike by passenger plane workers last year.</p>

          <p>Democratic legislators in Texas have fled the state to prevent Republicans from achieving a quorum needed to pass a controversial new congressional map. The GOP's redistricting plan is seen by Democrats as a gerrymandered effort to secure more seats for their party, prompted by Donald Trump. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent lawmakers from their positions, while Democrats maintain their actions are necessary to protect the democratic process from what they call a "racist, gerrymandered map" and a power grab.</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 157 migrants, mostly from Ethiopia, has capsized off the coast of Yemen, resulting in the deaths of at least 68 people. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed the incident, which occurred in rough weather, noting that dozens remain missing with only 12 rescued so far. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, a path the IOM describes as one of the world's most perilous. Despite the risks, over 60,000 migrants have arrived in war-torn Yemen in 2024 alone.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD reported its first monthly delivery decline of the year, shipping 341,030 units in July, a drop from the previous month. This dip occurs amidst a fierce price war in China's EV market, which has also impacted other major players like Li Auto and Nio, who also saw delivery decreases. In contrast, competitors such as Xpeng, Xiaomi, and Leapmotor recorded monthly growth, indicating a significant reshaping of the competitive landscape. The intense competition has prompted warnings from Beijing policymakers to curb excessive price cutting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City's most significant summer signing may not be a player, but rather Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former assistant at Liverpool, who has joined as Pep Guardiola's new right-hand man. The article suggests this hiring signals a major tactical shift for City, moving away from pure positional play towards a more direct, high-intensity style that embraces transitions, similar to Klopp's philosophy. Recent player acquisitions like Rayan Cherki and Rayan Ait-Nouri, who excel at carrying the ball and attacking vertically, further support the theory that Guardiola is adapting to the evolving, faster-paced nature of modern football.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the real danger in the current "permacrisis" is not political drama but the risk of stagnation, where nothing fundamentally changes despite widespread public dissatisfaction. It observes that while mainstream parties like Labour in the UK and Democrats in the US are losing public trust, their established power and the electoral system prevent meaningful challenges from new movements. The piece suggests a permanent disconnect is forming between an impotent, entrenched political class and an increasingly fragmented and angry populace, leading to a volatile but miserable status quo.</p>

          <p>Germany's birth rate has fallen to a new low of 1.35 children per woman, sparking a debate about female self-determination, economic pressures, and societal values. While some celebrate the choice to be child-free, experts point to a "fertility gap," where people desire more children than they have, often due to economic instability and inadequate state support. Sociologists suggest that to reverse the trend, Germany must improve the reliability of childcare and the compatibility of work and family life, as a declining birth rate threatens long-term prosperity and social insurance systems.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech firms Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve profitability in 2025, a significant milestone for the country's biotechnology sector. According to analysts, Innovent's success is partly driven by strong sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which is expected to generate 1 billion yuan in its first six months. This development signals a maturation of China's biotech industry, showing that these companies can create value for patients and payers, reducing their reliance on investor funding for survival and growth.
