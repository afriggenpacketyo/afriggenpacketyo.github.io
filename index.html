          <p>Despite fluctuating US tariff policies, garment manufacturers in China and Vietnam are proceeding with their expansion plans. While President Trump suggested the US isn't interested in producing sneakers and T-shirts, businesses remain cautious given the volatility of US trade policies. These countries are navigating a 90-day tariff pause while attempting to secure a deal with Washington to prevent further duty increases.

High-net-worth individuals are concerned about tariffs and potential geopolitical instability, leading them to seek secure storage for their precious metals.

Rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on cold tolerance across generations through DNA methylation changes, supporting Lamarck's theory that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. This research revives the debate between Lamarckism and Darwinism, suggesting epigenetics may play a more significant role in evolution than previously thought. The findings indicate that environmental factors can induce heritable adaptations in crops, highlighting the potential for Lamarckism in evolutionary processes.</p>

          <p>The Monaco Grand Prix introduced a new rule requiring teams to use three sets of tires during the race, aiming to increase strategic options and create more jeopardy. While the rule change tested the strategy engineers' brainpower, it did not significantly alter the race's outcome. Some teams used strategic maneuvers that were uncomfortable for some drivers. The underlying issue remains the difficulty of overtaking at Monaco, a problem that has persisted for decades.</p>
