          <p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers convened in South Korea to address the implications of U.S. tariffs, with many countries seeking engagement with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The meeting occurred shortly before a 90-day pause on tariffs was set to expire in July, adding urgency to the discussions. President Trump had imposed tariffs on numerous countries, claiming they exploited the United States through trade surpluses, but later suspended them for negotiations. South Korea's trade minister noted the challenges of trade talks amid upcoming elections, while Mr. Greer also met with the vice chairman of HD Hyundai to discuss potential shipbuilding cooperation as part of a trade deal. The article highlights the economic uncertainty and trade frictions impacting the region, with APEC reducing its economic outlook due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A statewide transit strike commenced in New Jersey as 450 unionized locomotive engineers walked off their jobs due to a disagreement over pay.

          <p>Two officials fired by President Trump are challenging his authority to remove them from their positions at the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board. The case hinges on whether the president can fire board members of independent agencies without cause. Lower courts have sided with the officials, citing a 1935 Supreme Court decision, but the Trump administration argues it has the constitutional power to control the executive branch. The article explores the competing legal interpretations and potential implications for the independence of other government boards, including the Federal Reserve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's repeated denunciations of 'activist' judges align with a historical pattern of presidents criticizing the judiciary when disagreeing with court decisions. The term 'judicial activism,' coined in 1947, describes judges who rule based on personal policy views rather than legal interpretation. Criticism of judicial activism has come from across the political spectrum, with presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon also accusing courts of overreach. The article examines historical examples of presidential clashes with the judiciary and how the definition of judicial activism has evolved over time.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are grappling with the Trump administration's claim that illegal immigration constitutes an 'invasion,' a key legal argument for using wartime deportation powers. The White House has declared a Venezuelan criminal group, Tren de Aragua, a foreign terrorist organization and cited its actions as an 'invasion' to justify deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. However, judges are divided on whether this definition aligns with the law's original intent, with some citing historical precedent to argue that 'invasion' refers to military incursions. The article examines the legal challenges and competing interpretations of the Alien Enemies Act, which has been invoked only three times in American history during declared wars.</p>
