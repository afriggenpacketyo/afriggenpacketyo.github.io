          <p>Oil prices increased more than 4% following President Trump's threats against Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, demanding unconditional surrender. The U.S. crude oil contract for July delivery rose to $74.84 per barrel, and global benchmark Brent for August settled at $76.45. Trump warned of potential action if Iran continued missile attacks on civilians or American soldiers. The Pentagon also moved assets to the Middle East, increasing U.S. military capabilities for defensive positions, expanding Trump's options in the region. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would not call Minnesota Governor Tim Walz following the shootings of two state lawmakers, citing Walz as "slick" and "whacked out," claiming it would be a waste of time. This decision breaks from the tradition of presidents offering condolences during tragedies. Despite Trump's refusal, Vice President JD Vance contacted Walz, with the governor expressing appreciation for federal law enforcement coordination. Vance Boelter faces charges for the killings and wounding of the lawmakers and their spouses after a multi-agency manhunt, with authorities indicating that he planned to target other lawmakers as well. </p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company's corporate workforce will shrink in the coming years due to the adoption of generative artificial intelligence tools. He encouraged employees to learn how to use AI tools and experiment with smaller teams to achieve more. This directive follows layoffs of over 27,000 employees since 2022 and additional cuts this year in the North America stores and devices and services units. As of March, Amazon had 1.56 million full-time and part-time employees worldwide, in addition to temporary workers and contractors. </p>

          <p>According to a new Nielsen report, streaming services have surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable TV for the first time. In May, streaming accounted for 44.8% of total TV viewership, while broadcast and cable combined represented 44.2%. The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV, the rise of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies towards streaming-centric consumers. As traditional media companies transform into streaming-first entities, platforms like Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock complement linear TV, contributing to the ongoing shift in viewership habits. </p>

The move came after Trump threatened Iran's "unconditional surrender" and the White House denied reports of US involvement, though military assets have been moved to the Middle East. The resolution aims to ensure that Congress decides on matters of war, aligning with Trump's campaign promise to keep the US out of foreign conflicts. </p>

          <p>President Trump held a meeting with advisors in the Situation Room to discuss the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. The meeting followed Trump's early return from the G7 summit in Canada, citing tensions in the Middle East. Trump denied having contact with Iranian leaders regarding a ceasefire and dismissed an intelligence assessment that Iran was not developing nuclear weapons. He warned Iran against targeting US troops and assets in the region, promising a strong response. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales voted to decriminalize abortion, removing the threat of investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment for women who end their pregnancies. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill was led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, who emphasized that nearly 99% of abortions occur before 20 weeks, leaving only 1% of women in desperate circumstances. The new clause does not change any laws regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including time limits or the requirement for two doctors' approval. While the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children has criticized the move, abortion providers and MPs supported the amendment. </p>

While an agreement to reduce tariffs on UK car exports and eliminate them for the aerospace sector was reached, steel tariffs remain a point of contention. The Trump administration seeks assurances about when Tata Steel will switch on its new electric arc furnaces, ceasing the import of raw materials from abroad. The UK government hopes that the fact that Tata does not import any raw steel from China will persuade the Trump administration to include all British exports in the deal. </p>
