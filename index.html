          <p>Several Sunday newspapers previewed the UK's upcoming strategic defence review, highlighting potential investments in defence capabilities. The Sunday Telegraph reported a Â£1.5 billion investment in bomb factories and the acquisition of 7,000 long-range weapons. The Sunday Times indicated that British fighter jets would carry nuclear bombs as part of the "biggest defence expansion since the Cold War." Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need to restore war-fighting readiness, while Robert Jenrick called for arming prison officers to counter Islamist terrorists. The government is set to release its review on Monday to address the future of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.</p>

          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival, with revenue lower than previous holidays. The Hollywood film *Mission: Impossible â€“ The Final Reckoning* topped ticket presales, earning an estimated 54.6 million yuan on the first day, outperforming domestic animated features. This comes amidst broader economic challenges in China and a reported curb on American film imports. Overall box office revenue in China declined last year, highlighting the struggle to stimulate domestic consumption, though observers remain optimistic about the market's long-term resilience.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing about the sustainability of Hollywood's film and TV industry in California, with significant job losses following the 2023 strikes. Television production in Los Angeles has declined sharply, prompting calls for increased state tax incentives. Governor Newsom proposes more than doubling the state's film and TV tax credits to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries offering better financial incentives. However, some industry experts question whether these measures will be sufficient to offset the high cost of working in California.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that the UK government faces unavoidable tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for public services. The level of NHS spending will significantly impact potential cuts to other "unprotected" areas like transport and the criminal justice system. The government's commitment to not borrow more money or raise taxes adds to the pressure, leading to speculation about spending cuts. The IFS suggests the government's "front-loaded" spending approach means future funding increases will be limited.</p>
