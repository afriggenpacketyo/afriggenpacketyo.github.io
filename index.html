          <p>A new court filing suggests the National Guard's deployment in Washington, D.C., could extend through summer 2026, driven by preparations for America's 250th anniversary. This revelation emerges amid an ongoing lawsuit by the District of Columbia, which alleges that federal officials are exercising pervasive control over the Guard, transforming it into a federal military police force. The suit contends this federalization overrides local authority and violates the U.S. Constitution, despite some state officials not receiving extension requests. This complex legal battle highlights significant tensions over federal power and local governance, with implications for military and civil relations.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile eastward, marking the first such launch since President Lee Jae-myung took office in June. The projectile was launched towards the sea off North Korea's east coast, signaling continued military assertiveness. This event follows President Lee's campaign promises of halting hostile moves and his recent UN address advocating for peaceful coexistence and denuclearization efforts. However, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen numerous weapons tests since 2019, with recent suggestions of returning to talks only if Washington drops its demand for denuclearization, underscoring persistent regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A federal raid by ICE and DHS on Canal Street in New York City's Chinatown, targeting alleged counterfeit goods, led to violent protests and clashes with law enforcement. Protesters obstructed officers and assaulted a federal agent, resulting in arrests. City officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, distanced themselves from the operation, stating they do not cooperate on civil deportation matters and believe resources should focus on violent criminals. Public advocates and mayoral candidates criticized the "aggressive and reckless" military-style enforcement against immigrant street vendors, questioning its necessity for public safety and highlighting community fear.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Exports Rebound Overall, Though U.S. Shipments Decline, as New Prime Minister Takes Office</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 21:05:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year rise in September, ending a four-month decline, primarily driven by robust growth in Asia despite a significant 13.3% drop in shipments to the U.S. This overall rebound, largely fueled by semiconductor exports, coincided with Sanae Takaichi becoming Japan's first female prime minister. Her anticipated loose monetary policy and massive fiscal stimulus are expected to weaken the yen, benefiting exporters and contributing to the Nikkei's recent record highs. The article underscores the complex interplay of global trade dynamics, new political leadership, and economic strategies shaping Japan's financial outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew from his Senate hearing following allegations of offensive text messages, including a reported "Nazi streak" comment. This controversy generated significant bipartisan blowback, with multiple GOP senators indicating they would not support his confirmation. While Ingrassia's lawyer denied the authenticity of the texts or claimed satirical intent, the incident underscores the challenges in vetting political appointments and the scrutiny nominees face. The Office of Special Counsel, a critical federal watchdog for whistleblower complaints, remains without a Senate-confirmed leader due to this development.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner stated that the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan is progressing better than expected, despite recent violence between Israel and Hamas. Vance, currently in Israel, acknowledged "difficulties" in recovering all hostage remains, with two more bodies transported to Israel. The peace process has seen incremental steps, including the return of Palestinian bodies and the release of Israeli hostages, but the long-term viability of the plan remains uncertain. Critics, like former Israeli official Alon Pinkas, express skepticism about Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to lasting peace, fearing a resumption of hostilities.</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also had a call, but an in-person meeting is deemed unnecessary.

          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, emphasizing that healthy hair relies on simple, correct practices rather than expensive products or complicated routines. They clarify that cold water doesn't enhance shine, and no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which only a haircut can fix. Furthermore, the article stresses that hair cannot "self-clean," requiring regular washing to remove oil and debris, and dry shampoo should only be a temporary fix, not a substitute for proper washing. Prioritizing scalp health is key, similar to facial skincare.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial that he never witnessed his late teammate Tyler Skaggs use drugs, despite later realizing former communications director Eric Kay was allegedly supplying opioids. Trout, who loved Skaggs like a brother, did notice Kay acting "wired" and suspected drug use, but was unaware of the extent of Skaggs' drug involvement or Kay's alleged dealing. The lawsuit, filed by Skaggs' family, contends the Angels are responsible for Kay's access to players, while the team argues Skaggs' actions were personal.

          <p>A technical issue at Amazon Web Services' Northern Virginia facilities caused a widespread internet outage, affecting over 1,000 sites and services globally and costing companies hundreds of billions. This marks at least the third such incident in five years, highlighting the fragility and centralization of the modern internet's infrastructure, heavily reliant on a few massive companies like Amazon. The article explains how the "cloud" is a physical reality, and its consolidation creates single points of failure, impacting everything from payment systems to healthcare access. The incident underscores the immense power these digital landowners wield over daily life.</p>

          <p>Construction has begun on President Trump's new $250 million White House ballroom, but controversy surrounds the identities of its wealthy donors and corporations. Trump stated he would personally fund parts, with anonymous donors contributing over $20 million. Ethics experts, like former White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter, express concern, viewing the project as a "pay-to-play scheme" where donations could buy access to the administration. A pledge form suggested "recognition" for contributions, and a dinner for potential donors included executives from major tech and finance companies. YouTube has pledged $22 million as part of a lawsuit settlement.</p>

          <p>A significant new study by 22 public service media organizations, including DW and BBC, found that four commonly used AI assistants misrepresent news content 45% of the time. The evaluation of ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini, and Perplexity AI revealed 31% with serious sourcing problems and 20% with major factual errors, regardless of language. The study confirms that AI assistants systematically distort news, endangering public trust and potentially deterring democratic participation. Researchers are calling for governments and AI companies to enforce existing laws on information integrity and take more responsibility for how their products handle news.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's firm control over his administration, including his China hawks, could paradoxically act as a "guard rail" in US-China relations. Despite ongoing trade tensions and critical remarks from US officials, Trump has shown restraint in directly antagonizing Xi Jinping or challenging China's red lines like Taiwan. This dynamic elevates the importance of leader-to-leader diplomacy in shaping ties between the rival powers. The article posits that Trump's direct influence means he "calls the shots," potentially preventing further escalation despite structural competition between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Around 2,000 Waymo driverless taxis are under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after one vehicle reportedly drove around a stopped school bus with children disembarking. The incident, where the Waymo ignored the bus's extended stop arm and flashing red lights, raises concerns about the autonomous technology's compliance with school bus safety laws. While Waymo claims its vehicles improve road safety and has made software updates, this incident, along with others like an illegal U-turn, highlights ongoing glitches. California lawmakers are addressing enforcement loopholes as human drivers cannot be ticketed.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 17:32:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares fell approximately 7% after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily attributed to an unexpected 10% tax dispute with Brazilian authorities. Despite the miss, revenue rose 17% year-over-year, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and its best-ever ad sales quarter. The company adjusted its full-year operating margin forecast due to the tax matter but expects no material long-term impact. Netflix is expanding its content slate with major releases and extending the reach of its animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" through product partnerships and live experiences.
