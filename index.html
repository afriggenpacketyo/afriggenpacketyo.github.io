          <p>The Tokyo government is transforming a two-kilometer expressway in Ginza into an elevated green walkway, named the Tokyo Sky Corridor, expected to be completed by the 2040s. This project, modeled after New York City's High Line, aims to create a tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, and cafes. While the KK Line was toll-free thanks to rental income from tenants in buildings underneath the expressway, the redevelopment project faces challenges, including summer heat countermeasures and structural integrity concerns. The estimated cost is 14 billion yen ($97 million), potentially increasing due to rising raw material prices.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, prompting intervention from the Trump administration, particularly Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio. Concerns grew when Pakistani and Indian Air Forces engaged in dogfights, and explosions hit a key Pakistani air base near its nuclear command headquarters. Vance and Rubio contacted Prime Minister Modi and General Munir, respectively, urging de-escalation, leading to a cease-fire brokered with American involvement. While Pakistan acknowledged the U.S.'s role, India did not, and cross-border firing reports continued even after the announced cease-fire.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed "direct talks" with Ukraine, suggesting they begin promptly in Istanbul to achieve a lasting peace. This announcement followed a visit by European leaders to Kyiv, who urged Russia to accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire and threatened increased sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors. Putin stated he would discuss the details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but Kyiv has yet to respond to the invitation. The Kremlin has previously insisted that the West must cease military aid to Ukraine before any ceasefire can be considered.</p>

          <p>At a town hall in Pennsylvania, Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona called on the Democratic party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party, citing the need to include diverse voices and perspectives. Gallego used Joe Rogan as an example of someone the party "kicked out" because his message didn't completely align with the party's. He highlighted his own success in Arizona, a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, as evidence that Democrats can win by building alliances with those they may not fully agree with. Gallego also emphasized the importance of empathizing with voters and addressing their economic concerns.</p>

While opposition parties support a consumption tax cut ahead of the House of Councillors election, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative support measures for those in need. He also addressed tariff negotiations with the United States, stating Japan will continue seeking a complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports, but will not sacrifice farm products for cars.

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, a Maryland oral surgeon, has been convicted of depraved-heart murder in the overdose death of his girlfriend, Sarah Harris. The prosecution argued that Ryan, who had a history of providing Sarah with dangerous drugs like ketamine and propofol, recklessly disregarded her life. Evidence included text messages showing Ryan offering drugs to alleviate her anxiety and administering them while she was asleep. Despite the defense's attempt to portray Sarah as suicidal, the jury found Ryan guilty, and he was sentenced to 45 years in prison.</p>

          <p>As China aims to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its southwestern province of Yunnan is playing a crucial role in agricultural cooperation with ASEAN countries. Yunnan's involvement dates back to an alternative crop cultivation program aimed at reducing opium production by sharing agricultural technology. Given China's large demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could effectively support the country's food security. Rising living standards in China have shifted food consumption patterns, increasing demand for meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, aiming to achieve a durable peace and eliminate the root causes of the war. He suggested the talks could begin as early as May 15, but did not directly address a request by Ukraine and its Western allies for a 30-day ceasefire without preconditions. Putin's conditions for a ceasefire typically include a stop to NATO expansion and Ukraine's exclusion from the defense alliance, the removal of President Zelenskyy, and the return of Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the U.S.-Canada border are feeling the economic sting of President Trump's trade war, with border crossings declining significantly. Since the imposition of tariffs, Canadians are reducing travel to the U.S. and choosing to "Buy Canadian," impacting businesses in border towns like Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario. Duty-free shops are experiencing substantial sales decreases, and residents who frequently cross the border for various reasons are now reconsidering their trips. The economic impact is reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic, which previously disrupted border communities.</p>
