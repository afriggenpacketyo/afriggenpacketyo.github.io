This claim comes two days after Ukraine conducted an ambitious operation deep inside Russia, escalating tensions between the two nations. Meanwhile, Russia stated that no quick breakthroughs are expected in peace talks with Ukraine, despite both sides presenting their demands in Istanbul.

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has initiated legal action against Alina Habba, who previously served as President Trump's personal defense lawyer and currently holds the position of interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, accuses Habba of false arrest, malicious prosecution, and defamation, stemming from Baraka's arrest at an immigration detention center in Newark last month. Habba's office has since dropped the case against Baraka, citing a desire to move forward, but the mayor is still pursuing the matter in civil court, alleging the arrest was politically motivated. The lawsuit seeks damages for the harm caused to Baraka's reputation and career. </p>

This incident marks the second shooting by Israeli forces near the same aid site in southern Gaza within three days, raising concerns about a new Israeli and American-backed initiative. Witnesses claim civilians were fired upon by tanks, quadcopter drones, and helicopters near the al-Alam roundabout, about 1km (0.6 miles) from the aid site.

          <p>A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, is not effective in preventing travelers' diarrhea compared to a placebo. The study, involving 270 participants traveling to Southeast Asia, south central Asia, North Africa, or sub-Saharan Africa, found no significant difference in symptoms of loose stool or diarrhea between those who took Pepto Bismol preventatively and those who took a placebo. While bismuth subsalicylate is FDA-approved for treating diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and upset stomach, its off-label use for prevention, especially among international travelers, has been questioned by this new data. Further studies are needed to determine if there is a benefit in certain traveler groups or under specific circumstances.</p>

Khanna, representing Silicon Valley, emphasized that foreign students contribute significantly to the U.S. economy, citing examples like Elon Musk who was a foreign student. He noted that world-class educational opportunities for foreign students are a major U.S. export, and that many universities rely on international students to support employment and defray costs for American students. According to NAFSA, international students contributed roughly $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2023-2024 school year.</p>

          <p>An Illinois school district's board meeting was disrupted for the second time by opposing protesters amid escalating tensions over transgender athletes participating in girls' sports. The controversy arose after a junior high trans athlete won three girls' track and field events in May, leading to impassioned debates during the Naperville Community Unit District 203's board meeting. Pro-transgender speakers accused a conservative activist group of causing transgender youth suicides, while opponents vowed to protect girls' sports, citing federal law. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between state laws protecting transgender inclusion and calls for federal intervention, with one federal Title IX probe already underway in Illinois regarding transgender issues in schools.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply reduced its economic growth forecast for the United States, attributing the gloomy outlook in part to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The OECD now expects the U.S. economy to grow by 1.6% in 2025, a substantial decrease from the 2.2% forecast in March, with further slowing expected in 2026. This dampened outlook mirrors a broader global economic slowdown, with the OECD citing substantial barriers to trade and heightened policy uncertainty as contributing factors. The OECD also warned of a potential surge in U.S. consumer prices, potentially reaching 4% by the end of 2025 (not investment advice).</p>

Trump has been actively engaging with senators to garner support for the legislation, which extends his 2017 tax cuts and boosts spending for the military and border security while making cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs.

They criticize the bill for adding to the national deficit while failing to address key economic challenges, urging the Senate to reject the current proposal and start anew.

          <p>The fatal shooting of Sei-Jah Rivera by a California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer has ignited controversy due to the lack of body camera footage. Rivera, 21, was shot 12 times after a pursuit, but the absence of body-worn cameras on CHP officers in Southern California has hindered a clear understanding of the incident. While the CHP is in the process of deploying body cameras, the slow integration has drawn criticism, especially in light of the incident. The family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit, citing the CHP's failure to equip officers with body cameras and questioning the justification for the shooting.</p>

          <p>Ramon Morales-Reyes, the man publicly accused by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of writing threatening letters to President Donald Trump, was framed by another inmate, according to a court filing in Wisconsin. The inmate, Demetric Deshawn Scott, allegedly wanted Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying against him in an upcoming trial for robbery. Scott admitted to writing the letters and including Trump in the threat to ensure Secret Service involvement, while Morales-Reyes submitted a handwriting test that did not match the letters. The DHS stated that the investigation into the threat is ongoing, and Morales-Reyes will remain in custody due to his alleged illegal status in the United States.</p>
