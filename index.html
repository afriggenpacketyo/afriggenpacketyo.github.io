          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to third countries without providing them the opportunity to raise fears of torture, persecution, or death. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of "flagrantly unlawful conduct." The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security. The Trump administration has approached countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Rwanda to accept migrants and has an arrangement with El Salvador to detain Venezuelan migrants.</p>

          <p>The head of UNRWA condemned the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid organization, calling it a "death trap." This criticism follows reports from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health stating that 79 people were killed in Gaza, with 51 deaths near GHF sites. UNRWA's commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, stressed the need to reinstate humanitarian principles and allow experienced organizations like UNRWA to provide assistance with respect and dignity. GHF denies allegations of attacks near its distribution sites, while Israel and the U.S. claim the GHF system prevents Hamas from siphoning off aid.</p>

          <p>A provision in the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's second-term agenda would require the USPS to sell its new electric vehicle mail trucks. The bill aims to cut costs and focus USPS on delivering mail rather than environmental initiatives. Peter Pastre, USPS vice president, argues that selling the EVs would cripple the agency's ability to replace an aging fleet. While Republicans claim the provision could raise money, Pastre says replacing the vehicles would cost over $450 million, and the potential for raising money at auction is negligible.</p>

          <p>The conflict in the Middle East has caused many maritime insurance underwriters to avoid covering vessels with U.S., Israeli, or U.K. links. Insurance rates for vessels operating in the region have surged, with some underwriters declining coverage at any price. Concerns about Iran blocking ships and China's role as a major customer of Iranian oil influence the market. Experts suggest rates could ease if a ceasefire holds, but recent tensions between Iran and Israel are weighing on the outlook; rates have risen to as high as 0.5%, with even higher rates for U.S.-affiliated ships.</p>

Data shows a 1,271% increase in detained individuals without criminal records since before Trump's second term. Nearly a third of ICE arrestees have no criminal history, and the detention network is at its highest capacity ever. This surge follows a directive from Trump administration officials to increase arrests, leading to controversial raids and overcrowded detention facilities.

          <p>Recent arrests of elected officials protesting immigration policies are part of a broader campaign to step up deportations and intimidate dissenters. The Supreme Court's stance on Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971) limits the ability to sue federal officers for constitutional violations. Republican justices argue that Congress should explicitly authorize such suits. Critics argue that decisions like Egbert and HernÃ¡ndez embolden officers to violate the Constitution, particularly in immigration enforcement. This trend, combined with broad presidential immunity claims, raises concerns about accountability and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A major heatwave is intensifying across eastern North America, impacting over 160 million people and triggering health alerts. High humidity levels exacerbate the risk of heat-related illness, and temperatures are expected to remain high overnight. Heat warnings are in effect from the US Midwest to the East Coast, as well as parts of Canada. Experts advise caution due to the extended duration of the event and potential lack of nighttime relief, as temperatures in some eastern cities may remain above 80F (27C) overnight.</p>

A 2014 study linked high protein intake in under-65s to increased risks of cancer and mortality, while a more recent study highlights the importance of plant-based proteins for healthy aging.

A weakened Iran could strengthen a regional coalition of Arab states and Israel, reducing proliferation risks.
