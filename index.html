The diagnosis came after he reported urinary symptoms, with doctors finding a small nodule on his prostate. His cancer is a more aggressive form of the disease, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10, with metastasis to the bone. Biden and his family are said to be reviewing treatment options, and the cancer is hormone-sensitive, meaning it can likely be managed.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Mastermind: To Think Like a Killer," explores the story of Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric nursing professor who pioneered the profiling of serial killers for the FBI. Burgess began interviewing sexual assault victims in the 1960s and identified patterns of behavior that helped law enforcement understand the thinking of offenders. Her work led to insights into high-profile cases, and she is now working with her granddaughter to profile school shooters. Burgess also trains nurses to recognize signs of sexual assault in dementia care facilities.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe, with climate change intensifying droughts and reducing summer rain, leading to a predicted doubling of wildfire risk by 2100. The article highlights the link between climate change, land use, and urbanization in fueling these fires, with monocultures like pine and eucalyptus trees igniting quickly. Experts emphasize the importance of prevention through controlled burning, ecosystem restoration, and public education. They also call for quicker implementation of policies like the EU's Nature Restoration law and the sustainable management of forests.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China’s yuan could challenge the U.S. dollar as a global currency if Beijing increases convertibility and access for foreign investors. The economist notes the declining dominance of the U.S. dollar and the growing potential of the renminbi. To compete effectively, China needs to deepen its financial markets, allowing foreigners better access to yuan-denominated assets. He cited China’s existing “connect” schemes with Hong Kong as a potential model.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler won the US PGA Championship by five strokes, despite a challenge from Jon Rahm. Rahm's chances faded after missing birdie opportunities on the 14th and 15th holes, leading to a difficult finish. DeChambeau also contended but couldn't maintain momentum. English finished with the lowest round on Sunday, securing his best finish at a major. Rahm said the fact he got himself in the mix on the final day will do a lot to dispel the discussion about a drop-off in his results at majors since his switch to LIV at the end of 2023.</p>
