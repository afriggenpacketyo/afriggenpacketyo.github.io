          <p>Norway's colossal $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund is set to acquire a 95% stake in a prominent Manhattan office building for $542.6 million. The deal for the property at 1177 Avenue of the Americas is a joint venture with real estate firm Beacon Capital Partners. Managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the fund invests Norway's oil and gas revenues globally and already has significant holdings in New York real estate.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 08:44:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly exceeded the 5% threshold as markets reacted to growing uncertainty. Investors are weighing the implications of a federal court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's tariffs illegal, which could lead to substantial government refunds. Additional concerns stem from the president's efforts to dismiss a Federal Reserve governor, raising fears about the central bank's political independence and its ability to manage inflation effectively. These factors contributed to a cautious sentiment in the bond market ahead of the upcoming monthly jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At 45, Venus Williams continues to compete on the professional tennis tour, a striking contrast to her younger sister Serena's retirement. Following a quarter-final doubles loss at the US Open, this article reflects on her late-career stage, where the focus has shifted from winning Grand Slams to savoring her continued love for the game. Despite diminished power and struggles with an autoimmune disorder, Williams maintains her classic grace and a determination to play on her own terms. Her persistence serves as an inspiration, raising questions not of if she can win, but how much longer she can extend her legendary career.</p>

          <p>Relatives of the 346 people killed in two Boeing 737 Max crashes are making a final appeal to a federal judge to reject a non-prosecution agreement between the company and the Department of Justice. The families are demanding that Boeing face a criminal trial for allegedly deceiving regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the disasters. Prosecutors initially charged Boeing with conspiracy but have now moved to dismiss the charge in exchange for further fines and safety investments.

          <p>An exploration of art history reveals how the depiction of children has transformed over centuries, mirroring societal shifts in their roles and value. In early modern Europe, portraits of royal children were political tools for marriage alliances, presenting them as idealized assets. As the bourgeoisie rose, their children were also painted in opulent styles, often in mythological costumes to symbolize virtues. This article traces the evolution from depicting children as religious icons or miniature adults to later, more modern concepts of a carefree childhood, a phase that only became widely accepted in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

This optimistic outlook is based on an expected recovery in development margins and rental income growth, as well as a rich supply of completed homes in higher-tier cities. The forecast contrasts sharply with the weak interim results recently reported by the country's largest developers. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm reached hurricane strength with 75 mph winds but is expected to weaken back to a tropical storm by Friday. A tropical storm warning is in effect for parts of the peninsula, with forecasters warning that some areas could receive five to ten inches of rain. A second, stronger hurricane, Kiko, is also in the Pacific but poses no threat to land.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has recalled over 7 million vehicles in the U.S. so far in 2025, setting a new record for any full year and issuing more recalls than any other automaker. The latest recall affects over 355,000 trucks due to an instrument display panel issue that can be fixed with a software update. The staggering number of recalls has raised investor concerns about quality control and rising warranty costs, which have impacted the company's earnings. Management suggests the high numbers reflect a tightening of quality controls that will ultimately result in better vehicles for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of three UK parliamentarians is demanding an investigation into the case of 11 former Premier League players who lost tens of millions of pounds in investments. The players, including Danny Murphy and Brian Deane, allege they were victims of "financial abuse" after investing with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s, with some now facing large tax bills. The MPs argue the case represents a systemic failure of regulation and duty of care. A previous police investigation was closed in 2020 without charges due to insufficient evidence.</p>

The hosts are close associates of Douglas Wilson, a prominent pastor in the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC).

          <p>Contrary to a prevalent narrative that women are happier without spouses or children, a new nationally representative survey indicates that married mothers are the happiest demographic among American women aged 25 to 55. The study found 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to lower percentages for unmarried women and married women without children. These women also reported the highest levels of life purpose and meaning. The author suggests that while motherhood presents challenges like feeling overwhelmed, it provides a profound sense of purpose that contributes significantly to overall life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>A segment of the American right, led by influential figures like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens, is actively working to revise the historical understanding of World War II and Adolf Hitler. On popular podcasts and social media platforms, these influencers suggest the U.S. should have sided with Hitler, downplay his genocidal ambitions, and portray him as unfairly maligned. This article analyzes the trend as an attempt to transgress societal taboos and, more significantly, to reverse the post-Holocaust decline of antisemitism in America. By challenging the lessons of the war, they seek to mainstream conspiratorial prejudices that were once relegated to the fringe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the Democratic Party's strategy of forging an unconditional alliance with organized labor has failed to win back working-class voters and may even be counterproductive. While historically pro-labor, the party under President Biden adopted a policy of near-absolute deference to union demands, which can conflict with the broader public interest by raising the cost of living. The author suggests that policies like tariffs and make-work requirements, championed by unions, undermine affordability. The piece calls for a return to a more balanced, pre-Biden relationship with labor, where union demands are weighed against the public good.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football program is grappling with a significant decline in home game attendance, with the actual number of fans in the Rose Bowl often being far lower than the officially announced figures.

This trend is not new, as records show scan counts have sometimes been less than half the announced number.

Key factors cited for this optimism include the acquisition of star receiver Davante Adams, a strengthened offensive line with the return of center Coleman Shelton, and a formidable young defense. Combined with the coaching of Sean McVay and a relatively favorable schedule, the columnist contends the team has all the necessary components for a deep playoff run.</p>

The move comes amid escalating diplomatic tensions between Egypt and several Western nations over pro-Palestinian protests targeting Egyptian missions abroad. Egyptian officials have accused host governments of failing to provide adequate security for their embassies. The removal of the barriers in Cairo appears to be a reciprocal action following these disputes, including the recent brief detention of a pro-government Egyptian activist by British police in London.</p>

Drawing on political theorist E.E. Schattschneider, the author argues that by casting themselves as defenders of the status quo against a populist insurgency, Democrats have accepted a losing frame. Instead of commissioning more focus groups, the party should create new battle lines that can scramble existing coalitions, such as pitting "builders" against "extractors" like monopolists and private equity firms.
