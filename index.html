          <p>Israel's military announced it killed Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, in a targeted airstrike in Gaza City. The operation, a joint effort by the IDF and Shin Bet, was based on prior intelligence identifying his location in an apartment building. Hamas has not confirmed his death, while local reports indicate civilian casualties in the strike, a claim the IDF disputes by stating measures were taken to minimize harm. The event occurs as Israel plans a wider offensive into Gaza City, despite international warnings of catastrophic consequences for civilians.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 frigates to counter Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic. The agreement marks a significant win for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

This incident is part of a larger series of cyberattacks targeting companies through weaknesses in Salesforce-connected applications, with security researchers linking the campaign to the extortion group ShinyHunters.

          <p>A humanitarian aid flotilla, with climate activist Greta Thunberg and other prominent figures aboard, has set sail from Barcelona with the goal of breaking Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. The convoy, named the Global Sumud Flotilla, carries essential supplies like food and medicine for the territory, where the UN has warned of famine conditions. Organizers state the mission is to deliver aid and protest what they describe as Israel's violation of international law by preventing humanitarian access. This attempt follows previous flotillas that were intercepted by the Israeli military before reaching their destination.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the U.S. government from deporting 10 unaccompanied children back to Guatemala. The order, effective for 14 days, responds to a legal challenge by advocacy groups who argued the removals would violate U.S. laws protecting vulnerable minors. The lawsuit claims the administration planned to transfer the children to ICE custody for imminent deportation, potentially exposing them to abuse, persecution, or torture. This action follows a recent agreement between the U.S. and Guatemala that would permit such removals of unaccompanied children.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the first fatal case of whooping cough in the UK this year, involving an infant whose mother was not vaccinated during pregnancy. This death underscores government warnings about declining vaccination rates and rising vaccine hesitancy, with none of the main childhood vaccines reaching the 95% uptake target in England last year. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for protecting newborns in their first weeks of life before they can receive their own jabs. Of the 33 infant deaths from the illness since 2013, 27 involved unvaccinated mothers.</p>

Moore stated he has "no interest in fighting with the president" but will fight for his communities, inviting Trump to join a public safety walk to see the city's progress. Trump rejected the invitation, calling the city a "hellhole" and renewing his threat.

          <p>In an interview, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Céline Gounder warned that a recent exodus of top officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has created a dangerous leadership vacuum. She argued that key vaccine policies are now being determined by "political fiat" rather than a transparent scientific process, causing confusion for the public and medical providers. Gounder expressed concern that upcoming CDC meetings could see unprecedented reversals of long-standing recommendations for childhood vaccines, including those for Hepatitis B and measles. This turmoil follows the recent ouster of the agency's director and other senior staff.</p>

In contrast, Celtic's performance was notably feeble, failing to create significant chances and registering their first shot on target only after an hour of play.

A potential Trump presidency could see efforts to curb what they view as "woke" ideologies in academia, possibly impacting curriculum, funding, and institutional autonomy.

          <p>In response to widespread anti-government demonstrations, Indonesian political parties have agreed to scale back some state-funded perks for politicians, President Prabowo Subianto announced. The protests, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. The unrest escalated after a ride-sharing driver was killed by a police vehicle during a demonstration, inflaming tensions over police conduct. While some allowances will be reduced, protest leaders have indicated the concessions may not be enough to quell the dissent.</p>

Navarro labeled the ruling "weaponized partisan injustice" and echoed the president's sentiment that blocking the tariffs would be disastrous for the country. The court found that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the duties, though they will remain in effect pending a likely appeal to the Supreme Court.

          <p>CBS News is mourning the loss of veteran correspondent Mark Knoller, who is remembered as a legend in Washington journalism. For over three decades, Knoller served as the unofficial records keeper of the presidency, meticulously logging every trip, speech, and public comment made by multiple presidents. His encyclopedic knowledge and non-partisan approach earned him respect from both sides of the aisle, with White House staff often calling him for statistics. Colleagues recall him as a generous mentor and a dedicated reporter who was the "savant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave."</p>

          <p>Swimmers are being cautioned against entering the water at numerous beaches across the United States this Labor Day weekend due to high levels of fecal bacteria. Advisories have been posted from Florida to Maine and in California after water quality tests revealed contamination that could cause gastrointestinal illness, rashes, and nausea. A recent report from Environment America found that 61% of U.S. beaches tested experienced at least one day of potentially unsafe fecal contamination last year. The pollution is often attributed to sources like urban runoff and failing sewer systems.</p>

          <p>Major American retailers and food companies are warning that President Trump's tariffs are leading to higher prices on store shelves for consumers. Companies like Walmart, Target, J.M. Smucker, and Hormel Foods have indicated that increased costs on imported goods, from coffee to home goods, are beginning to be passed on. This pressure is occurring amid legal uncertainty, as a federal appeals court recently struck down most of the tariffs, a decision the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. The situation creates anxiety for businesses and consumers, particularly lower-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned reports that the Trump administration is planning to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential move an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been consulted on any such plan and argued that President Trump's motives extend beyond fighting crime, possibly to disrupt future elections. The president has recently criticized Chicago's leadership and suggested federal intervention is forthcoming, similar to deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The White House responded by attacking Pritzker's record on crime, escalating the feud.</p>

          <p>Two climate activists were arrested after smearing red and black paint on the iconic Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona. The protest, organized by the group Futuro Vegetal, was intended to highlight the Spanish government's perceived inaction on climate change, which they link to the devastating summer forest fires. The group claims the majority of wildfires are related to livestock farming and that the government is complicit in the environmental destruction. This act is the latest in a series of disruptive protests by the group, which has previously targeted famous artworks and private property to draw attention to their cause.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it") declaration, which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. A decade later, the nation is grappling with the complex legacy of this policy, which has profoundly reshaped German society and politics. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave were employed by 2022, challenges with integration and a surge in support for the far-right AfD party persist. The current chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has distanced himself from Merkel's approach.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the growing crisis of indoor heat-related deaths in Arizona, exemplified by the case of a 52-year-old man who died just two days after his home's air conditioning failed during a 115F heatwave. Despite his family's efforts with a window unit, the poorly insulated mobile home remained dangerously hot. This tragedy underscores a wider problem where low-income, elderly, and sick residents are most vulnerable, often unable to afford AC repairs or high electricity bills. As climate change intensifies heatwaves, experts warn these preventable deaths could surge, exacerbated by financial hardship.</p>
