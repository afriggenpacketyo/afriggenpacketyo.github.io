          <p>Paul Doyle appeared in Liverpool Magistrates' Court facing multiple charges, including wounding with intent and dangerous driving, after allegedly driving his car into a crowd following Liverpool FC's trophy parade. The incident injured 79 people, with a pram carrying a baby being struck, although the child was unharmed. Doyle, a former Royal Marine, only confirmed his birth date and age during the hearing and did not enter a plea. A fundraising campaign for the victims has raised over Â£30,000, including a significant donation from Jamie Carragher's charity foundation, and Doyle is scheduled to appear at Liverpool Crown Court for a subsequent hearing. </p>

          <p>Japan's government announced that China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which had been banned since August 2023 following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice to ease the ban and will soon open registration for Japanese facilities that process marine products. This move comes after Japan addressed concerns about the safety of its seafood following the controversial wastewater release. Other notable events include Japan and the U.S. holding tariff negotiations, Japan's parliament debating a dual surname bill, and North Korea allegedly providing Russia with ballistic missiles in violation of U.N. sanctions.</p>

          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, has responded to criticism regarding the scheduling of night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches. Mauresmo justified the choices by stating that women's matches can potentially be shorter, with only four women's matches being featured in the night sessions in the past four years. She also noted that the tournament avoids scheduling two matches in the night session to prevent late finishes, referencing the success of a recent match between Gael Monfils and Jack Draper that drew a full crowd. The French Open is attempting to balance promoting both men's and women's tennis while considering logistical constraints.</p>

West Java Governor Dedi Mulyadi stated that the company operating the mine was doing so illegally and had failed to implement necessary safety measures.

          <p>Harvard University's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security over a proposed ban on foreign students could potentially reach the Supreme Court, reigniting discussions about when justices should recuse themselves from cases. Four Supreme Court justices have ties to Harvard, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. While alumni status alone does not typically warrant recusal, deeper involvement with the university, such as Jackson's past service on the Harvard Board of Overseers, could influence the decision. The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration's visa restrictions are unconstitutional, adding further complexity to the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for governor of Virginia, is attempting to distance herself from her past hardline anti-abortion stance, as she declines to state whether she would support any restrictions on abortion access if elected. However, her record reveals a history of opposing abortion, including support for a 15-week ban and previous statements suggesting abortion should be illegal in most cases. This shift in tone comes as polls indicate Earle-Sears is trailing her Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, and as some GOP strategists suggest she is struggling to gain traction. The political climate in Virginia, where a majority of residents support abortion rights, may be influencing Earle-Sears's attempt to appeal to a broader electorate.</p>

          <p>New research has found PFAS "forever chemicals" in nearly all of 23 beers sampled across various brands and states, raising concerns about the safety of a popular beverage. The study correlated PFAS levels in the beer with the local water supply, suggesting that contaminated water is a primary source of the chemicals. While the study doesn't advise against drinking beer, it encourages brewers, consumers, and policymakers to make informed decisions about beer consumption and address potential risks. The levels detected were as high as 40 parts per trillion, exceeding some drinking water limits, particularly in regions with known PFAS contamination.</p>

          <p>Major American retail giants are reportedly pushing their Chinese suppliers to absorb 50% to 66% of the costs associated with US import duties, as the US-China trade war intensifies pressure on businesses' bottom lines.

Negotiations remain ongoing, with details of how tariff costs will be divided still being finalized, as both sides navigate a challenging economic environment. This shift indicates a growing effort by US retailers to mitigate the financial impact of tariffs by transferring the burden to their suppliers.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, is now questioning the standard model of cosmology. Riess's precise observations of galaxies have revealed a discrepancy in the expansion rate of the universe, known as the Hubble tension, which challenges the current understanding of dark energy. While some cosmologists remain skeptical, Riess believes that the Hubble tension could indicate a flaw in the standard model. New data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suggests that dark energy may be weakening, potentially requiring a revision of the standard model and altering our understanding of the universe's ultimate fate.</p>

Despite global economic uncertainties and trade policies, India's growth outlook remains robust, supported by improving consumer demand in rural areas.

          <p>Three significant wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing full containment after burning for several weeks, leading to the lifting of all evacuation orders on Memorial Day. Firefighters have made substantial progress since the fires began around May 12. However, large wildfires are also burning in Manitoba, Canada, causing air quality alerts in the Arrowhead region of Minnesota. As of Friday morning, the Minnesota fires cover approximately 30,000 acres, with investigations ongoing to determine the cause of the Jenkins Creek Fire. </p>

          <p>President Trump is set to visit Pittsburgh to celebrate a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a move that follows his previous opposition to the acquisition on national security grounds. Former President Joe Biden had blocked the sale, but Trump now supports the deal, claiming it will add $14 billion to the U.S. economy and create 70,000 jobs. Details of the agreement remain unclear, though it is suggested that U.S. Steel will maintain its headquarters in Pennsylvania and have an American CEO and a majority of U.S. board members. This deal has faced opposition from the United Steelworkers union, who fear potential job losses.</p>
