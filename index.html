        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant blow to his economic agenda. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unilateral power to impose sweeping duties. The Trump administration had invoked the act, declaring a national economic emergency to bypass congressional approval for the tariffs, citing foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States as justification. The White House has swiftly appealed the ruling, asserting that it is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed his departure from the White House following a public disagreement with President Trump over the president's tax bill. Musk criticized the bill in social media posts and interviews, stating it would increase the budget deficit and undermine his work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's time as a special government employee is ending, as he has reached the limit of 130 days of government service per year. This marks a significant shift for Musk, who had previously invested heavily in Trump's campaign and promoted far-right ideology online.</p>

The export restrictions are part of a broader review within the Commerce Department concerning exports of strategic goods to China.

Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who recently assumed his post, expressed disappointment at the comment, emphasizing efforts to release the rice effectively.

Despite this, the judge has not ordered Khalil's release, citing insufficient response to allegations that Khalil did not properly disclose personal details on his residency application.

          <p>Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill stated that two inmates, Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves, who were among 10 people who escaped from a New Orleans jail nearly two weeks ago, may be in other cities. Eight of the 10 escapees have been recaptured, with some found in Texas. Investigations into the jailbreak are ongoing, with at least 13 people arrested in connection with the escape. The state's top prosecutor cited factors including the court system, jail staffing, and infrastructure issues as contributing to the escape.</p>

          <p>Pedestrian deaths have surged 78% in the past 15 years, partly due to the increasing size and weight of vehicles like SUVs and trucks, which create larger blind zones and require longer braking distances. The average passenger vehicle has gained 1,000 pounds and eight inches in height over the past three decades. Automakers have begun repositioning front cameras lower to help drivers see pedestrians, but the popularity of large vehicles is not likely to change. Families are advocating for changes to technology and awareness to prevent further tragedies.</p>
