            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire after reports surfaced of a second instance where he allegedly shared sensitive military information via the Signal messaging app. This time, the chat included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, raising concerns about the handling of classified information. The messages reportedly contained details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, including flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets. Critics, including Senator Tammy Duckworth, have called for Hegseth's resignation, citing national security risks, and the Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine compliance with DoD policies.</p>

            <p>Prison officers in the UK are demanding that staff be equipped with electric stun guns to protect themselves while guarding the most dangerous prisons. This request comes after an incident at HMP Frankland where Hashem Abedi, one of the Manchester Arena bombers, attacked officers. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) is calling for the tactical use of tasers by specially trained staff to neutralize threats, as current equipment like extendable batons and incapacitant spray are sometimes insufficient. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has launched a full, independent review of the incident and suspended kitchen access for prisoners at the separation center.</p>

Paredes claims he and others were forced to sign documents stating they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU has submitted a document they say their clients at Bluebonnet received from immigration officials, titled "Notice and Warrant of Apprehension and Removal under the Alien Enemies Act," says, "You have been determined to be... a member of Tren de Aragua."

            <p>China has warned it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, amidst escalating trade tensions. This warning comes as the Trump administration reportedly plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. partners to limit dealings with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that China will not accept deals made at its expense and will take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry also cautioned about the risk to all countries if international trade devolves into a "law of the jungle."</p>

            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has kept its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision reflects the central bank's focus on stabilizing the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The PBOC's move comes after China reported better-than-expected economic data, including first-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%, providing room to maintain steady rates. The 1-year LPR influences corporate and household loans, while the 5-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates.</p>

            <p>This article reviews the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us," focusing on the shift in tone and storytelling compared to the first season. Season two deals with the consequences of Joel's actions in the first season, particularly his death at the hands of Abby. The show explores themes of violence, revenge, and the fracturing of relationships, but the reviewer argues that it leans too heavily into the characters' anguish, resulting in a more circular and suffocating narrative compared to the first season's exploration of building bonds in impossible circumstances.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The aircraft, painted in Xiamen livery, was waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery. Trump recently raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to impose a 125% tariff on US goods. The high tariffs make it financially unfeasible for the Chinese airline to take delivery of the new jet, which has a market value of around $55 million.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is threatening to cut another $1 billion in funding for Harvard University, this time targeting health research, according to the Wall Street Journal. This action follows the administration's withholding of government funding from Harvard and other universities due to their handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and allegations of antisemitism. The administration's plans to pull research funds arose after officials thought a list of demands they sent Harvard on April 11 was a confidential starting point for negotiations, and officials were surprised when Harvard released the letter to the public. The administration has also threatened to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status.</p>

One couple, Satsuki and Minato, entered such a marriage three years ago, driven by societal pressures and the desire for companionship without romantic or sexual involvement. A Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 friendship marriages in the past decade, often involving individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ seeking social security benefits and familial acceptance. While same-sex marriage remains unrecognized in Japan, these unions provide an alternative for those seeking partnership outside traditional norms.</p>

The author suggests that China is not eager to negotiate and recognizes that the U.S.'s strategic goal is to systematically strangle China's economic rise, not merely rebalance trade. To counter this, China needs to resolve its own economic weaknesses, primarily the fragmentation of its domestic market, and focus on innovation and technological self-reliance.</p>

The rollout of the "free hours" scheme, intended to transform the lives of thousands of women, has not been the panacea many had hoped. Parents report increasing difficulty finding nursery places, and experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those who are not. The system is heavily reliant on private nurseries, which are facing rising operating costs, and staffing remains a significant problem.</p>

            <p>US President Donald Trump expressed optimism that a deal between Russia and Ukraine could be reached within the week. Trump stated that both countries would then be able to engage in "big business" with the United States. Trump's statement comes after calling on Kyiv and Moscow to show willingness to compromise in the ongoing war. Despite Trump's hopeful outlook, a recent Easter ceasefire was broken by both sides, who accused each other of violating the truce.</p>

            <p>Men are less likely to seek medical help compared to women, often delaying visits until symptoms become severe, influenced by societal expectations of masculinity and self-reliance. An NHS survey reveals that many men feel pressured to "tough it out" and worry about appearing weak. This reluctance affects health outcomes, with men less likely to attend routine appointments or participate in screening programs. Experts suggest addressing appointment system limitations and tailoring services to better reflect how men communicate about health concerns.</p>

The court's order directs the Trump administration not to remove the detainees until further notice.
