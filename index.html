          <p>India's central bank surpassed market expectations by delivering a substantial 50-point rate cut, lowering the benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, its lowest level since August 2022. The move, marking a third consecutive rate cut since February, was prompted by softened inflation and slower-than-anticipated growth. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited a strong Indian economy amidst global challenges and uncertainty. The central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year, while maintaining its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. (not investment advice)</p>
