        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Line dancing is experiencing a significant modern resurgence, shedding its outdated image to become a widespread social media phenomenon, particularly on platforms like TikTok. Enthusiasts like 16-year-old Ava Stratford-Davies credit this renewed popularity to the mainstream appeal of country-pop artists and the adaptation of routines to diverse music genres beyond traditional country. The dance offers a unique blend of low-impact exercise and community building, attracting a younger demographic and breaking previous stereotypes associated with older participants. This article details how social media has been instrumental in expanding its reach and making it more accessible, fostering a vibrant and growing community that defies traditional perceptions and continues to evolve.</p>

          <h2>Rebecca Solnit Reflects on Historical Normalization of Sexual Exploitation, Linking it to Epstein and Feminism's Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 02:00:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rebecca Solnit argues that the pervasive culture of sexual exploitation of teenage girls by adult men, exemplified by Jeffrey Epstein, was once widely normalized across mainstream and counterculture in the 1970s and 80s. She cites numerous examples from films like Manhattan and Taxi Driver, the careers of child actors, and the origins of groups like NAMBLA, illustrating how such abuses were tacitly accepted. Solnit contends that the rise of feminism fundamentally challenged this deep-seated misogyny, insisting on active consent, women's rights, and rigorously exposing child abuse and sexual assault. This article underscores feminism's crucial role in denormalizing these long-standing societal abuses, despite the ongoing need for vigilance and further progress.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has achieved record-breaking pre-order sales in China, quickly surpassing last year's iPhone 16 series volume within minutes on major online platforms like JD.com. The standard iPhone 17 with 256GB storage emerged as the most popular variant, indicating robust consumer demand despite reports of customers experiencing difficulties accessing Apple's website and facing potential shipping delays for the iPhone Air. This significant sales surge underscores the enduring and strong appetite for Apple products within the competitive Chinese market, with some customers in regions like Guangzhou facing waiting periods extending to mid-October for their new devices.</p>

          <p>Bavaria's state minister, Hubert Aiwanger, affirmed the German state's continued openness to Chinese investment, even amidst growing economic tensions between the European Union and China. Aiwanger emphasized that while Europe needs to build greater economic resilience and self-sufficiency, protectionism and isolationism are not the appropriate solutions, extending this perspective to major economies including the USA and Japan. This article highlights Bavaria's distinct approach, aiming to maintain close economic relations and benefit from the many Chinese companies investing in the region, thereby reflecting a nuanced position within the broader European policy landscape regarding China.</p>

          <p>Questions are mounting over Sir Keir Starmer's initial defense of Lord Mandelson, as the BBC understands that No 10 and Foreign Office officials were aware of supportive emails between Mandelson and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein before Starmer's public comments. Mandelson, who was later sacked as UK ambassador to the US, had written to Epstein expressing support while he faced charges for soliciting sex from a minor, stating "Your friends stay with you and love you." This article highlights the significant political fallout, including pressure on Starmer and a Foreign Affairs Committee inquiry into Mandelson's vetting process, further revealing that Epstein had paid for Mandelson's travel on two separate occasions.</p>

          <p>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a prominent leader of the Belarusian opposition, alleges that dozens of political prisoners freed as part of a US-brokered deal were forcibly deported to Lithuania, rather than genuinely liberated. The release of 52 prisoners, in exchange for lifting sanctions on Belarus' national airline, was announced after White House special envoy John Coale met with authoritarian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko. This article highlights the opposition's concern that many prisoners were nearing the end of their terms and are now separated from their families without passports. Tsikhanouskaya calls on Western governments to demand that prisoners be allowed to remain in Belarus, questioning the true nature of their "freedom."</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers passed a GOP redistricting plan, explicitly backed by President Trump, which aims to create an additional Republican-leaning House seat by strategically splitting the Kansas City area. The plan, now awaiting Governor Mike Kehoe's signature, would shift the state's congressional delegation to seven Republican and one Democratic seat, contributing to a nationwide Republican effort to reshape maps. This article highlights the political implications, but notes the Missouri plan faces immediate legal challenges from groups like the ACLU, who argue it is unconstitutional, rushed, and designed to dilute minority voting power by splitting Black and white residents along stark racial lines.</p>
