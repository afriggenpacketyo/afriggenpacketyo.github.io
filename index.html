          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Kuala Lumpur during an ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting. This represents one of the most significant diplomatic engagements since the Trump administration's new term began. Discussions are expected to cover contentious issues such as trade tariffs, the status of Taiwan, and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting occurs amidst heightened tensions, with both nations navigating challenges like unilateral protectionism and seeking a more balanced international order.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to begin on August 1. In a public letter, the president cited Canada's alleged failure to curb fentanyl trafficking and its retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the new duties, threatening further increases if Canada responds in kind. This move marks a significant escalation in trade tensions with one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners and is part of a broader strategy of imposing higher tariffs on numerous countries. The announcement has raised concerns among economists about potential price increases for consumers and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists and analysts are closely awaiting China's first-half economic performance data to determine if additional fiscal stimulus is necessary to counteract pressures from U.S. trade policies. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% target, concerns persist about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and employment. Many experts argue that stronger government support is crucial to navigate the intense external challenges and achieve the full-year growth objectives. The debate highlights the growing uncertainty for China's economy as it grapples with the ongoing trade war with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is reaffirming the success of its recent military operation against Iran's nuclear program, stating the targeted facilities were "totally obliterated." This defense comes in response to a New York Times report, citing Israeli officials, which suggested some of Iran's enriched uranium may have survived the B-2 bomber raid. President Trump and defense officials have strongly criticized media outlets for questioning the mission's effectiveness, praising the skill and courage of the military personnel involved. The administration maintains that the operation has made the world significantly safer by neutralizing Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>A tense confrontation occurred in Ventura County, California, when U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters during an immigration-related warrant service at a marijuana facility. Federal agents deployed crowd-control measures, including what appeared to be tear gas and less-lethal rounds, resulting in several injuries. The standoff escalated when some protesters intercepted a convoy of federal vehicles, throwing rocks and causing damage. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom's office, condemned the raid, describing the tactics as inhumane and fear-inducing for hardworking communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a tentative ruling that would order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests as part of its mass deportation plan. The lawsuit, filed by civil rights groups, argues that federal agents have been unlawfully targeting brown-skinned individuals without probable cause, creating fear and harming the local community. During a hearing, the judge questioned the government's lack of specific evidence to justify its agents' actions and appeared unpersuaded by their general declarations.

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are operational again after being knocked down by high winds 14 months ago. Hundreds of onlookers gathered to watch the iconic blades start turning, an event celebrated with a can-can performance by 60 dancers and a rooftop fireworks display. The collapse in April 2024 was caused by a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed for the Olympics, a motor delay kept them stationary. The restoration returns a beloved symbol of Parisian nightlife to its full glory.</p>

          <p>Taeil, a former member of the popular K-Pop group NCT, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by a Seoul court after pleading guilty to sexual assault. The singer, whose full name is Moon Tae-il, was convicted along with two other men for the assault of an intoxicated woman in 2024. The court also ordered the men to complete a sexual violence treatment program. The singer's agency, SM Entertainment, had removed him from the group in 2024 after the criminal case came to light, citing the seriousness of the issue.</p>

          <p>A political strategist claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans by analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. The research identified eight words that consistently resonate with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. These words are described as "emotional shortcuts" that work across different cultures and political ideologies, from Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" to Labour's single-word "Change" campaign. The article also notes that the future of slogans may shift as AI allows for more personalized messaging to individual voters.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, the author of the cult novel "Trainspotting," is releasing a new sequel and has shared his concerns about modern society. He argues that the internet and AI are creating a "post-culture society" where machines think for us, leading to a "natural stupidity" in humans. Welsh fears we are becoming "dumbed down machines" and losing the ability to have real lives like those he nostalgically recalls from the 1990s. His new novel, "Men in Love," explores themes of love as an antidote to a world he sees as full of hate and poison.</p>

The author shares the story of a survivor who now lives in Australia and is triggered by reports of suffering from Gaza, highlighting a shared sense of human tragedy. The article questions the international community's repetitive cycle of witnessing atrocities, acting too late, and then declaring "never again."

Tesla recently began a pilot program in Austin, Texas, using Model Y vehicles with human safety supervisors on board, though the initial rollout has seen some documented incidents. The expansion into a new market signals Tesla's push to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space using its camera-based technology.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing an unusually warm 2025, with the warmest spring on record and the third heatwave of the year already underway in July. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these extreme heat events to human-influenced climate change, which has raised global temperatures by over 1.3°C. Analysis shows that modern heatwaves are hotter and more geographically widespread than historic events like the famous summer of 1976. Projections indicate that hot spells will become even more common in the future, particularly in southeastern England.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry even as it holds the record for the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility treatments has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with their assistance. Experts attribute this to a generational shift where people desire more control over family planning, often delaying childbirth for financial and career reasons. This trend offers a glimmer of hope for the nation's demographic crisis, contributing to a slight, first-in-nine-years increase in the birth rate.</p>

Meanwhile, the U.S. agency that designed the "bunker buster" bombs used in the attack is still awaiting data to confirm if the munitions reached their intended targets.

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a faster rate than the overall pace of global warming. This means that even small increases in the planet's average temperature can lead to significantly longer and more dangerous periods of extreme heat. The research, which analyzed global heat wave data, found that the longest and rarest heat waves are intensifying the most rapidly. This accelerated change underscores an urgent need for adaptation strategies to protect people, agriculture, and infrastructure from the growing risks.</p>

UNAIDS estimates that without these funds, there could be an additional six million new infections and four million AIDS-related deaths in the next four years.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a policy change that will exclude undocumented children from Head Start, the federal preschool program for low-income families. This move reverses decades of federal policy and is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for immigrants in the U.S. The change reclassifies Head Start and at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits," thereby restricting access for children without legal immigration status. Critics, including the National Head Start Association, warn the policy will create fear and confusion among all families in the program.</p>
