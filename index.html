            <p>Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church known for his humility and outreach, has died at the age of 88, as confirmed by the Vatican. He had been hospitalized for over five weeks due to a respiratory tract infection that later developed into bilateral pneumonia. Cardinal Kevin Farrell stated that Pope Francis dedicated his entire life to the service of the Lord and His Church, marking the end of a papacy defined by efforts to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and faiths, leaving behind a legacy of compassion and reform within the Catholic community. His death marks the end of an era for the Catholic Church. The Pope's death comes after several health issues in recent years.</p>

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC claims Uber misled users about the subscription's benefits, made cancellation difficult, and charged users without consent, violating the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act. Uber, however, denies these allegations, asserting that its sign-up and cancellation processes are clear and compliant with the law. The lawsuit marks the first FTC action against a major tech company since President Trump's second term began, highlighting the administration's focus on scrutinizing Big Tech companies.</p>

His comments come after his departure from Intel, where he led efforts to turn around the company and compete with Nvidia in the AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tech megacap companies are entering first-quarter earnings season amid uncertainty due to President Trump's tariff policies, impacting revenue and earnings for companies reliant on imports. The tariff situation changes daily, making it difficult for companies to plan for the future, affecting manufacturing, hiring, and marketing decisions. Analysts are concerned about the impact on ad spending and cloud businesses, with Piper Sandler pointing to fears of an 18% impact on growth forecasts for the 2025 global ad market. Companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia face challenges related to tariffs, supply chains, and consumer spending.</p>

Workers today are largely on their own when it comes to their retirement security, which has also taken a toll on retirement confidence.

            <p>The Trump-Vance inaugural committee raised a staggering $240 million for the second presidential inaugural of President Donald Trump, a new FEC filing shows, including millions from the cryptocurrency industry, cabinet members of the Trump administration and other corporate leaders. The record-breaking $240 million dwarfs the $107 million that Trump's first inaugural committee had raised in 2017. The filing only discloses donations and refunds, so it's not yet clear how much of that money was actually spent on inaugural events and how much of that money is left. The biggest donor was multinational food company Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, which gave $5 million despite having very little political contribution history at the federal level in recent years.

            <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services, such as diabetes screenings and HIV-prevention drugs, currently provided at no cost under the Affordable Care Act. The legal battle centers on how to classify the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations on preventive medical services. A federal appeals court found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed, leading to the Supreme Court hearing the case.</p>

The report comes as Musk's influence within the administration seems to be waning, with the New York Times reporting that the acting commissioner of the IRS was being replaced after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained about Musk's preferred candidate. Analyst Dan Ives suggests that Musk should refocus his efforts on Tesla, which he argues is facing a "code red" moment due to brand damage inflicted by Musk's political involvement.</p>

It adds to Boeing’s problems just as it was trying to recover from a mid-air door panel blowout in January 2024 that prompted the company to replace its chief executive.</p>
