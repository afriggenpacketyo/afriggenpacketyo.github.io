          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, potentially leading to further industrial action. The Royal College of Nursing has criticized the offer as inadequate, emphasizing that nursing staff have experienced over a decade of pay erosion. Professor Nicola Ranger highlighted that nurses are undervalued and receive some of the lowest pay awards despite being highly valued by the public. This vote is crucial in determining the next steps, including the possibility of a strike ballot, and casts a shadow over the government's upcoming 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team has filed a motion for a mistrial, alleging prosecutorial misconduct based on purportedly false testimony presented in federal court. The defense argues that Cassie Ventura's friend, Bryana Bongolan, provided inaccurate accounts of a 2016 balcony incident. Diddy's lawyers claim that the prosecution knowingly presented this false testimony, which could have influenced the jury's judgment. The motion also references previous requests for a mistrial related to fingerprint evidence and testimony about alleged incidents involving Kid Cudi.

While some veterans found the experience transformative, others, like TJ Duff, experienced a decline in mental health.

          <p>Navy veteran Michael Giardina participated in a psychedelic retreat in Mexico, organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, to address childhood trauma. During a psilocybin ceremony, Giardina experienced intense emotions and physical reactions, which he described as an "exorcism." He credited the intervention of a staff member for helping him "let go" of suppressed emotions related to his abusive father and his sister's suicide. Giardina's experience highlights the potential of psychedelics to help veterans confront and process deep-seated trauma, with the VA now conducting clinical trials to explore these therapies.</p>

The pager attack resulted in numerous casualties and created fear among Hezbollah militants, leading to a loss of command and control. The subsequent assassination of Hassan Nasrallah further crippled the organization, impacting its ability to operate effectively. This decline in Hezbollah's power, coupled with the fall of Syria's Bashar al-Assad, has undermined Iran's proxy war strategy and its ability to project influence in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. Her government began reimagining the country - not as a democracy rooted in checks and balances, but as a centralised state governed by command and control. Gandhi's top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system to centralise executive power, sideline an "obstructionist" judiciary and reduce parliament to a symbolic chorus. The idea never fully crystallised into a formal proposal but its shadow loomed over the Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralised executive authority.</p>
