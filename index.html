        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Counterpoint Research has significantly lowered its 2025 shipment growth forecasts for Apple and Samsung smartphones due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff policies. The research firm reduced its overall global smartphone shipment growth forecast from 4.2% to 1.9% year-on-year, citing renewed concerns over U.S. tariffs. Apple's shipment growth is now expected to be 2.5%, down from 4%, while Samsung is projected to see no growth, compared to a previously anticipated 1.7% increase. The revisions also factor in weakened demand in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, although Huawei is expected to see shipment growth due to easing component sourcing bottlenecks. Optimism about Apple's shipment growth has been tempered by concerns regarding tariffs on Chinese-made iPhones and Trump's desire for domestic production.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump admitted on his Truth Social platform that Chinese President Xi Jinping is "very tough" and "extremely hard to make a deal with," despite clarifying that he still "likes" the Chinese leader. This statement comes as Trump is expected to speak with Xi about ongoing tariff negotiations. Trump's administration has been engaged in simultaneous trade talks with various countries, with many having submitted their best trade deal offers. This follows Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods in response to China's retaliatory tariffs. Trump has also accused China of violating a preliminary trade agreement reached last month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a steep decline as investors expressed disappointment over Toyota Group's $33 billion deal to take the company private. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for shares of Toyota Industries at 16,300 yen apiece, lower than the previous closing price. This move occurs amid increasing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind cross-shareholding ties, a practice Toyota used to protect itself from acquisition threats. Analysts anticipate further unwinding of cross-shareholdings within the Toyota Group in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a reversal of changes to the winter fuel payment policy, ensuring more people will qualify for the allowance this year. The previous policy, which restricted the payment to those on pension credit, was widely criticized for negatively impacting pensioners with slightly higher incomes. While details on the exact changes remain unclear, the government aims to increase eligibility for the payment, worth up to Â£300, to help cover energy costs during the winter. The government insists the initial policy was necessary to stabilize public finances, allowing for the current improvements in the economic picture.</p>

The revamped Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a departure from the original version's grilled chicken and varied sauce options. The company launched a promotional webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, showcasing fan content and petitions that garnered nearly 19,000 signatures urging the wrap's return. McDonald's social media acknowledged the fans' role in resurrecting the menu item, emphasizing that customer demand ultimately drove the decision.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its potential to increase the U.S. budget deficit and burden Americans with debt. Musk, who recently left the Trump administration, expressed his disapproval on X, suggesting he might support challenges against politicians who supported the bill. The bill, which includes tax breaks and increased defense spending, has faced opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the bill, while Republican lawmakers indicated they intend to move forward despite Musk's criticism.</p>

The decision marks a significant step for Krenwinkel, now 77, after numerous parole hearings, with commissioners acknowledging her growth and concluding she poses no danger to society. Despite the recommendation, Krenwinkel's release is not guaranteed, as the governor has the authority to veto the decision.

While other states face challenges in implementing universal pre-K due to cost and potential impact on private child care facilities, Oklahoma's model offers lessons on how to balance public and private interests. The key is focusing on how to keep the child care industry afloat, develop an appropriate curriculum, and build enough facilities.</p>

          <p>England defender Millie Bright has withdrawn from selection for this summer's Euros, citing her inability to give 100% mentally or physically. The 31-year-old, who also withdrew from this month's Nations League squad due to burnout, expressed that she doesn't feel it's fair to take the place of another player who is ready to give everything. Bright was the captain when England was beaten by Spain in the 2023 World Cup final and was a regular in the 2022 Euros squad, where the Lionesses won the tournament.</p>
