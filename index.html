          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert known for his work on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000. Ojiri failed to disclose a series of high-value art sales to an individual suspected of financing Hezbollah, a proscribed group. This marks the first prosecution of its kind under the legislation, which requires individuals to notify the police if they suspect a business associate of involvement in financing a proscribed group. The alleged offenses occurred between October 2020 and December 2021, highlighting the importance of reporting suspicious financial activities to combat terrorism financing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite tariffs imposed on imported aluminum, the US aluminum sector is not experiencing a revival due to high electricity prices. The tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, but haven't spurred domestic smelting. Rising electricity costs in the US, relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures instead of restarts. Downstream users, like Thule Group, are raising prices due to increased raw material costs. The primary barrier to reviving smelters in the US remains the lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power, as energy costs for US smelters are significantly higher than those in Canada and other regions.</p>

Putin used the speech to link the war to today's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and said all of Russia was behind what he called the "special military operation". Xi's presence, along with Chinese troops marching in the parade, highlighted the strengthening ties between Russia and China, as Russia pivots eastward amid Western sanctions and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>

Car tariffs are cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while steel and aluminum tariffs are scrapped, but quotas will be imposed. Pharmaceuticals are still under negotiation, and the UK's digital services tax remains a sticking point.

Strategic theft, involving deceptive tactics to trick shippers, brokers, or carriers, is also on the rise. The widespread scheme is "low risk and a very high reward," and that crime costs the average consumer, too, as cargo theft fuels retail price increases.

          <p>Public health experts express concern over President Trump's cuts to federal funding for addiction treatment programs in Los Angeles County, despite recent declines in fatal opioid overdoses.

The author suggests that to end the politicized law enforcement, both sides of America‚Äôs political divide must come to accept a Cold War-era paradigm of mutually assured destruction.
