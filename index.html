          <p>President Trump celebrated the NATO allies' commitment to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, calling it "The Hague Defense Commitment" and a "monumental win" for the United States. Trump stated that this agreement would add over $1 trillion a year toward common defense, alleviating the financial burden on the United States. He framed this as a victory for Europe and Western civilization, emphasizing the importance of shared responsibility in defense spending. This commitment reflects Trump's long-standing push for NATO allies to contribute more to their own defense. </p>

          <p>President Trump refuted an early Pentagon report suggesting that joint U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities only set back the program by months, asserting that the facilities were "totally obliterated." Trump cited additional intelligence and reports from Israeli and Iranian sources to support his claim, emphasizing the severity of the damage. He dismissed the need for further negotiations with Iran, stating that the "war is done" and he does not foresee Iran resuming nuclear activities. The president also likened the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan during World War II, expressing optimism about future U.S.-Iran relations and noting Iran's agreement to a ceasefire. The article highlights the conflicting assessments and the political implications of the strikes. </p>

          <p>House Republicans, led by Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, are working to reinstate the National Coal Council, which was effectively disbanded during the Biden administration. Representatives Michael Rulli and Riley Moore are spearheading the effort to support the clean coal industry, citing energy security concerns amid Middle East instability. They argue that the Biden administration's actions against the council were a deliberate attempt to eliminate coal jobs and increase reliance on foreign energy. The revived council is intended to promote lower-emissions technology and support the increasing electricity demands of AI data centers, aligning with President Trump's focus on clean coal. </p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). Sales fell by 27.9% year-on-year, with Tesla's market share dropping from 1.8% to 1.2%. This decline is attributed to increasing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities.

The property, owned by the German federal government but run by the Russian federal agency Rossotrudnichestvo, incurs property taxes paid by Germany.

          <p>After decades of rhetoric and 12 days of strikes on Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming a "historic victory." Netanyahu, who has long advocated for attacking Iran's nuclear program, was previously deterred by the United States and his own security chiefs. However, recent shifts in the Middle East, including the weakening of threats from Hamas and Hezbollah, allowed Israel to take action. Despite a spat with President Trump over ceasefire violations, Netanyahu boasted about striking the Iranian regime, which helped him politically at home. </p>

          <p>A federal judge declined to place Los Angelesâ€™ homelessness programs into receivership, despite finding that the city failed to meet the terms of a settlement agreement. The judge, David O. Carter, stated that such a move should be a last resort, but found that the city breached the agreement by not providing a plan for creating 12,915 homeless beds by 2027 and by missing quarterly housing targets. To address these shortcomings, Carter ordered the selection of a third-party monitor to review the cityâ€™s data and signaled that he would likely order the city to pay legal fees. While the city avoided receivership, it faces increased scrutiny and oversight of its homelessness programs. </p>
