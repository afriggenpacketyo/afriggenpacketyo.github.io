          <p>Chevron reported a significant drop in second-quarter profits, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and a financial loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the overall decline, the company's adjusted earnings per share surpassed Wall Street expectations, and revenue also came in higher than anticipated. Chevron's global oil production saw a slight increase, with a notable jump in U.S. output, and the company anticipates the Hess acquisition will begin contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Vanguard emphasizes the critical role of emergency savings in safeguarding long-term retirement accounts like 401(k)s. The research found that individuals with at least $2,000 in a rainy-day fund are significantly less likely to take early withdrawals or loans from their retirement plans when faced with unexpected expenses. This cash buffer is particularly vital for hourly workers with volatile incomes, helping to prevent "leakage" from retirement funds and ultimately leading to greater financial security.

          <p>Rising global temperatures are profoundly transforming the sport of mountaineering, creating more hazardous conditions on the world's highest peaks. Melting snow and ice, which act as a natural adhesive for rocks, are leading to a significant increase in rockfalls and avalanches, making expeditions far more dangerous. This forces climbers to alter their schedules, often climbing at night to avoid the warmest parts of the day, and poses a long-term economic threat to mountain communities in regions like Pakistan and Nepal that depend on tourism.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain across the country on Monday. It is the fifth named storm of the season and is forecast to bring disruptive gusts of 60 to 80 mph, particularly in northern coastal and hilly areas. The storm's development is being fueled by an active jet stream in the Atlantic, prompting warnings of potential travel disruptions, damage to temporary structures, and possible power outages.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reforming its main civil service internship scheme to exclusively accept students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, a move aimed at increasing diversity and representation within Whitehall. The policy, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, will use parental occupation as the key metric for eligibility. Successful interns will be fast-tracked for the civil service's graduate program, the Fast Stream, in an effort to make the institution better reflect the country it serves, though the move has drawn criticism from conservatives.</p>

          <p>A historical review details the pervasive surveillance methods of East Germany's Ministry for State Security, known as the Stasi, which operated as the "shield and sword" of the ruling party. The Stasi employed up to 200,000 unofficial informants to spy on citizens, friends, and family, using tactics like wiretapping, mail interception, and spreading discrediting rumors to suppress dissent. This system of control, justified by the regime as protection against the West, created a climate of fear and suspicion that permeated every aspect of life in the German Democratic Republic.</p>

The initiative, known as the Rhisotope Project, is designed to make the horns easily detectable by customs and border security systems worldwide, thereby disrupting illegal smuggling networks. The researchers have confirmed that the process is harmless to the rhinos but provides a powerful tool to track and seize the horns, which are often trafficked to Asian markets.

He expresses concern over the administration's approach to NATO, Ukraine, and Iran, and discusses the broader decline in American leadership and values since the end of the Cold War, while still expressing long-term optimism in U.S. institutions.</p>

Despite a costly turnaround plan under a previous CEO, Intel's foundry business has reported substantial losses, leading to cost-cutting measures under its new leadership as it struggles to compete in the AI market.

          <p>A key railway line in Düsseldorf, Germany, has been targeted by a second arson attack in just two days, causing significant disruptions to train services. Police confirmed that the incendiary device used in the second incident was the same type as the one in the first, which was claimed by a left-wing extremist group. The attacks have damaged the line connecting Düsseldorf and Duisburg, affecting services including those to Düsseldorf's international airport. German rail operator Deutsche Bahn has condemned the acts as "vandalism."</p>

          <p>Police in Leicestershire, UK, have arrested a 76-year-old man on suspicion of administering a noxious substance after eight children and one adult became ill at a children's summer camp.

          <p>Federal prosecutors in New York now anticipate seeking a significantly longer prison sentence for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on prostitution-related charges. In a court filing, they argued against his request for release on $50 million bail, stating that the risk of him fleeing has increased as he could face a sentence "substantially higher" than the previously estimated four to five years. Combs was convicted of two counts of transportation for prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>A new provision in a recently passed tax bill will introduce a significant charitable deduction for the vast majority of U.S. tax filers who do not itemize. Beginning in 2026, non-itemizers will be able to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly for cash gifts made to charities. This change, similar to a smaller temporary measure during the pandemic, is expected to be a major benefit for millions of taxpayers and provides a new incentive for charitable giving.

While more than 145 countries already recognize Palestine, this move by two permanent UN Security Council members would deepen their split with allies Israel and the United States. The planned recognition is seen as a largely symbolic but diplomatically weighty measure to signal distress over the humanitarian crisis and to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution.</p>

A recent investigation highlighted deteriorating buildings with serious health and safety risks, but lawmakers only passed a fraction of the needed funds, most of which was then vetoed by the governor. The state's heavy reliance on declining oil revenue, without a statewide income or sales tax, has created a structural deficit that prevents funding for essential infrastructure like schools.</p>
