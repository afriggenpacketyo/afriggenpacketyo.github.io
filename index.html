          <p>Energy drink conglomerate Red Bull has completed a takeover of the Newcastle Falcons, a prominent English rugby union club. This marks Red Bull's first venture into the sport, adding to its extensive portfolio in football, motor racing, and winter sports. The club, which will be renamed the Newcastle Red Bulls, has struggled in recent seasons, finishing last in the Premiership for three consecutive years. The acquisition secures the team's long-term financial future and aims to enhance its competitive potential under the continued leadership of director of rugby Steve Diamond.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump's recent pledge to remove homeless encampments from Washington, D.C. has alarmed advocacy groups. Critics are concerned by the vague nature of the plan, which lacks specifics on where displaced individuals will go or what resources will be provided. Advocates argue that dismantling encampments without offering stable housing solutions is counterproductive, as it disconnects people from essential services and community support. They fear the policy may resemble punitive measures rather than a genuine effort to address the root causes of homelessness in the nation's capital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has indicated he may allow Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its most advanced AI chip, the Blackwell system, to China. Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested a deal could be possible if the chip's performance was reduced by 30% to 50%, and mentioned a planned meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. This potential policy shift follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of China sales revenue for export licenses. The move is seen by some analysts as a strategy to make China dependent on substandard American technology.</p>

          <p>Awdah Al Hathaleen, a 31-year-old Palestinian activist and documentary filmmaker, was shot and killed in his West Bank village of Umm al-Khair. The incident occurred during a confrontation with an Israeli settler, who was seen on video firing a handgun yet was released by police without charges. Hathaleen was known internationally for his peace activism and his work on the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," which chronicles his village's struggle against settler violence. The killing has heightened fears among Palestinians and drawn condolences from European diplomats, who call for community protection.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in job vacancies to 718,000 between May and July. This decline, concentrated in hospitality and retail, suggests some businesses are holding off on new hires or not replacing departing staff. Despite the slowdown, average wage growth remained at 5% and the unemployment rate was stable at 4.7%. Economists note the cooling is gradual, but the fall in vacancies is expected to contribute to slowing wage growth, a key factor for the Bank of England's interest rate decisions.

The meeting is presented as a significant geopolitical event where former President Trump's deal-making skills will be tested against a formidable adversary. The piece concludes that ensuring global stability now rests on Trump's ability to negotiate effectively, making his success a matter of international interest.</p>

          <p>The UFC has secured a seven-year, $7.7 billion media deal with Paramount, shifting away from its traditional pay-per-view model to broaden its audience. This strategic move comes amid questions about whether UFC President Dana White's close ties to Donald Trump could be a liability for the globally diverse sport. The article explores the complex political identity of the UFC's fanbase, which is not monolithically conservative, and notes that recent data shows declining pay-per-view buys. The new deal with Paramount, a company also facing political scrutiny, suggests the UFC is aiming to expand its reach as it navigates a shifting cultural and political landscape.</p>

          <p>Swiss sneaker company On Holding reported a 32% sales increase in its second quarter, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue forecast to 2.91 billion Swiss francs. This positive outlook comes despite the company facing new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, where it sources about 90% of its products. On offset the increased costs by raising prices, particularly on its lifestyle products, without seeing a slowdown in consumer demand. The brand, which has been gaining market share from competitors like Nike, saw strong growth across all regions, especially in China where sales grew by 50%.</p>

          <p>A controversial U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in Mobile Bay, Alabama, has united an unusual coalition of opponents. Commercial shrimpers, environmental groups, property owners, and Republican officials are fighting the practice of dumping dredged material back into the bay, arguing it harms the local ecosystem and seafood industry. While the Corps maintains that keeping the sediment in the system is beneficial long-term, critics demand the material be used for coastal restoration or taken offshore. The conflict highlights a deep divide between economic development priorities for the Port of Mobile and the preservation of local livelihoods and natural resources.</p>

It played a significant role in bridging the "digital divide" by using existing telephone lines, making it widely accessible. While largely replaced by broadband, a small percentage of households, particularly in rural areas, still relied on dial-up, and they will now need to find alternative ways to connect to the internet.</p>

Experts and residents express skepticism that aggressive police tactics can solve complex social issues like homelessness, mental illness, and addiction.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are being sued by a real estate developer and broker in Hawaii. The lawsuit alleges that after being brought in to endorse a $240 million luxury housing project, Ohtani and Balelo used their celebrity leverage to demand concessions and ultimately had the original partners fired from the deal. The plaintiffs claim the duo exploited their power for their own financial self-interest, causing the developers to lose millions in potential compensation. The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has suspended its search for a missing fisherman after a 40-foot vessel, the Das Bug, capsized in rough seas near the Yaquina Bay Jetty off the Oregon coast. The boat was carrying four crew members when it took on water in 7-foot swells and heavy winds. A Coast Guard crew rescued three individuals from the water, who were then treated for hypothermia. Despite an extensive eight-hour search covering 54 square miles, rescue teams were unable to locate the fourth crew member, leading to the difficult decision to suspend the operation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to reach the number one spot, specifically citing the ranking of his xAI's Grok chatbot. The threat follows Musk's celebration of Grok reaching the fifth spot among all free apps. This move escalates the ongoing feud between Musk and OpenAI, and adds to the antitrust scrutiny Apple already faces over its App Store practices.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned meeting between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, European Union leaders have issued a joint appeal. They are urging the U.S. to ensure any potential peace deal respects international law and includes Ukraine's involvement in deciding its own future. The appeal, signed by 26 of the 27 EU leaders, reflects widespread concern that a deal might be struck that forces Ukraine into territorial concessions. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, Ukraine reports having recaptured two more villages in the eastern Sumy region amid ongoing intense fighting.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their current trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the imposition of higher tariffs that were set to take effect. The pause keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the extension will provide more time for negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and addressing other economic and national security issues. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two economic giants have already been significantly impacted this year, with U.S. imports from China down 15% in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has reduced its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, its lowest point since April 2023, in a move to stimulate the economy. Concurrently, the central bank downgraded its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker public demand and a lower outlook for productivity. The RBA noted that inflation has dropped substantially from its 2022 peak, bringing demand and supply into better balance. While the risk of a major trade war has diminished, economic uncertainty remains a key factor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia have experienced their most severe bleaching event ever recorded, following a prolonged and intense marine heatwave. The damage spans 1,500 kilometers and has affected previously resilient areas, including the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef. The Australian Institute of Marine Science found that significant heat stress caused widespread coral to expel the vital algae that give them color and life. This event is part of a global bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures, underscoring the urgent threat that climate change poses to marine ecosystems worldwide.</p>

The woman, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, was told by her then-boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, that he had killed a man in a hit-and-run and buried the body. After he showed her the remote location, she dropped the can as a marker and alerted police.

          <p>Recent polling and protests in Israel indicate a growing majority of the public supports a deal with Hamas to release all remaining hostages, even if it means ending the war in Gaza. However, the same research reveals a stark disconnect regarding the humanitarian crisis, with 79% of Jewish Israelis reporting they are not troubled by the famine and suffering among Palestinians. This sentiment is attributed to a focus on their own national trauma and a media environment that reinforces a narrative of existential threat. This creates a complex public opinion landscape where the desire for peace and hostage return coexists with hardening attitudes toward Palestinians.</p>

According to interviews with escapees and intelligence officials, these workers are forced to work over 18 hours a day on construction sites with minimal safety equipment and little pay. Most of their earnings are sent directly to the North Korean state, a practice that violates UN sanctions. The North Korean authorities have reportedly tightened controls to prevent escapes, as Russia increasingly relies on this labor force amid its ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
