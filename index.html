        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned Hong Kong's latest offer of cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression," vowing to protect the rights and safety of those who have made the UK their home. The bounties are part of Beijing's ongoing crackdown under the national security law, targeting individuals accused of subversion following the 2019 protests. This action further strains diplomatic relations, with China dismissing the UK's criticism as interference in its internal affairs.</p>

          <p>Two 16-year-old youths have been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa on a public bus in south-east London. The court heard that the attackers, armed with machetes, cornered and fatally stabbed the schoolboy in a brief but brutal assault in front of other passengers. The judge described the killing as a "senseless loss" to knife crime, sentencing the teenagers to a minimum of 15 years and 10 months. The victim's mother delivered a poignant impact statement, mourning the loss of her son and questioning the violence that led to his death.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Explore Using Sharks as Mobile Ocean Sensors to Improve Hurricane Forecasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 23:20:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are exploring an innovative method for hurricane forecasting by equipping sharks with sensors to gather crucial ocean data. Researchers from the University of Delaware have tagged mako and white sharks to collect information on water temperature and conductivity, which are key factors in hurricane development. This approach aims to supplement traditional methods like satellites and robotic gliders, as sharks can cover vast areas of the ocean more efficiently. The data collected could eventually be integrated into hurricane computer models, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the conditions that fuel powerful storms.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking, was questioned for a day and a half by the U.S. Justice Department. The interview, conducted by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, covered a wide range of topics and individuals connected to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered all questions truthfully and that no offers of clemency were made for her cooperation. The development comes amid renewed attention on Epstein's associates and President Trump's past friendship with the deceased sex offender, though Trump has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the matter's significance.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Tunis to protest against what they describe as the increasingly authoritarian government of President Kais Saied. The march, held on the fourth anniversary of Saied's consolidation of power, featured chants calling for the "fall of the regime" and the release of political prisoners. Protesters argue that since dissolving parliament in 2021, Saied has dismantled democratic institutions, leading to mass arrests of opposition leaders, journalists, and activists. Critics contend that Tunisia has regressed into a state of fear, undermining the democratic progress made since the Arab Spring.</p>

Starmer stated the government would do everything possible to deliver aid via this route, calling the humanitarian situation a catastrophe that must end.

After a difficult start to the month, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games, providing some relief ahead of the trade deadline.

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. However, experts express concern that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year, as wetland habitats dry up and egg-laying is disrupted. While this year has been a visibly bumper one for many insects, the long-term trend still indicates a general decline in the UK's flying insect population.</p>

          <h2>Ghislaine Maxwell Granted Limited Immunity for Justice Department Interviews</h2>

          <p>Sources report that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of proffer immunity before her two-day interview with the Department of Justice. This legal protection allowed her to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche about the Jeffrey Epstein case without her statements being used against her. This type of immunity is common when prosecutors seek cooperation, though Maxwell has already been convicted and sentenced. Her attorney confirmed she answered all questions but stated no promises were made in return, even as her legal team hopes for potential relief from her 20-year sentence.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are celebrating the success of a mission to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which had been decimated by disease. After capturing and relocating dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated mountain range, conservationists have confirmed the animals are thriving. Recent observations revealed a growing herd, including newborn lambs, indicating the relocation was successful. The effort by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is a monumental step in rescuing the native species, whose numbers had fallen by 50% over the last five years.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with President Trump's special envoy announcing the U.S. team is returning home for consultations. The envoy blamed Hamas for the breakdown, stating the group's response showed a lack of desire to reach an agreement. This diplomatic failure occurs as the United Nations reports a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, with children starving to death due to severe malnutrition. U.N. agencies warn that aid deliveries are critically insufficient, with current food supplies at only a fraction of pre-war levels, leading to a surge in preventable diseases and deaths.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Question Unorthodox Nature of Ghislaine Maxwell's Justice Department Interview</h2>

          <p>Former federal prosecutors have described the direct questioning of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell by the Deputy Attorney General as highly unorthodox and concerning. Experts noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge, not high-ranking officials like Todd Blanche, who previously served as President Trump's personal lawyer. Critics suggest the move appears politically motivated to address public pressure regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files, rather than a standard investigative procedure. The situation raises questions about the credibility of any information obtained and breaks with long-standing Justice Department practices.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a rapid descent shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the dramatic maneuver, which was triggered by the plane's onboard traffic alert system. The other aircraft was identified as a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The Southwest flight continued to its destination and landed safely, but the incident has prompted an investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration amid growing concerns over aviation safety and near-misses.</p>

          <p>A recent article explores the scientific basis for popular health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and taking 10,000 steps a day. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks provide useful guidance, there is often room for individual variation and that strict adherence is not always necessary. For instance, some specialists argue that thirst is a reliable indicator for hydration, while others maintain a target is beneficial. The consensus among experts is that a balanced, consistent approach to health is more important than rigidly fixating on specific numbers for diet, exercise, and mental wellness.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying topics that were once ignored, such as how breast biomechanics impact running performance and how the menstrual cycle can affect training and competition. This new focus on female-specific physiology is leading to better support, from properly fitted sports bras to strategies for managing period-related symptoms. The shift marks a significant departure from the past, when female athletes were often treated as "mini-men," and aims to improve performance, reduce injury risk, and keep more women engaged in sports.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the food boxes being distributed in Gaza by the Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns among nutrition experts. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, lentils, and flour, provide sufficient calories for survival, they are reportedly deficient in essential vitamins and minerals. Experts warn that a prolonged diet of these items could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy. The aid also requires clean water and fuel for cooking, both of which are critically scarce in Gaza, compounding the challenges for a population facing a severe starvation crisis.</p>

While his exit was partly due to a major surgery and the Dodgers' pursuit of other pitchers, he expressed gratitude for his time with the organization.

The president's visit mixes business with diplomacy, as he will open a new golf course and also meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss trade. Trump's remarks on immigration and his criticism of wind power have been met with planned protests in a country where he is generally unpopular.</p>
