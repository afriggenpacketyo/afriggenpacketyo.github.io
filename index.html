          <p>The UK and European Union have reached a deal to reset relations after Britain's exit from the bloc in 2020, focusing on security, trade, and youth mobility. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. A 'balanced youth experience' scheme will enable young people from the UK and EU to work, study, volunteer, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time. The UK and EU will also deepen cooperation on irregular migration and explore the potential use of e-gates by UK passport holders in European airports. This deal aims to strengthen ties amid unpredictable global dynamics and a shift towards U.S. isolationism.</p>

          <p>Iran summoned the British charge d'affaires to its foreign ministry in Tehran to protest the arrest of several Iranian nationals in Britain, who were arrested on charges related to terrorism and spying. British police held seven Iranians earlier this month in two separate operations; three men appeared in a London court on Saturday after being charged with engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service, that being Iran in their case. Iran's state media quoted a foreign ministry official alleging that the arrests appeared to be led by "political motives" to "exert pressure" on the influential Middle Eastern nation. The UK government has placed Iran on the highest tier of its foreign influence register, requiring the Islamic Republic to register everything it does to exert political influence in Britain.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a new deal, bringing relief to commuters who rely on the system to travel to New York City and Philadelphia. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced that train service will resume on Tuesday, May 20, after a three-day strike. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, involves concessions related to work rules to fund the wage increases requested by the union. The agency needs about 24 hours to preposition equipment and conduct safety checks on hundreds of trains and miles of rail lines before resuming full service.</p>

          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union gathered in London to announce a freshly struck deal meant to tighten their trade and defense relationships, signaling a pivot toward a post-Brexit future.

Officials unveiled a defense and security partnership, outlining future military cooperation, and agreed to extend access to fishing waters. Tensions had emerged over a youth mobility program, with Europe pushing for lower tuition for E.U. students who study at U.K. universities.</p>

          <p>Tanzania's main opposition leader, Tundu Lissu, appeared in court for a treason trial, facing a potential death penalty, after launching a campaign for electoral reforms ahead of the October elections.

Human rights activists have accused Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government of heavy-handed tactics against the opposition.

          <p>Moody’s Ratings removed the final major Triple-A credit rating for the U.S. federal government, citing successive bipartisan failures to reverse the growing budget deficit. The downgrade reflects concerns about America’s spending and debt situation, with the deficit potentially increasing to 9% of GDP within the coming decade. Investors are questioning their exposure to U.S. financial assets, and politicians are more willing to offer spending or tax cuts than address the underlying problem. This could lead to higher interest rates, slowing economic growth and worsening the budget math. The article warns that the potential for a sudden financial crisis is increasing.</p>

By entering into these agreements, the firms have become subsidiaries of the administration, potentially facing long-term consequences. The author suggests that these law firms are naive to the power dynamics at play and are now subject to the whims of the Trump administration. The firms that chose to challenge the constitutionality of the orders against them are the only ones who have not been humiliated.</p>

Staff claim that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently completely handcuffed from working, as the Trump administration pushes to fire the vast majority of its workforce. The administration tried to axe about 1,500 of the CFPB’s 1,700 workers last month, only for his plan to be blocked by a federal judge. Workers also criticized the actions of the so-called “department of government efficiency” at the agency, noting the CFPB is funded by the Federal Reserve, and has returned over $21bn directly to Americans.</p>

A new trial found that vegan and omnivore diets offer the same muscle-building potential, provided that enough plant-based protein is consumed. While animal protein may be of higher quality on a gram-for-gram basis, the differences are negligible in the context of a balanced meal. Researchers emphasize the importance of adequate protein intake and resistance training for maximizing muscle gains.</p>

          <h2>The Challenges of Switching to Natural Food Dyes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's effort to eliminate synthetic dyes from the food supply faces challenges, as manufacturers grapple with finding suitable all-natural substitutes. While FDA commissioner Marty Makary suggests natural alternatives like watermelon or beet juice, companies like Oliveria Peppers have found the switch can be complex. Factors such as color stability, sourcing, and cost pose difficulties for larger companies reliant on dyes like Red No. 40 or Blue No. 1. Consumers may also resist changes in color, as they often "eat with their eyes."</p>

          <p>The horse racing industry is bracing for a potential crackdown on illegal immigration, which could significantly impact its workforce. The industry relies heavily on immigrant labor, particularly for the backside operations. While immigration enforcement largely left the industry untouched during Trump's first term, industry leaders are unsure if they will be able to avoid a larger crackdown this time. This has created stress among immigrant workers, with some trainers reporting that reliable workers are not coming to work.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Beijing may be less likely to enact aggressive fiscal stimulus measures in the coming quarter, as April's macroeconomic data has proven China's economic resilience against US tariff headwinds. Major investment banks have already raised their growth outlook for the world's second-largest economy. China's industrial output grew by 6.1 per cent from a year earlier in April, marking a slight deceleration from 6.5 per cent recorded in the first quarter. China’s retail sales increased by 5.1 per cent during the same period, up from 4.6 per cent in the first quarter, while overall fixed-asset investment rose by 4 per cent in the first four months of 2025.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a "small nodule" on his prostate. The cancer is Stage 4, which means it has spread. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.</p>
