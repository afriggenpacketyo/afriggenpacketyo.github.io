          <h2>Live Aid's 40th Anniversary Prompts Reflection on Its Legacy and Controversies</h2>

          <p>Marking 40 years since the monumental Live Aid concerts, reflections on the event highlight its unprecedented global reach and fundraising success for Ethiopian famine relief. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the 1985 broadcast united billions and set a template for future benefit concerts. However, the anniversary also brings renewed scrutiny over its flaws, particularly the lack of African performers and female artists in a lineup that was overwhelmingly white and male. Critics argue it reinforced a patronizing image of Africa, a charge Geldof dismisses, while supporters point to its long-term impact on debt relief and charitable initiatives.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney General has ordered the dismissal of all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore Jr., a Utah plastic surgeon accused of destroying thousands of dollars worth of COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. Moore was also indicted for allegedly providing fake vaccination cards and administering saline shots to children at their parents' request. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Dr. Moore provided a choice when the government did not, and that he did not deserve prison time. The decision to drop the charges, which was supported by Republican lawmakers, was filed "in the interests of justice," ending a case that could have resulted in a lengthy prison sentence.</p>

          <h2>Campaigners Urge English Labeling on Cosmetics to Protect Allergy Sufferers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 03:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement in the UK is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the standard Latin-based nomenclature, arguing the current system poses a serious risk to individuals with allergies. Campaigners, including a Member of Parliament with a severe nut allergy, highlight that consumers cannot be expected to recognize allergens listed under their scientific names. While some brands voluntarily provide English translations, it is not a legal requirement. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system, known as INCI, stating it provides a globally harmonized language for ingredient identification, but critics insist safety should be prioritized with clearer labeling.</p>

          <p>Following a high-level meeting between their respective foreign ministers, North Korea has publicly pledged its unconditional support for Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. North Korean state media reported that the country would back all measures taken by Russia, framing the conflict as a response to the root causes of the crisis. The meeting between North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui and Russia's Sergei Lavrov was described as a strategic dialogue, culminating in a bilateral exchange plan for 2026-2027. This declaration reinforces the deepening ties between the two nations, which includes a mutual-defense pact and previous reports of North Korea supplying Russia with troops and munitions.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room has been unraveled through a complex investigation into her unconventional 'throuple' relationship with Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo. After Seiden's body was discovered, investigators connected the crime to a bloody scene in Room 15 of the Sportsman's Lodge Motel, where the trio had been staying. The case, which took nearly six years to go to trial, revealed a history of jealousy, alcohol-fueled violence, and manipulation. Ultimately, Araujo took a plea deal and testified against Abell, who was convicted of second-degree murder, with both now facing lengthy prison sentences for their roles in the brutal killing.</p>

          <p>Kindergartens across China are grappling with the severe economic consequences of the nation's declining birth rate, forcing many to change their operational models to survive. In northeastern China, a government-affiliated kindergarten that once exclusively served the children of officials has now opened enrollment to the general public due to a shortage of pupils. This trend is nationwide, with official data showing a 13% drop in the number of kindergartens since 2020 and a 25.5% decrease in student enrollment over the same period. The situation reflects the broader demographic challenges China faces and the resulting strain on its education sector and economy.</p>

          <p>Audio captured by a neighbor's security camera played a crucial role in the conviction of Melissa Turner for the murder of her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler, near Tampa, Florida. After Trussler was found dead, Turner claimed self-defense, stating he had strangled her during an argument. However, investigators discovered surveillance footage that recorded sounds of a woman screaming phrases like "So f****** die" from the couple's home. This evidence, along with footage from an in-home camera showing Turner's movements, contradicted her self-defense narrative. Prosecutors argued the evidence proved she was the aggressor, leading a jury to find her guilty of second-degree murder.</p>

By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, the study found that low-flow water levels in February rose by over 50%.

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a commanding 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in a final that lasted just 57 minutes. The 24-year-old from Poland was flawless, delivering the first double-bagel in a Wimbledon women's final in 114 years. This marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and extends her perfect record in major finals to 6-0. For Anisimova, who was playing in her first Grand Slam final after a career break in 2023, the match was a difficult conclusion to an otherwise remarkable comeback journey that saw her defeat the world's number one player in the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old farmworker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during a large-scale federal immigration raid at a cannabis farm in Camarillo, California. The Department of Homeland Security stated the man was not being pursued by law enforcement when he fell. The raids at two farm sites resulted in the arrest of over 300 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and sparked tense protests. The incident has intensified criticism of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, leading to a federal judge temporarily halting such raids in Southern California amid widespread community fear.</p>

          <p>Severe weather has struck northeastern Spain, with torrential rains and flooding in the Catalonia region leaving two people missing. Firefighters are conducting a search along the Foix river near Cubelles for the missing individuals. The national weather service issued a red "extreme risk" alert for Catalonia and Aragon, with heavy rainfall causing significant travel disruptions, including blocked roads and suspended rail services in Barcelona. A plane departing from the city was also forced to return after sustaining damage in a hailstorm. The severe weather is attributed to a "cold drop" phenomenon, which has caused deadly floods in Spain in the past.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly expressed support for Attorney General Pam Bondi, urging unity among his supporters following internal disputes over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Tensions flared after the DOJ and FBI announced they would not release additional records and stated that a rumored "client list" never existed, disappointing far-right figures who had been promised bombshell revelations. The decision reportedly led to a heated confrontation between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. In a social media post, Trump defended Bondi's performance and dismissed the focus on Epstein, urging his followers to avoid infighting.</p>

          <p>Renowned Chinese mathematician Hong Wang, a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has become a target for cyber-nationalists in her home country. The criticism erupted after she delivered academic lectures in English during a recent tour of top Chinese universities. Despite being born in China and a graduate of Peking University, online critics have attacked her for not using Mandarin in her presentations. Wang, who is now an associate professor at New York University, has made significant breakthroughs in her field, but this incident highlights a growing trend of online nationalism in China targeting prominent figures for perceived slights to national pride.</p>
