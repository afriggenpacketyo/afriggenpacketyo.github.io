          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging President Aleksandar Vucic's increasingly autocratic rule, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The movement gained momentum after a train station collapse in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people and was widely attributed to corruption. Protests have spread across the country, with a massive demonstration in Belgrade drawing nearly half a million people, and students are collaborating with workers and trade unions to raise international awareness, even cycling to Strasbourg to bring the situation to the European Parliament. Despite government attempts to undermine the movement, protesters remain determined to bring about change through horizontal decision-making and solidarity, setting an example for the world.</p>

          <p>The International Chamber of Shipping anticipates that shipping companies will adapt to evolving trade barriers resulting from global trade disputes. Guy Platten, the chamber's secretary-general, emphasizes the industry's resilience due to the mobility of ships. This comes as the US has imposed tariffs on imports and proposed fees targeting Chinese vessels, set to take effect in mid-October. The US Trade Representative aims to re-establish the US shipbuilding industry and enhance national security, charging fees per net tonne for vessels owned or operated by companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau, as well as fees for Chinese-built vessels entering US ports.</p>

          <p>The PKK Kurdish militant group has announced its decision to disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey, marking a potential end to a decades-long armed conflict. This announcement follows calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan for the group to convene a congress and formally decide to disband, recognizing that the armed struggle has achieved its initial purpose. The PKK, which has been engaged in an armed insurgency since 1984, stated that its struggle has brought the Kurdish issue to a point where it can be resolved through democratic politics, leading to the termination of activities carried out under the 'PKK' name. Ocalan is expected to lead the disarming process.</p>

          <p>A student at a prestigious national elementary school in Tokyo was forced to quit after being a victim of bullying, marking the second consecutive year the school has reported a "serious" incident to the education ministry.

Principal Akihiro Sasaki expressed regret that the school failed to take proper action, and stated that an investigation into the case has not yet started. The number of bullying cases recognized as "serious" has hit a record high in fiscal 2023, reflecting a more proactive stance by schools in recognizing such cases.</p>

          <p>A DW article explores the addictive nature of sugar and its detrimental effects on health, noting that sugar lights up parts of the brain that make us feel good, but also causes addiction. While it's debated whether sugar is a true addictive substance, chronic overconsumption can alter neuronal pathways in the brain, leading to cravings and overconsumption, especially in individuals experiencing stress or challenging early life experiences. The article highlights the overwhelming evidence that sugar overconsumption can lead to various health problems, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. Strategies to quit sugar addiction include behavioral interventions, nutritional strategies, and government interventions such as sugar taxes to deter people from buying sugary foods and drinks.</p>

          <p>As the US administration under President Trump raises echoes of the Monroe Doctrine, China's leader, Xi Jinping, is hosting President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other Latin American officials in Beijing to emphasize China's firm foothold in the region. Many Latin American governments seek to keep Beijing as an economic partner and a counterweight to US power. China has become a major purchaser of minerals and resources from Latin America, while Chinese products and investments have filled markets in the region. However, concerns are growing in Latin America that Chinese exporters shut out of the US market will divert cheap goods there, potentially harming local manufacturers.</p>

The article highlights concerns about the army's readiness to fight a war, weaknesses in NATO commitments, and the impact of prolonged deployments on personnel. While the government plans to address these issues with a Strategic Defence Review, doubts remain about its effectiveness due to budget constraints and the complexity of modern warfare. The article also notes that low morale and cases of harassment are contributing to recruitment and retention problems within the armed forces.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut Medicaid by at least $880 billion to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation includes new work and eligibility requirements, which Democrats warn will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. Republicans argue they are rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, while Democrats claim the cuts are an attempt to repeal Obamacare.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic power outage affecting much of Spain, Portugal, and the south of France has ignited a debate about the role of renewables and energy security. The blackout, which lasted for several hours, disrupted daily life across the region, stranding train passengers and cutting off phone and internet coverage. While Spanish authorities investigate the cause, some observers have suggested that the high reliance on wind and solar energy in Spain and Portugal may have contributed to the outage.

          <p>Top military officials from India and Pakistan are scheduled to discuss the finer details of a ceasefire, brokered by the US, aimed at halting recent hostilities in the disputed Kashmir region. The ceasefire follows nearly four days of intense shelling and aerial incursions from both sides, escalating tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors. While both nations have ceased hostilities since the agreement, they remain vigilant and warn each other against violating the ceasefire. The tensions were the latest in a long-standing rivalry, with both countries claiming military victory after the recent fighting.</p>

          <p>The Guardian examines the history and rules surrounding gifts given to U.S. presidents, triggered by reports of Donald Trump's administration considering accepting a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family. The article details the legal framework, including the emoluments clause, which restricts government office holders from accepting gifts from foreign powers without Congressional approval. Most gifts are disposed of through a bureaucratic process, transferred to the National Archives or presidential libraries, or retained by the president upon payment of fair market value. The article also highlights past instances of presidential gift-giving and the ethical considerations involved.</p>

The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Ukraine to accept Russia's latest offer to hold direct talks in Turkey.

          <p>House Republicans have released a plan that would cause millions of low-income Americans to lose Medicaid health coverage and increase costs for millions more. The proposal, part of a broader bill to enact President Trumpâ€™s domestic agenda, aims to cut $880 billion in spending over a decade. The legislation omits some of the deepest cuts to Medicaid that ultraconservative Republicans have demanded, but it would still impose new work requirements and increase paperwork, leading to coverage losses.

The project will assess disease risks and engage with the public and landowners to gain support.

The US mediation is seen as providing a useful off-ramp for both nations, with Saudi Arabia and Iran also playing key mediating roles.
