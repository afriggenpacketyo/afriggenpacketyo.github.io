          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at revitalizing the nuclear power industry, leading to a rally in nuclear stocks. The orders focus on small, advanced reactors and streamline the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) licensing process, mandating decisions within 18 months. The actions also support uranium mining and domestic enrichment, while creating a regulatory framework for building reactors on federal land.

The lawsuit accuses the administration of a ‚Äúcampaign of retribution‚Äù against the university. Harvard sought a temporary restraining order, arguing the ban would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university, which was granted by a Boston judge.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna setup during construction.

The Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon to address safety concerns after the incident, which follows a deadly midair collision earlier this year.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved the merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing previous objections based on national security concerns. Trump stated that the partnership would create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel maintaining its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The announcement led to a surge in U.S. Steel shares. This decision contrasts with former President Biden's earlier block of the acquisition.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, Iran and the United States made modest progress during talks in Rome regarding Iran‚Äôs nuclear program. Oman's foreign minister noted "some but not conclusive progress," with hopes to clarify remaining issues for a sustainable agreement. The main issue is Washington's demand for Iran to halt nuclear enrichment, while Iran insists on its right to enrichment at lower levels. Despite the core disagreement, both sides aim to resolve their dispute, with Tehran exchanging nuclear program limits for lifted sanctions.</p>
