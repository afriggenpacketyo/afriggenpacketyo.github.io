          <p>Negotiations are set to continue between Birmingham City Council and the Unite union to resolve the ongoing bin workers' strike, now in its seventh week. The strike has led to significant waste accumulation, prompting a major incident declaration due to public health and environmental worries. Despite some improvements in waste collection reported by residents, Unite seeks written confirmation of council promises to reach a deal. The government urges both parties to negotiate in good faith to restore reliable waste services for residents.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London have been downgraded to official level, with key US figures no longer participating. Ukrainian President Zelensky has firmly rejected recognizing occupied Crimea as Russian territory, countering reports suggesting this concession might be discussed. Despite Russia's claim of an Easter weekend ceasefire, reports suggest attacks continued.

          <p>BP shares experienced a significant jump after activist investor Elliott disclosed a stake exceeding 5% in the oil major. This move is anticipated to pressure BP to shift its focus back towards its core oil and gas businesses, deviating from its green strategy. BP had previously announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027 after posting a steep drop in fourth-quarter profit. This strategic adjustment occurred as crude prices declined amidst trade tensions between the US and China.</p>

          <p>China is actively inviting European countries to form a united front against President Trump's tariff policies, which it views as a weaponization of trade. China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, has accused Washington of violating WTO rules and harming global economic interests. China is urging Europe to join forces with Beijing to defend the multilateral trading system. Beijing has been increasing its efforts to gain support amidst rising frictions with Washington, particularly after the US imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on most goods arriving in the US from China.</p>

          <p>Netflix's 'Stranger Things: The First Shadow' has officially opened on Broadway, transforming the Marquis Theatre into a franchise extension. Directed by Stephen Daldry, the production combines the fluidity of the screen with the dynamism of the stage, attracting a younger audience. However, the play's plot is criticized for being convoluted and squeezing an entire season of the series into a single performance. Despite the spectacular visual effects, the script is deemed lacking, making the experience more about sensation than substance.</p>
