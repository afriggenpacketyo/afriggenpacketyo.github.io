        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Budget Director Russell Vought stated that President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the conservative Project 2025 blueprint. Vought, a key author of the overall project, claimed ignorance of the specific chapter calling for an overhaul of the Fed's mandate to focus solely on stable money. The Trump administration has recently intensified criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, focusing on office renovation costs, while the Fed remains cautious due to potential inflation from Trump's tariffs. This article highlights the tension between the administration's policy goals and institutional changes proposed by conservative strategists.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie is warning that blocking a House vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein could become a political liability for the GOP in the midterm elections. Alongside Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, Massie is pushing for the vote against the wishes of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has called the effort "reckless" over concerns about protecting victims. Massie refutes this, stating their bill includes redactions for victims' names and ensures no child pornography is released. The internal GOP division highlights the pressure from the party's base to release the documents, a move the Trump administration has so far resisted.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major new contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors, leading to a more than 2% rise in its share price during early trading. The South Korean technology giant did not disclose the name of the other party involved in the substantial deal. This news comes as Samsung prepares to release its quarterly earnings report, with analysts expecting a significant profit decline. The company has been facing challenges in competing with rivals like SK Hynix, particularly in the booming market for artificial intelligence chips, making this contract a notable development.</p>

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has officially rejected any diplomatic engagement with South Korea's new liberal government, stating that Pyongyang has no interest in talks. This declaration signals North Korea's continued focus on its strengthening alliance with Russia, to which it is reportedly supplying weapons for the war in Ukraine in exchange for economic and military aid. The statement marks a formal rebuke of recent appeasement efforts by South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung. This development further solidifies North Korea's recent constitutional change that removed the goal of peaceful unification and defined South Korea as its "invariable principal enemy."</p>

The explosives were then moved to a secure storage facility for collection by the U.S. military. This incident occurred less than two weeks after a separate explosion killed three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives, adding to heightened concerns about the handling of such dangerous materials in the region.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison has announced its intention to include a major Chinese strategic investor in the consortium bidding for its $22.8 billion global ports business. This move comes as an exclusivity period with the original bidding group, led by BlackRock and MSC, has expired. The deal, which includes two ports near the Panama Canal, has become politically sensitive due to escalating US-China tensions, with Beijing reportedly viewing the initial consortium as a proxy for American influence. Reports suggest that state-owned China COSCO Shipping Corp is now exploring a role in the bid, a change CK Hutchison says is necessary to secure regulatory approvals.</p>

Despite heavy rain and slippery conditions on the final stage in Paris, which had been neutralized for safety, Pogačar displayed his characteristic daring by launching an attack rather than finishing safely in the pack. Although he did not win the final stage, which went to Belgian rider Wout van Aert, his overall lead was insurmountable. Pogačar finished 4 minutes and 24 seconds ahead of two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, marking the fifth consecutive year the two rivals have finished first and second in the prestigious race.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a significant increase in applications for their citizenship by investment (CBI) programs, largely driven by wealthy US citizens. For as little as $200,000, these programs offer a passport and visa-free travel to up to 150 countries, including the UK and Europe's Schengen area. Investment migration experts suggest that political and social volatility in the US, including concerns about gun violence and political instability, is fueling the demand.

An investigation found many organizations use social media to sell dogs from countries like Romania and Ukraine with minimal vetting, a process likened to a "Deliveroo for dogs." This has led to a rise in diseases like Brucella canis, which can pass to humans, and instances of aggression. While many rescuers are well-intentioned, experts warn the lack of proper assessment places a burden on UK shelters and poses risks to new owners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has shut down four major dark web sites and convicted at least 18 individuals in a global crackdown on child sexual abuse material, dubbed "Operation Grayskull." The network had over 120,000 members and hosted millions of files depicting the violent sexual assault of children. Among those convicted was William Spearman, a lead administrator of one site, who was sentenced to life in prison. Officials described the operation as one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community where members traded horrific content and used encryption to evade law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This article presents a case for investing in Honeywell (HON) following a significant drop in its stock price after a positive earnings report. The author attributes the decline to market impatience with the company's long-term plan to split into three separate entities, a lack of significant data center exposure, and complex internal structures. Despite these factors, the author expresses strong conviction in the company's underlying value, citing its leadership in aerospace, automation, and advanced materials. The author plans to purchase more shares, viewing the current market discouragement as an overreaction and a buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

The film, which also earned $100 million internationally for a global debut of $218 million, stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Its success, alongside the recent strong performance of DC's "Superman," suggests that audience appetite for superhero films remains high, challenging the narrative of so-called "superhero fatigue."</p>

On Gaza, Starmer must navigate a delicate diplomatic path between the U.S. stance and that of European allies like France, which recently announced it would recognize a Palestinian state.
