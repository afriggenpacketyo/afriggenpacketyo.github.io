        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed mechanism for organ donation between Hong Kong and mainland China has been stalled due to legal obstacles, particularly regulations preventing the transfer of organs across the border to control the spread of HIV. Wang Haibo, director of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), stated that revisions to mainland laws are necessary to facilitate the establishment of this cross-border mechanism. The specific law hindering progress relates to controls aimed at preventing the spread of HIV, as organs, blood, and tissue cannot be transferred across the border under current regulations. COTRS is a national system responsible for allocating organs for transplants throughout the country.</p>

          <p>Korean Air, Jeju Air, and Tâ€™way Air have been collectively fined US$2.6 million by the South Korean government for violating the Aviation Safety Act. The fines were imposed following increased scrutiny of aviation safety standards after a Jeju Air flight crash-landed in December, resulting in casualties. In addition to the fines, the government suspended the licenses of eight aviation maintenance engineers from the three airlines for periods ranging from 15 to 45 days. The decision was finalized after a penalty review committee meeting held in early April, highlighting the government's commitment to enforcing stricter safety measures in the aviation industry.</p>

          <p>Italian filmmaker Silvio Soldini's "The Tasters" is a fictional adaptation of the story of Margot WÃ¶lk, who was one of Hitler's food tasters, inspired by Rosella Postorino's novel "At the Wolf's Table." The film follows Rosa Sauer, a young woman forcibly recruited to taste Hitler's food, and explores her relationships amid the tension of potentially poisoned meals. While the historical accuracy of WÃ¶lk's claims has been debated, the film focuses on the human aspects of individuals caught within a horrific system, rather than a strictly historical account. Soldini emphasizes that the story's relevance lies in its portrayal of parallels with contemporary political violence, where individuals can be affected even with privilege.</p>

Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margin to face pressure in the short term due to the need to hit sales targets, but they anticipate the company will offset the impact through larger sales scale and low battery costs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Hong Kongâ€™s Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu has criticized the MTR Corporation for inadequacies in emergency responses and contingency planning following recent service disruptions. These disruptions include a five-hour suspension on the Tseung Kwan O line. Lee highlighted the need for the rail giant to improve prevention measures to avoid future incidents. The MTR Corporation, which is nearly 75 per cent government-owned, was fined HK$19.2 million (US$2.4 million) following its third disruption in four months caused by technical failure.</p>

          <p>A campaign called #TakingThePIP has been launched by deaf, disabled, and neurodivergent public figures to protest proposed benefits cuts in the UK. The cuts, which aim to tighten eligibility criteria for personal independence payment (Pip) and reduce universal credit, could severely impact disabled people's ability to survive. Many individuals rely on these benefits for essential needs such as electricity for breathing equipment and wheelchair charging. The campaign aims to raise awareness about the potential consequences of the cuts, which could lead to increased homelessness and food bank usage among disabled families.</p>
