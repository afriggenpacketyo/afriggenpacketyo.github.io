          <p>The UK government expressed relief, rather than delight, at the relatively moderate 10% tariff imposed on its exports to the US, acknowledging the significant impact on various industries.

The UK government is acutely aware of the potential disruption to its car industry and the broader implications of the tariffs on global trade flows.  The differing responses of the UK and EU to the tariffs are being interpreted through the lens of Brexit by some.</p>

          <p>Hungary announced its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), a decision made shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's arrival in Hungary.  Netanyahu is subject to an ICC arrest warrant.  The Hungarian government cited the ICC's alleged deviation from its original purpose and its issuance of the warrant against Netanyahu as reasons for withdrawal.  This action marks Hungary as the first EU nation to leave the ICC and raises questions about the court's future and international cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs represent a significant shift in global trade, potentially the most substantial change in a century.  The universal 10% tariff and additional levies on countries with trade surpluses will have far-reaching consequences.
