          <p>A recent New York court ruling deemed President Trump's blanket import taxes illegal, raising questions about its impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. However, the ruling does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. While the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, the agreement has yet to be implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, leaving the future uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the crucial role of UK saltmarshes as carbon sinks, locking away greenhouse gases in layers of mud. Saltmarshes have been largely lost to agriculture, but the charity is advocating for their recognition in the UK's official carbon emission and removal inventory. Researchers from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology used monitoring stations to measure gas exchange in a restored saltmarsh, revealing that plants absorb more carbon dioxide in summer than they release in winter. The report emphasizes the importance of protecting and restoring these habitats for climate change mitigation and coastal flood defense.</p>

          <p>In 1950, the U.S. government deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, a decision that profoundly impacted the Cold War. Despite his contributions to American aerospace and weaponry, he was deported amidst McCarthy-era hysteria. Upon returning to China, Qian persuaded Mao Zedong to initiate a modern weapons program, leading to China's first missile test by the end of the decade. The article argues that this deportation was a significant misstep that fueled China's rise as a superpower and cautions against repeating such actions with current foreign students and researchers.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first debate in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to choose separate surnames. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three opposition-submitted bills appears unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A revision to the Civil Code is necessary to enable couples to maintain different family names, a change that has been increasingly advocated for by business leaders and supported by a majority of the public.</p>

          <p>President Trump has launched an attack on conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, accusing him of being a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This outburst came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled against most of his tariffs. Trump criticized the judges and expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming they gave him bad advice on judicial nominations. Leo, in response, expressed gratitude for Trump's transformation of the federal courts. The president's attacks are notable given Leo's long-standing alliance with him in selecting conservative judges.</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk, known for terrorizing the village of Flamstead, has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed Bomber Harris, was captured in April after attacking approximately 50 people. Falconer Wayne Housden has been training the bird and reports that it has calmed down significantly. Housden plans to showcase Bomber Harris at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival and eventually release him in the autumn. The falconer believes the hawk's behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial issues and is committed to providing a stable environment for the bird.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signifies a shift in the regulatory landscape, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the crypto industry. Binance has recently established ties with World Liberty Financial, a project with links to the Trump family.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist warns that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the rivalry between China and the United States. While the chance of full-scale financial sanctions remains slim, Washington could gradually target specific Chinese entities, potentially pushing China out of the US dollar system. The economist notes that implementing full-blown sanctions would be difficult due to China's significant role in global trade and investment. Such measures could also undermine the Swift system, as countries shift to China's alternative settlement system.</p>
