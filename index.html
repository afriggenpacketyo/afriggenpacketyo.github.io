Meanwhile, in the West of England, Labour grapples with allegations against its incumbent mayor, as the Liberal Democrats and Greens position themselves as strong challengers, focusing on sustainability and local issues.

            <p>The Trump administration will impose fees on Chinese-built vessels arriving at U.S. ports, following a USTR investigation that found China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage. The fees, which start at zero and incrementally increase over several years, aim to reverse Chinese dominance and incentivize U.S.-built ships. Vessel owners can get fee remission by ordering U.S. ships. The fees do not cover Great Lakes or Caribbean shipping and exempt bulk exports. The decision follows public comments from trade groups warning against an economic war that would harm ocean carriers using Chinese-made vessels.</p>

The most common side effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues. Eli Lilly plans to seek FDA approval for orforglipron as a Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026 and will submit it for weight management approval by the end of this year.</p>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a funding shortfall after the government failed to provide them with the same level of compensation for tax increases as the police. While police forces are receiving extra funds to cover the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions, fire services will only receive top-up funds covering about 50% of the increase. This shortfall could equate to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine. The National Fire Chiefs Council says fire services will be £20m short of the £40m needed to cover national insurance increases.</p>

The project is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies to fight climate change, with potential for large-scale carbon removal if powered by renewable energy.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike over the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO), which could lead to pay cuts for some workers. The union claims that some workers could face pay cuts of up to £8,000, while the council estimates the maximum loss would be "just over £6,000". The dispute centers on the value of the WRCO role and whether its removal could open the council up to equal pay claims.</p>
