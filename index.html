          <p>The Tate Modern art gallery in London has announced plans to extend its opening times to 9:00 PM on Fridays and Saturdays starting this autumn. This decision aims to increase accessibility, particularly for younger audiences and those who work during the day, building on the success of its popular "Tate Modern Lates" evening events. The gallery, which offers free general admission, hopes the later hours will further solidify London's reputation as a global cultural hub. Officials believe this will provide more opportunities for the public to engage with the national collection of modern art.</p>

          <p>The upcoming world swimming championships are set to feature a highly anticipated duel between Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh and American veteran Katie Ledecky. McIntosh is attempting to win an unprecedented five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has accomplished. Their clash in the 800m freestyle is being billed as the meet's defining moment, pitting the dominant Ledecky against the only swimmer to have defeated her in the event in 15 years. The race could signal a significant generational shift in the sport of swimming.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for international cooperation to establish a global consensus on the governance of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need to balance development with security. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference, he warned against AI becoming the exclusive domain of a few nations and announced a Chinese-led body to promote open-source development. This call comes amid escalating tech competition with the United States, which has imposed restrictions on chip exports to China. Li criticized monopolistic control and advocated for open access to AI technologies for broader global benefit.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team has achieved its first win under head coach Sean Lynn by defeating Australia in a match in Brisbane. After suffering losses in all five of their Six Nations games, this victory provides a significant morale boost just weeks before the Rugby World Cup. Wales overcame an early Australian try and a weather delay, with Nel Metcalfe scoring twice to lead the team. Despite second-half pressure from the Wallaroos, a strong defensive performance secured the encouraging 14-12 win for Wales.</p>

          <p>A prominent pro-life group is hailing the upcoming closure of two Planned Parenthood facilities in Houston, Texas, as a major victory for their movement. The closures include what the group described as the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere. Planned Parenthood cited rising operational costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates as reasons for shutting down the centers on September 30. This development occurs in the context of ongoing efforts by Republican-led states and politicians to restrict abortion access and defund the organization following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>Spain's women's national football team is set to face England in the Euro 2025 final, marking a significant moment of transformation for the squad. Their 2023 World Cup victory was overshadowed by a scandal involving the former federation president, Luis Rubiales, who was found guilty of sexual assault for kissing a player without consent. Since then, the team has undergone profound changes, with players reporting a much healthier and more professional environment focused solely on football. This final offers the team a chance to celebrate a major title without the cloud of controversy that marred their previous triumph.</p>

          <p>Recent deadly clashes on the Thai-Cambodian border highlight the significant military imbalance between the two nations, which have been in a long-standing territorial dispute. Thailand, a longtime U.S. ally, possesses a much larger, better-funded, and more technologically advanced military, including a superior air force. In contrast, Cambodia's younger armed forces rely heavily on support and equipment from China, which has helped develop a naval base in the country. While Thailand has a clear advantage in personnel and weaponry, analysts note that the terrain in the disputed region may favor Cambodian forces.</p>

The outcome could reshape the power balance in the legislature, potentially giving the ruling Democratic Progressive Party a majority.

          <p>NASA is confronting a significant workforce challenge, as nearly 4,000 employees, representing more than one-fifth of its staff, have applied for departure through a government-wide buyout program. This potential exodus could shrink the agency's civil servant workforce from 18,000 to 14,000, raising concerns about its ability to maintain operational capacity and safety standards. The applications come as NASA faces proposed budget cuts of around 25% for fiscal year 2026. The situation is further complicated by a recent leadership crisis, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the future of America's space exploration efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a period of low scoring, the team has now posted five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Veteran outfielder Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, hitting a crucial two-run homer, while Andy Pages also continued his recent positive trend with multiple hits. The improved hitting performance provided solid support for the pitching staff and comes as the team evaluates its needs ahead of the upcoming trade deadline.</p>

          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top scientific and engineering talent, including PhD candidates from U.S. universities who face funding cuts and stricter visa policies.

This trend allows China's rapidly growing quant sector to bolster its capabilities as it competes with established global financial giants.

          <h2>House Democrats Formally Request Epstein 'Birthday Book' Reportedly Containing Trump Contribution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:43:37 EDT</div>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for the late sex offender. The request follows reports that the book contains a crude poem and doodle contributed by Donald Trump, a claim Trump is suing over. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's decisions regarding related files. This move intensifies the political focus on the Epstein case and Trump's past association with him.</p>
