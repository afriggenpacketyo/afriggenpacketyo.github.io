          <p>President Trump has identified Vice President JD Vance as the probable frontrunner to succeed him as the leader of the Republican party. When asked by a reporter, Trump stated it was early but that Vance is "most likely" the leading contender and is doing a "great job." The president also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio as another potential figure, suggesting he might collaborate with Vance in the future. Both Vance and Rubio, once critics of Trump, are now viewed as key allies and potential candidates for the 2028 presidential nomination.</p>

          <p>A newly reported letter allegedly written by Woody Allen for Jeffrey Epstein's birthday describes the convicted sex offender's Manhattan townhouse as being like "Castle Dracula." According to documents obtained by the New York Times, Allen detailed attending dinner parties at the residence, noting the wide variety of guests and the food. He reportedly made a bizarre comparison, stating that the young women serving at the house were reminiscent of female vampires servicing Dracula's castle. The letter offers a strange glimpse into the social circles surrounding Epstein before his death.</p>

          <p>The Rwandan government has announced an agreement to accept up to 250 migrant deportees from the United States, joining Eswatini and South Sudan in the controversial program. A government spokesperson confirmed the deal, stating that Rwanda will have the ability to approve each individual and will provide them with support like workforce training and healthcare. This development follows a similar but ultimately failed deal between Rwanda and the United Kingdom, which was struck down by the UK's Supreme Court. Human rights activists have expressed concern that such policies could violate international law.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena to the Department of Justice for all records related to its investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Committee Chair James Comer stated that congressional oversight of the government's handling of sex trafficking laws, and these cases specifically, is imperative. The committee also subpoenaed several high-profile figures for testimony, including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This move could lead to a confrontation between Congress and the White House over the release of sensitive information.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a White House task force to oversee the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, naming himself as its chair. This move signals a potentially more active role for a sitting president in Olympic planning than is traditional. During the announcement, Trump stated he would use the National Guard or military if necessary to ensure the Games' safety, a comment that may prove contentious following recent military deployments in the city. The task force will coordinate federal efforts for security, transportation, and visa processing for the international event.</p>

Authorities believe Brown, who family members say has a history of mental illness, is armed and extremely dangerous. The shooting has deeply shaken the small community, and federal authorities are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that missed analyst expectations, causing its stock to fall in after-hours trading. While the company's overall revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, its earnings per share came in slightly below projections. The company's AI business revenue saw a year-over-year decline, largely attributed to U.S. export restrictions to China, which cost it an estimated $800 million in sales for the quarter. AMD's data center and client segments showed strong growth, but concerns over the impact of export controls and the transition to next-generation chips weighed on investor sentiment.

          <p>Escalating trade disputes between the United States and India are casting a shadow over a potential visit by President Trump and the future of the Quad strategic alliance. The White House has been seeking significant "deliverables" for Trump to announce, but a lack of a breakthrough on a trade agreement makes the trip increasingly unlikely. Trump's recent threats to increase tariffs and criticism of India's oil purchases from Russia have reportedly embittered New Delhi.

City officials justify the move by citing declining cannabis tax revenue and the need for the Department of Cannabis Regulation to be self-funding. Business owners argue the higher fees, such as a renewal fee jumping from about $8,500 to over $12,600, could be disastrous and force more closures. The industry is already contending with high taxes, lack of access to traditional banking, and intense competition from the illicit market.</p>

CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weakness to a flawed advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and trade policy changes.

          <h2>California Braces for Intense Heat Wave That Could Worsen Active Wildfires</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities across California are on high alert as a prolonged heat wave is expected to intensify fire conditions throughout the state. The heat is forecast to worsen several large fires already burning in Southern and Central California, including the state's largest blaze of the year, the Gifford fire. While strong winds are not currently predicted, the combination of extremely high temperatures, dry vegetation, and low humidity creates dangerous conditions for new fires to start and spread rapidly. Officials warn of increased risk for heat-related illnesses and have issued heat advisories for much of inland California.</p>

          <p>Ion Iliescu, a central and deeply divisive figure in Romania's transition from communism to democracy, has passed away at the age of 95. Iliescu rose to power during the chaotic 1989 revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and he served as the country's first democratically elected president. While credited with steering Romania towards eventual NATO and EU membership, his legacy is marred by controversy. He was criticized for his role in the violent suppression of protests in the 1990s, known as the Mineriads, and for his reluctance to fully break from the country's communist-era structures and personnel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Atlantic examines the origins and evolution of the term "Russia hoax," a phrase frequently used by Donald Trump and his allies. While U.S. intelligence and a bipartisan Senate report concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, the "hoax" narrative has persisted and its definition has shifted over time. The piece argues that the claim is itself a successful hoax aimed at discrediting investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. It also notes that recent efforts by Trump allies to prove the hoax theory have been debunked by investigations.</p>

Hinge Health also provided strong guidance for its third-quarter and full-year revenue, signaling continued growth. Despite a significant net loss largely due to stock-based compensation expenses related to its IPO, investors responded positively to the strong revenue growth and optimistic forecast in the burgeoning digital health sector.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly instructed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding allegations that the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation was a politically motivated conspiracy. This move follows claims by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that Obama-era officials politicized intelligence to falsely link Trump to Russia. The grand jury will decide if formal charges are warranted, though it remains unclear who could be charged or for what specific crimes. The step escalates a long-running political battle over the legitimacy of the initial investigation into Russian election interference.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable and resulted from OceanGate's use of "intimidation tactics" to evade safety regulations. The final report states the company operated outside established protocols by exploiting regulatory confusion. It found the vessel's design was inadequate and its integrity was likely compromised in previous incidents. The report also faulted the late CEO Stockton Rush for overconfidence and fostering a "toxic" safety culture where employee concerns were ignored, adding he likely would have faced a criminal investigation had he survived.</p>

Prosecutors are expected to ask a grand jury to indict Elias Rodriguez on the new charges for the May 21 shooting of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. Rodriguez was reportedly seen shouting pro-Palestinian slogans and told police he "did it for Palestine." To secure a hate crime conviction, prosecutors will need to prove his actions were motivated by antisemitism, not just political opposition to Israel.</p>

          <p>The recent political standoff in Texas, where Democratic lawmakers fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, highlights how gerrymandering has become a high-stakes political blood sport. This article from NPR explains that while the practice of drawing partisan maps is centuries old, the intensity of these fights has escalated dramatically. With the Supreme Court ruling in 2019 that federal courts cannot block purely partisan gerrymandering, states have become the primary battlegrounds. The outcome of these disputes, like the one in Texas, could single-handedly determine which party controls the U.S. Congress.</p>

Following the remarks, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave both Hassett and Warsh a 35% chance of being the next Fed chair.

          <p>This article provides a financial comparison between placing $10,000 in a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account. Currently, a top high-yield savings account at 4.30% would earn slightly more over three months ($105.81) than a 3-month CD at 4.25% ($104.60). However, the CD rate is guaranteed, while the savings account rate is variable and could fall, especially with potential interest rate cuts looming. The choice depends on a saver's goals, as CDs offer rate security but restrict access to funds, whereas savings accounts provide flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
