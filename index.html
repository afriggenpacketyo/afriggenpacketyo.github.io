          <p>A Trump administration executive order is set to expand the ability of 401(k) fund managers to incorporate private equity into retirement portfolios. This move introduces new potential for higher returns but also carries significant risks, as private equity is typically less transparent and more volatile than traditional public market investments. The change prompts a debate over the balance between growth opportunities and the security of Americans' retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>

The crew, which was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease, found the situation "hilarious." After being corrected by HM Coastguard, Mr. Lowe donated £1,000 to their cause, though he stood by his vigilance, citing the "national crisis" of illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Health authorities in Guangdong, China, are battling a chikungunya fever outbreak, a virus spread by Aedes mosquitoes. While officials are penalizing businesses for failing to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, some experts argue this approach is misguided. They point out that the primary vector for chikungunya in the region, Aedes aegypti, is rare, and that broad-spectrum mosquito eradication efforts may not be effectively targeting the specific mosquitoes carrying the virus. The outbreak is exacerbated by a hot, humid, and rainy climate favorable for mosquito proliferation.</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire in the Aude region of southern France, the largest in decades, has been brought under control by firefighters. The blaze, which started on Tuesday, has scorched over 17,000 hectares, resulted in one fatality, and injured thirteen others. Despite being contained, about 2,000 firefighters remain on duty as the fire is not yet fully extinguished. The incident has also led to the destruction of homes and vehicles, power outages, and the cancellation of some train services due to an impending heatwave.</p>

          <p>The pervasive issue of smartphone addiction is leading some people, particularly young adults, to seek alternatives like "dumbphones" or older models like BlackBerrys. Cultural critics and producers discuss how smartphones are designed to capture and hold our attention, with their mere proximity affecting concentration. They suggest that managing this relationship requires more than just willpower, advocating for intentional time away from devices and creating moments of real-world connection to interrupt addictive phone habits. The trend reflects a growing awareness and desire to reclaim mental focus from technology.</p>

          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, has been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for conspiring to attack the power grid in Baltimore, Maryland. The judge described Russell as the "intellectual horsepower" behind the plot, which aimed to cause societal collapse in the majority-Black city. This case highlights the US government's efforts to combat violent right-wing extremism and marks another conviction for Russell, who previously pleaded guilty to explosives charges in a separate 2017 case.</p>

          <p>A leaked internal report accuses His Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) of a cover-up regarding a significant IT bug in its case-management software. The flaw, which existed for years, caused evidence in civil, family, and tribunal cases to be lost, overwritten, or hidden, potentially leading to miscarriages of justice. The report found that HMCTS management knew of the "large scale" data breaches but chose not to inform judges or lawyers, and sources within the agency have likened the situation to the Horizon Post Office scandal.</p>

          <p>The French mineral water industry, including iconic brand Perrier, is embroiled in a scandal over the use of illicit purification methods. Investigations revealed that due to contamination concerns linked to climate change, some companies have been treating their water with filters, a practice forbidden for products labeled "natural mineral water." This has led to accusations of industrial fraud and government collusion, and Perrier now faces the possibility of losing its "natural mineral water" status, potentially undermining the premium image that has defined the brand for over a century.</p>
