          <p>Starbucks has reported its sixth straight quarter of declining same-store sales, with a global drop of 2%. Despite this, CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence, stating the company's turnaround is ahead of schedule, drawing on his experience with Chipotle. The company is focusing on improving customer service with its "Green Apron Service" program and making cafes more comfortable, while also seeing a 2% sales growth in its key China market. For the upcoming quarter, the company remains conservative but plans significant investments in labor and future product innovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that the gunman in Monday's deadly Midtown Manhattan office shooting was targeting the NFL's headquarters. The shooter, Shane Tamura, left a note indicating he believed he had the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. Four people were killed, including an NYPD officer, after Tamura took the wrong elevator and opened fire in the offices of Rudin Management. The investigation is ongoing, with law enforcement examining Tamura's mental health history and the illegally assembled rifle used in the attack.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union has marginalized itself in global power dynamics due to a lack of a cohesive and autonomous strategy regarding China. The author contends that by submitting to US pressure and failing to assert its own interests, Brussels has become irrelevant to both Beijing and Washington. The recent EU-China summit yielded minimal gains for Europe, highlighting China's perception that it doesn't need to offer significant concessions. The piece concludes that Europe's adherence to liberal principles in a realist world has undermined its geopolitical leverage.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, is recovering after being kicked in the chest by a horse on his farm over the weekend. The incident, which resulted in a broken rib and bruising, occurred when a horsefly spooked the animal. Despite the injury, the 60-year-old congressman is reportedly in good spirits and has not altered his public schedule, even making light of the "cool mark" left by the horse's hooves. A doctor informed him he was fortunate the impact was not slightly higher on his chest.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a new executive order aimed at changing the nation's approach to homelessness, which has advocacy groups worried. The order seeks to make it easier for states and cities to move unhoused individuals into treatment for mental illness or addiction, including potential forced treatment. The administration argues that previous federal spending has not addressed the root causes of homelessness. However, critics are concerned that this new approach will also fail to solve these underlying issues and could infringe on individual rights.</p>

The author argues the policy is driven not by concerns of "globalism," but by resentment, insecurity, and fear within the administration's leadership. The ban is framed as a way for unqualified officials to avoid public embarrassment and to prevent anyone from misspeaking in a way that would draw President Trump's anger.

The extreme temperatures are concentrated in the Midwest, Southeast, and parts of the Northeast, with New York City breaking a record at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Many cities are experiencing "feels-like" temperatures exceeding 110 degrees, prompting health officials to issue warnings about heat-related illnesses.

Raised in a bilingual, first-generation household in Los Angeles, Rubio's music reflects her diverse influences, from Pedro Infante to No Doubt. After starting her career in alt-rock, she made a conscious decision to create music in Spanish to honor her heritage and tell her own story. The piece also touches on her activism, as she postponed her album release show to protest immigration raids and donated a portion of merchandise sales to an immigrant rights group.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy from South Carolina who recently died from a brain-eating amoeba, are raising public awareness about the rare but deadly infection. The infection, known as primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose. The family stated they were unaware of the risks of swimming in the lake where their son was infected and do not want his death to be in vain. This was the first known case in South Carolina since 2016, and health officials urge caution during recreational freshwater activities.</p>

          <p>During trade talks in Stockholm, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Chinese officials that their continued purchases of sanctioned Russian oil could lead to tariffs as high as 100%. Bessent referenced U.S. legislation authorizing such measures to cut off Russia's energy revenues and bolster support for Ukraine. According to Bessent, Chinese officials responded by asserting their energy sovereignty, stating that their oil purchases are based on internal policies. Bessent also expressed U.S. disapproval of China's sales of dual-use technology to Russia, which have aided Moscow's war effort. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest round of high-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China has ended without a deal to extend the current tariff pause, which is set to expire on August 12.

Without an extension, tariffs on Chinese goods could "boomerang" back to higher levels. While officials described the discussions as "constructive," the lack of a breakthrough leaves businesses facing continued uncertainty over the future of the trade relationship between the two economic superpowers.

          <p>With President Trump threatening to impose tariffs of up to 200% on imported pharmaceuticals, analysts are evaluating which companies might be most affected. According to a TD Cowen analyst, companies like Novartis and Roche appear more at risk due to their larger manufacturing footprints outside the U.S., while AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly seem better positioned. The analysis notes that significant tariffs could pressure companies' cash flow and potentially lead to R&D spending cuts. Drugmakers have warned that such levies could disrupt supply chains, raise patient costs, and stifle innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

The reviewer praises the film's direction, noting its clever use of misdirection and jump scares to build suspense.
