            <p>Residents in Wales are increasingly worried about the growing threat of wildfires due to climate change, as recent blazes have come dangerously close to homes. Fire crews have been working tirelessly to combat these fires, with one councillor describing the situation as dire. Experts warn that milder winters and spring droughts are exacerbating the problem, leading to more frequent and longer fire seasons. The community is also concerned about the impact of these fires on local wildlife and the ability of fire services to respond to other emergencies. Optimism is limited, but faith in the system remains.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent reversal on tariffs has sparked confusion and criticism, with economists questioning the consistency and rationale behind his trade policies. After initially announcing significant tariffs on numerous countries, Trump abruptly paused the measures, leading to market volatility and uncertainty among businesses. Experts suggest that this erratic approach undermines confidence in international trade agreements and creates a chilling effect on investment. The long-term economic consequences of Trump's trade war with China, including the potential for stagflation, are also a major concern. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government is contemplating nationalizing British Steel to prevent its collapse after negotiations with the Chinese owners, Jingye, faltered. Parliament is being recalled to grant the business secretary the power to intervene and provide financial support to keep the steel industry alive. The potential nationalization reflects a shift away from neoliberalism and a recognition of the importance of domestic steel production for infrastructure, defense, and economic growth. However, the move would require significant investment and faces challenges related to energy costs and the aging infrastructure of the plant.</p>

            <p>President Trump stated that he "got every answer right" on a cognitive test during his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He also mentioned that the exam showed a "good heart, a good soul, very good soul." The White House press secretary indicated that a report on the exam would be released soon, offering potential insights into Trump's health. The president's last detailed health report was in 2018, and he did not release medical details during the 2024 campaign.</p>
