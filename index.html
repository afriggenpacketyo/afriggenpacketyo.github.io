The funds are intended to fuel the company's global expansion and increase its production capacity, reflecting a broader trend of strong investor appetite for Chinese biotechnology firms. This move follows similar successful capital-raising efforts by other Chinese drug developers, buoyed by significant interest from mainland investors in Hong Kong's biotech sector. The capital will serve as a key driver for the company's sustained long-term growth initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats in Texas are strongly opposing a new congressional map proposed by Republicans, arguing it is a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" plan. Critics claim the map intentionally dilutes the voting power of minority communities, particularly Black and Latino populations, for partisan political advantage. The proposal aims to make several Democratic-held districts more favorable to the GOP, a move that some fear could violate the Voting Rights Act. The debate highlights the contentious nature of redistricting and its potential to significantly alter the state's political landscape.</p>

Indian officials state that protecting local farmers, a significant voting bloc, is a non-negotiable red line, especially concerning genetically modified foods and dairy. Analysts suggest the U.S. has strategic interests in not alienating India, viewing it as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China.

          <p>A jury has found Colorado dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, with a lethal cocktail of substances including arsenic and cyanide. Prosecutors argued the crime was driven by greed and betrayal, pointing to a struggling dental practice, $4 million in life insurance policies, and extramarital affairs. The investigation revealed Craig administered the poison in his wife's protein shakes over time. He was convicted on all charges and faces an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>A failure in the UK's air traffic control system, operated by NATS, led to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounded thousands more, prompting outrage from major airlines. The radar-related issue was resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, but the disruption continued into the next day. Airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet criticized NATS for the repeated failure, referencing a similar major outage in August 2023 and calling for improved system resilience. The government is now working with NATS to investigate the cause of the widespread travel chaos.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity shrank more than anticipated in July, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 49.3, marking the fourth straight month of contraction. The decline is attributed to factors like extreme weather, a traditional off-season, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for employment, new orders, and raw materials inventory also contracted, signaling broader economic weakness. The slowdown in both manufacturing and services sectors raises concerns about China's economic growth prospects for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk and costs, with a new runway operational by 2035 for under £25 billion. This marks the first time a competing bid for the long-debated expansion has been formally submitted to the government.</p>

          <p>The man responsible for a deadly vehicle attack on a German Christmas market has caused further distress to his victims by sending them personal letters from his jail cell. The perpetrator, who killed six and injured over 300 people, reportedly obtained the names and addresses of at least five survivors and mailed them handwritten letters asking for forgiveness. Recipients expressed shock and felt re-traumatized by the invasion of their privacy. Authorities are investigating how he accessed the information and are considering ways to prevent such direct contact in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's trade policies shows that the new tariffs are having a significant and varied impact on the U.S. economy and global trade flows. The average U.S. tariff rate has reached its highest level in nearly a century, boosting government revenue but also contributing to a widening trade deficit as firms stockpiled goods. While Chinese exports to the U.S. have fallen, some data suggests consumer prices for certain imported goods are beginning to rise, indicating the costs are starting to be passed on to Americans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining it in the 4.25% to 4.5% range despite pressure from President Donald Trump to implement cuts. The decision came amid mixed economic data, with GDP growth rebounding but underlying signs suggesting a loss of momentum. In an unusual move, two board members dissented, voting for a rate cut, which signals broadening support for looser monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated he sees little evidence that current rates are inappropriately holding back the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The indictment alleges the operation also involved hiring women to provide companionship to players and armed security. Arenas has pleaded not guilty to federal charges, including operating an illegal gambling business, and has been released on a $50,000 bond pending trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast highlights the science of tsunamis, which are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor. These events create long, powerful waves that travel at high speeds in deep water and grow in height as they approach the coast, becoming incredibly destructive. Experts emphasize that if you are at a beach and can see a tsunami, it is too late to outrun it. The safest course of action during a warning is to immediately move to higher ground, ideally at least 100 feet above sea level.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition has discovered and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of more than 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean, challenging previous assumptions about life in extreme environments. Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed vast beds of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, all thriving in total darkness and under immense pressure. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest such "chemosynthetic" ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions.</p>
