          <p>Public tours of the White House have been paused for approximately two months due to extensive construction on the East Wing. The demolition and subsequent rebuilding to create a new ballroom have made the traditional tour route inaccessible. A White House official indicated that they anticipate "positive news" regarding public events in the near future, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The White House Historical Association has documented the East Wing's historical elements for preservation before the demolition began.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. cattle ranchers "don't understand" the benefits of his tariffs and urged them to lower their prices for consumers. His comments follow criticism from ranching associations over a proposal to import beef from Argentina to reduce domestic prices. Trump asserted that his tariffs are the sole reason for the ranchers' recent success, a claim disputed by groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. The situation is complicated by the administration's broader financial support for Argentina, which has drawn criticism from other agricultural sectors.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a non-binding advisory opinion stating Israel has a legal obligation to allow UN humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip to meet the basic needs of Palestinian civilians. The UN's top court also found that Israel had not substantiated its allegations that a significant number of staff at the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) were members of armed groups. While the UN Secretary-General welcomed the decision, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as "political" and reiterated it would not cooperate with UNRWA.</p>

          <p>Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley delivered an overnight marathon speech on the Senate floor, lasting over 20 hours, to protest the policies of the Trump administration. He criticized actions such as deportation efforts, the cancellation of federal programs, and the potential deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland. Merkley described the moment as the "biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War," asserting that the President is "shredding our Constitution." The lengthy address is one of the longest in recent Senate history and occurred amid a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli is campaigning with Florida Representative Byron Donalds, a prominent ally of President Trump, as he seeks to close the polling gap with his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikee Sherrill. With early voting approaching, Ciattarelli is focusing on energizing the Republican base, expressing confidence that high turnout will lead to victory. The appearance of Donalds and other national conservative figures is part of a strategy to mobilize Trump voters who may not typically vote in state elections. Democrats have criticized Ciattarelli for aligning with what they term the "furthest MAGA fringes."</p>

          <p>A growing trend in the tech industry sees artificial intelligence startups laying off significant portions of their staff shortly after being acquired by or receiving large investments from major companies like Meta and Accenture. This pattern signals a shift where big tech firms are prioritizing the rapid integration of AI technology and eliminating redundant roles over preserving the startup's original culture and workforce. Analysts suggest this "buy and liquidate the staff" approach is driven by an employer-favored labor market and a focus on creating flatter, more efficient organizational structures. This trend is creating job uncertainty for workers in the booming but volatile AI sector.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, consumers with high credit card debt face a strategic decision. While lower Fed rates could eventually lead to reduced credit card APRs, the relief is unlikely to be immediate or substantial, as these cuts are typically incremental and don't directly correlate with credit card rates. The article suggests that waiting for these minor changes may be less effective than pursuing immediate debt relief options like forgiveness or consolidation programs, especially as interest continues to compound at high rates. Borrowers are advised to consider that proactive measures might offer more significant financial benefits than passively waiting for macroeconomic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that California voters' positions on Proposition 50, a state ballot measure concerning redistricting, are heavily influenced by national politics. A majority of those supporting the measure cite opposition to the Trump administration and national Republicans as a key reason for their vote. Conversely, opponents tend to view it as a state-level issue, expressing concerns about shifting power to urban areas and the financial cost. The poll also indicates a widespread feeling among Californians that the Trump administration treats their state worse than others, a sentiment that is helping to drive support for the "yes" campaign.</p>

          <p>A master jeweler and gem appraiser suggests that the thieves who stole approximately $102 million worth of royal jewels from the Louvre will struggle to profit from the heist. According to expert Stephen Portier, the pieces are too famous to be sold intact, and dismantling them would reduce their value by as much as 90%. The unique characteristics of the centuries-old stones, including their distinctive cut and specific properties, would make them identifiable even if removed from their settings. This raises questions about the thieves' motives, given the high risk of the crime versus the likely diminished financial return.</p>

Locking a rate now provides certainty for budgeting and protects against unforeseen market spikes, but risks missing out on lower rates if the Fed acts as anticipated. Conversely, waiting could lead to savings, though there's no guarantee that Fed cuts will translate into significantly lower mortgage rates, and lenders may charge fees to "float down" to a new, lower rate later.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, the process involves specific rules that differ from those for single borrowers. Both spouses must typically be at least 62 years old and be listed as co-borrowers to ensure both can remain in the home for life. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which may result in access to less equity than if based on the older spouse's age. The article advises couples to carefully weigh the benefits, like eliminating mortgage payments, against long-term implications, such as what happens if one spouse passes away.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's claims that the government shutdown primarily harms his political opponents, its effects are increasingly being felt by his own supporters. Key constituencies like farmers are facing disruptions to federal aid programs, and furloughs have impacted small-business lending in rural areas. While the administration has taken steps to shield some groups, such as the military, from the shutdown's immediate consequences, the prolonged funding lapse is creating collateral damage that cannot be neatly divided along partisan lines. The growing economic pain for voters in Republican-leaning states is increasing pressure on the administration and lawmakers to find a resolution.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent remarks suggesting that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security could be "gone" have generated significant public alarm and criticism. During a press conference about the government shutdown, he claimed that Democratic policies would bankrupt the country, leading to the loss of these essential programs. The comments were quickly interpreted by many as a threat to cut the popular entitlement programs, which millions of Americans, including seniors and disabled individuals, rely on. The statement has intensified the political debate surrounding the government shutdown, with opponents accusing the president of threatening the financial and medical security of vulnerable citizens.</p>

According to a memo from Meta's Chief AI Officer, the reduction in team size is intended to make each remaining employee "more load-bearing" with greater impact.

          <p>The viral "Group 7" trend on TikTok was created by Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter Sophia James as an experiment to "bully the algorithm" into promoting her new single. James posted a series of seven videos, each assigning viewers to a different group, to see which one would gain the most traction. The "Group 7" video, in which she simply welcomes viewers to the group, exploded in popularity, attracting millions of likes and participation from celebrities and brands. Experts explain its success by noting how it gamified the user experience, creating a sense of an exclusive club and leveraging TikTok's participatory nature.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called for Prince Andrew to be questioned by a parliamentary committee regarding the terms of his lease on Royal Lodge in Windsor. The request for an inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee follows public scrutiny over the deal with the Crown Estate, which reportedly involves minimal annual rent in exchange for large upfront payments. Davey argued that the public deserves to know if this is an appropriate arrangement for a Crown Estate property. While a committee could invite the prince, an appearance by a royal family member in such a setting would be unprecedented.</p>

For years, the Kremlin has used state-funded foundations to promote Russian language and culture abroad, sanitize its international image, and undermine democratic values in former Soviet states. The creation of a centralized agency suggests a more coordinated effort to fill the void left by a retreating United States on the global stage.</p>
