          <p>Sinclair Broadcast Group has announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to its ABC stations, ending a preemption of the late-night program. The decision to pull the show was made in response to comments from host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the shooting death of a conservative activist. In a statement, Sinclair explained its goal was to ensure programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience. The show resumed its normal broadcast schedule following the announcement, resolving the brief but notable programming dispute.</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people at the NFL's headquarters before taking his own life, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). This finding aligns with a note found on Tamura, in which he blamed the NFL for concealing brain injury risks and requested his brain be studied. The medical examiner's report diagnosed low-stage CTE but did not state whether the condition played a role in his actions. The NFL expressed condolences while noting that the science around CTE is still evolving.</p>

          <p>As influenza season approaches, health officials recommend September and October as the ideal months for most people to receive their flu vaccine. According to the CDC, this timing allows the body approximately two weeks to develop protective antibodies before the virus typically peaks. While vaccination should ideally be completed by the end of October, certain groups, like young children needing two doses or pregnant individuals in their third trimester, may have different scheduling needs. The guidance aims to maximize the vaccine's effectiveness throughout the flu season.</p>

          <p>Howard Rubin, a prominent former bond trader, has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts. The indictment alleges that Rubin, with the help of his former assistant, operated a trafficking network for a decade, spending over $1 million. Prosecutors claim he brutalized women in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse, often engaging in acts beyond their consent that resulted in significant pain and injury. Rubin was previously found liable for sex trafficking in a civil case and ordered to pay millions in damages.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has restored the party whip to former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum, ending their year-long suspension. They were among a group of left-wing MPs who defied party leadership by voting with the SNP to scrap the two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. This move follows the readmission of four other suspended MPs earlier this year and signals a potential softening of the party's stance on the controversial welfare policy. The issue is expected to be a prominent topic at the upcoming Labour Party conference.</p>

          <p>In recognition of LGBTQ+ History Month and National Coming Out Day on October 11, National Public Radio is asking individuals to share their personal coming out stories. The initiative aims to celebrate the courage involved in living authentically and to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ rights. NPR plans to feature some of the submitted stories, photos, or voice memos in its "Up First" newsletter. This project highlights the personal significance of coming out, which is framed as a process of inviting others into one's life rather than seeking permission.</p>

          <h2>Guide Explains Consequences and Timeline of Late Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:17:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card delinquencies, understanding the timeline for late payments is crucial for consumers to mitigate financial damage. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major consequence occurs at 30 days past due, when the delinquency is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging credit scores. Consequences escalate further at 60 and 90 days, potentially leading to penalty interest rates and more aggressive collection efforts, underscoring the importance of proactive communication with lenders.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that using charges of hypocrisy is an ineffective and evasive tactic in debates about free speech and "cancel culture." The author contends that pointing out an opponent's hypocrisy serves only to judge the person, not the validity of their ideas or the principles at stake. The piece notes that illiberalism exists on both the political left and right, with each side often accusing the other of the same censorious behavior to justify their own actions. The author concludes that a principled defense of liberal norms is more important than focusing on who is being hypocritical.</p>

          <p>Spectators attending the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black experienced significant delays and missed the initial action due to stringent security measures implemented for Donald Trump's visit. Despite organizers opening gates hours earlier than usual, airport-style security checks led to long queues and heavy congestion around the venue. This marked the first time a sitting U.S. president has attended the golf tournament. While the event proceeded without adjustments to tee times, many fans who paid high ticket prices expressed frustration over the disruptions caused by the extensive security operation.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent figure in the Black Liberation Army, has died in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78. Born JoAnne Chesimard, she became a symbol of Black resistance after being convicted in 1977 of murdering a New Jersey state trooper, a charge she always denied. In 1979, she escaped from a U.S. prison and was later granted political asylum in Cuba, where she lived for decades. Shakur's life was marked by her activism with groups like the Black Panther Party and her status as a fugitive, which led the FBI to place her on its Most Wanted Terrorist list.</p>

This authority was revoked in 2019 and 2022, respectively, following fatal crashes and production defects that placed the company under intense regulatory scrutiny. The FAA stated the decision reflects confidence in Boeing's improved production quality and will allow federal inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance.

Critics, including fellow comedians like Marc Maron and human rights organizations, argue that participating in the event helps the Saudi government "whitewash" its record of human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The festival is part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan to enhance its global image and diversify its economy.

After the incident, Elliott immediately called 911, claiming he thought he was in a dream and had been sleepwalking. His defense is built on this claim, supported by a family history of sleepwalking and the findings of a sleep disorder expert who studied him. Prosecutors remain skeptical, pointing to the nature of the wounds and Elliott's demeanor after the event, leaving a jury to decide whether the act was an intentional murder or a tragic, unconscious accident.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for home equity loans have decreased, making them a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For example, a $150,000 loan with a 10-year term now has an average monthly payment of about $1,847, which is slightly lower than costs seen earlier in the year. While the savings are modest on a monthly basis, they can accumulate to over a thousand dollars over the life of the loan.

The summons comes after Hegseth previously announced plans to review and potentially reduce the number of high-ranking general and flag officer positions within the armed forces, though it is unclear if that is the focus of this meeting.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman has argued for the need for decisive interest rate cuts to counteract growing fragility in the U.S. labor market. In a recent speech, Bowman stated that recent data indicates a deteriorating job market and that the Federal Open Market Committee risks being "behind the curve" if it does not act proactively. She suggested that while inflation remains a concern, the focus should shift to the part of the Fed's dual mandate that is showing signs of weakness. Her comments signal a strong dovish stance within the central bank's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional retirement withdrawal methods. The rule suggests converting one-third of one's retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and unexpected costs. This approach aims to balance financial security with flexibility, providing a stable income floor while allowing for market participation, potentially reducing stress during volatile periods for retirees.

          <p>In this opinion piece, a veteran Pentagon correspondent criticizes the Defense Department's new accreditation rules for journalists, arguing they severely limit news-gathering and threaten transparency. The new 17-page agreement appears to prohibit the publication of any unapproved information, with the potential penalty of having credentials revoked. The author argues that this move breaks with decades of precedent, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, where press access was seen as an obligation to the American public. The piece contends that restricting the press makes leaders look weak and ultimately harms the public's right to know about its military.</p>
