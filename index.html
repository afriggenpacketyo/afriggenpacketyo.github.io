          <p>Police officers who were first to arrive at the scene of the deadly stabbing in Southport have shared their harrowing experiences. Sgt Greg Gillespie and PC Luke Holden made the decision to enter the dance studio without waiting for armed backup, knowing only that a child had been stabbed and the attacker was inside. They came face-to-face with the blood-stained teenage killer, whom they described as a coward. The attack claimed the lives of three young girls and injured many others, leaving an indelible mark on the officers who have since been recognized for their bravery in confronting the unimaginable horror.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina are facing significant challenges, including mass layoffs and funding cuts, under the new administration of President Javier Milei. The cuts have severely impacted institutions housed at the former ESMA detention center, now a UNESCO World Heritage site and museum. Key agencies like the National Archive of Remembrance, which documents crimes of the military dictatorship, and groups like Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, which identifies children stolen during that era, have seen their staff and resources drastically reduced. This shift threatens the decades-long work of memory, truth, and justice for the victims of the regime's atrocities.</p>

          <p>A profile of comedian John Oliver explores his evolution from a Cambridge student performing at the Edinburgh Fringe festival to one of America's most influential political satirists on his HBO show "Last Week Tonight." The article details his meticulous, research-intensive process, which combines comedy with deep dives into complex, often obscure, systemic problems. Oliver, now a US citizen, views his critical commentary not as an attack on his adopted homeland but as an expression of love and a desire for improvement. His team of journalists and writers helps him craft the show's signature segments, which have earned numerous awards for their unique blend of humor and investigative rigor.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the profound story of Mariana Eva Pérez and her brother, Guillermo Pérez Roisinblit, who was stolen as a baby during Argentina's military dictatorship. Their mother, Patricia, was murdered after giving birth in a detention camp, and Guillermo was raised by a military family. The siblings were reunited after an anonymous tip led Mariana to him, with a DNA test confirming their relationship. The story explores Guillermo's difficult journey of rebuilding his identity, the complex family dynamics that ensued, and their separate paths to processing a shared trauma. Their experience highlights the lasting, painful legacy of the dictatorship's systematic crimes against humanity.</p>

          <p>An investigative journalist and a documentary photographer successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's former military dictatorship for "death flights." During the regime, political prisoners were drugged and thrown from this plane into the Atlantic Ocean. The investigation, which began with a search for the physical aircraft, uncovered crucial flight logs that provided the first documented proof of these atrocities and linked specific pilots to the disappearance of a group of mothers and nuns in 1977. The plane was eventually found in the U.S., purchased by the Argentine government, and returned to be displayed as irrefutable evidence at the ESMA Museum and Memorial in Buenos Aires.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material as part of an investigation dubbed "Operation Grayskull."

Among those convicted was William Spearman, described as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material, who received a life sentence.

Renowned for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs in the 1950s and 60s, Lehrer's work often tackled controversial subjects with witty, macabre lyrics. His notable songs include "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park," "The Masochism Tango," and "The Elements," a rapid-fire listing of the periodic table. After a successful but relatively brief performing career, he taught mathematics and musical theatre at the University of California and, in 2020, placed all of his song copyrights into the public domain for anyone to use freely.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area has a unique opportunity to become a global model for sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already implementing smart infrastructure and climate innovations, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system. To capitalize on this, the region should create a low-carbon tourism corridor that links its cities through clean and smart travel options. The author suggests that building this green tourism economy requires not just new hardware but also integrated systems and partnerships that align with the priorities of modern, environmentally conscious travelers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to meet with US President Donald Trump in Scotland, with transatlantic trade and the conflict in Gaza expected to be the main topics of discussion. Starmer will likely press for further reductions in US tariffs following a recent trade deal, while also navigating a delicate diplomatic line on the Middle East. The UK is working with European allies on a post-ceasefire plan for Gaza, a position that differs from the US stance. This meeting underscores the complex relationship between the UK, its European partners, and the Trump administration on key foreign policy and economic issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union is being framed as a victory for both sides, though the full details remain critical. For the EU, the 15% tariff is a better outcome than the threatened 30%, while the US secures an estimated $90 billion in tariff revenue and a commitment for $600 billion in EU investment. The deal, brokered personally by President Trump, highlights his strategy of renegotiating global trade relationships. Analysts note that this success could provide momentum for upcoming US trade negotiations with China, although Beijing has historically taken a more uncompromising stance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered an inconsistent performance in a 4-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox, fueling speculation as the MLB trade deadline approaches. May, who is in his final year before free agency, allowed four runs over five innings, undone by a three-run fifth after cruising through the middle of the game. With the Dodgers needing to make room in their rotation for a returning player, May's name has surfaced in trade rumors.

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed aid airdrops into Gaza after Israel announced a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in some areas to allow humanitarian convoys. The World Health Organization has warned that malnutrition in the Strip has reached "alarming levels" and is on a "dangerous trajectory," with a third of the population not eating for days at a time. Despite the pause, medics reported that Israeli fire killed nine people near an aid route. The new measures are intended to address intense international pressure on Israel over the starvation crisis, though aid organizations stress that land routes are the only truly sustainable solution.</p>

          <p>This sports analysis focuses on England cricket captain Ben Stokes, who has been visibly struggling with physical niggles while continuing to bowl. The author argues that it is past the point where coaches or teammates can tell Stokes to stop; he must realize the importance of self-preservation for the team's long-term success. Stokes's critical importance is highlighted by his superior bowling performance, especially with the old ball, compared to the rest of the attack. With a crucial series finale and an Ashes tour on the horizon, England's chances are seen as heavily dependent on a fit and available Stokes.</p>
