          <h2>Immunotherapy Drug Shows Promise in Eliminating Tumors in Early-Stage Cancers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 20:54:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab has shown remarkable success in eliminating tumors in some patients with early-stage cancers, potentially allowing them to avoid surgery. In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer needed an operation, and two years later, 92% remained cancer-free. The study focused on patients with tumors having a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic problem that makes them more likely to respond to immunotherapy, and researchers are optimistic about expanding the therapy's use to more cancer types in the future.</p>

          <p>A widespread power outage struck Spain and Portugal, causing significant disruptions to transportation, communication, and daily life for millions of people.

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has experienced a mass exodus of "over 100" attorneys following the appointment of Harmeet Dhillon, who has signaled a shift in the division's priorities under President Trump. The resignations come as the DOJ has indicated it will focus less on voting rights and policing issues, and more on culture war topics, prompting concerns about the politicization of the division and its ability to enforce federal civil rights laws.</p>

          <p>CBS News is facing allegations that its parent company, Paramount, is censoring its coverage to appease the Trump administration, raising concerns about editorial independence and freedom of the press. Scott Pelley suggested that Paramount's increased scrutiny of 60 Minutes' content, including stories about the Trump administration, is linked to the company's desire for FCC approval of its merger with Skydance Media. The concerns arise after Trump criticized CBS for a 60 Minutes episode and is suing the network, adding pressure on Paramount to maintain a favorable relationship with the administration.</p>
