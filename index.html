          <p>The June CNBC Fed Survey reveals that respondents anticipate weaker economic growth and higher inflation compared to earlier forecasts, with 71% expressing uncertainty about trade policy. Despite a decrease in the probability of a recession to 38%, GDP growth is projected to be only 1.13%. While 54% of respondents expect a new trade deal with China within five months, concerns remain about tariffs causing sustained inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current rates at the June meeting and implement two rate cuts later in the year, with a potential funds rate of 3.9% by year-end.

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making break-even operating margins this year unlikely, according to CEO Joanna Geraghty. The airline will reduce off-peak flights, cut unprofitable routes, and postpone plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets. JetBlue is also reassessing hiring plans and may combine leadership roles and reduce travel spending. These measures are being taken as the carrier relies on borrowed cash to maintain operations.</p>

          <p>Iran has two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, one at Natanz and another at Fordo, the latter being of greater concern to international monitors. Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is suspected of concealing clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons. While Israel attacked Natanz, it has not yet struck Fordo. Experts suggest that Fordo's fortified location and advanced machinery make it a significant concern for nuclear weapons proliferation. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts, raising further concerns about the facility.</p>
