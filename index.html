          <h2>NATO Allies Commit to Increased Defense Spending Amidst Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>NATO allies have pledged to increase defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, as the U.S. pushes for greater contributions amid global instability. However, some member states, like Spain, are hesitant to meet the full target, raising concerns about the actual implementation of these commitments. The U.S., under President Trump, seeks concrete action and clear plans from its allies, while European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for long-term government contracts to scale up production. The leaders of Leonardo, Embraer and Saab told CNBC last week the continent needs to act decisively and collectively to make long-term commitments to defense spending and investment contracts to enable companies like theirs to scale-up their production capacity and manufacturing capabilities. This article highlights the challenges and expectations surrounding defense spending within the alliance. Optimism remains cautiously optimistic given the geopolitical climate. </p>

          <p>Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), has significantly influenced immigration policy in Washington D.C. for the recent decade, pushing for restrictive measures such as ending birthright citizenship and increasing deportations. Stein argues that illegal immigration burdens taxpayers, threatens safety, and harms the environment, advocating for policies once considered fringe. Despite criticism from civil rights groups, Stein's ideas have gained traction, with former staffers now holding influential positions in government. The article highlights Stein's satisfaction with Trump's immigration crackdown and his continued support for stricter restrictions, as he believes the government should consider what the newcomers can offer American society before being granted a visa or a pathway to citizenship. The Southern Poverty Law Center considers FAIR to be an anti-immigrant hate group. </p>

Democrats criticize the action as unconstitutional, while Republicans largely support it, suggesting a dangerous trajectory towards authoritarianism.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed rule changes to the civil service aim to increase accountability and responsiveness but are criticized for potentially politicizing federal jobs. The rule would allow the administration to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants as at-will employees, reducing their job protections. Critics warn that this could lead to political interference and a loss of expertise in government agencies, affecting the quality and reliability of public services. The administration says it is meant to ensure that the president has people who are working for him that are actually going to do the policies that he ran on, that he's articulating, and that making it easier to fire people is in fact a stated goal. </p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available through GPs in England for eligible patients who meet very strict criteria, which includes a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background) and four out of five specific health conditions. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to manage resources and GP workload, with plans to expand availability in phases over the next few years. Patients will also receive wrap-around care, including regular check-ups and support with exercise and healthy eating. GPs are urging people not to approach their local surgery unless they are eligible, as many practices may not have the capacity to meet the demand. </p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that the U.S. strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities caused "monumental damage," with satellite images showing "obliteration" of the sites. He emphasized that the biggest damage took place far below ground level, with the strikes targeting deeply embedded structures. The strikes involved multiple B-2 bombers and precision-guided weapons, with officials emphasizing that the attack targeted Iran's nuclear program, not its military or people. This article focuses on Trump's claims regarding the effectiveness of the strikes. </p>

The company's commitment to Asia is for the long haul, aiming to maximize profits and minimize losses, regardless of short-term disruptions. Even amid trade and geopolitical tensions like the escalating Iran-Israel conflict, trade volume would not slow down, as the countryâ€™s economy and projects would keep pushing ahead. </p>

While the Met has imposed conditions on the protest to prevent disorder, they lack the legal power to prevent it until the group is proscribed.

The article notes that Russia, while an ally of Tehran, is balancing its relationship with Iran and its desire to re-establish ties with the Trump administration. Putin has repeatedly offered to mediate between the United States and Iran, and said that he had conveyed Moscow's ideas on resolving the conflict to them while ensuring Iran's continued access to civil nuclear energy. </p>

Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, characterized President Trump's strikes on Iran as a "massive gamble," citing historical parallels with past U.S. military interventions in the Middle East.

He cautioned against premature optimism and highlighted the potential for a worst-case scenario, including increased regional instability and the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons. He noted that it is too soon to call the attacks on Iranâ€™s nuclear facilities a success and cautioned against applauding them. </p>

Closing the strait could alienate neighbors, provoke hostilities, and damage trade relations, particularly with China. While the closure could impact global energy prices, analysts believe Iran is unlikely to take such drastic action, as it would harm its own interests and invite a strong response. This article suggests that closing the waterway would provoke Iran's market in Asia, particularly China, which accounts for a majority of Iranian oil exports. </p>
