          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she was asleep. Immediately after the incident, Elliott called 911, claiming he believed he was in a dream and was sleepwalking. The case presents a profound mystery for investigators and prosecutors, as there is no evidence of motive or prior conflict between the exceptionally close siblings. A sleep disorder expert who studied Elliott supports the sleepwalking defense, citing family history and clinical observations, though prosecutors remain skeptical and are proceeding with the murder charge.</p>

Major asset managers like BlackRock are entering this space, signaling growing market interest in these hybrid investment products. While these new funds are still small compared to traditional gold and bitcoin ETFs, their emergence reflects a broader shift in how investors approach portfolio construction.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly was marked by a walkout from many delegates as he began to speak. In his address, which was broadcast towards Gaza, he vowed to "finish the job" against Hamas and directly addressed Israeli hostages. The speech comes amid heightened international criticism of Israel's military actions and growing diplomatic isolation, with several world leaders condemning the campaign. Netanyahu is also facing protests in New York from families of hostages who are urging for their release to be prioritized.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" program, offering U.S. residency for a $1 million fee, a significant price reduction from the initially proposed $5 million. This move has made the visa highly competitive in the global market, attracting immediate interest from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India, according to immigration attorneys. However, the program faces potential legal challenges and logistical hurdles, including how it will navigate existing backlogs for applicants from certain countries. Despite the uncertainties, the program is expected to generate substantial federal revenue and appeal to global elites seeking a "Plan B" residency.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, North Carolina, the city's hospitality industry is pinning its hopes on a strong fall tourist season for economic recovery. The storm caused widespread flooding, infrastructure damage, and power outages, bringing tourism to a standstill and resulting in significant financial losses for small businesses. Many establishments, having accrued substantial debt to reopen, are now heavily dependent on the influx of autumn visitors to stay afloat through the winter.

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a significant surge after President Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported heavy-duty trucks. The tariffs are intended to protect domestic manufacturers from foreign competition, a move Trump stated would shield companies like Paccar. According to analysts at Bank of America, this policy directly addresses the price disadvantage Paccar faces against competitors manufacturing in Mexico. The tariffs are seen as placing the U.S.-based truck maker in a more advantageous market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making a false statement to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The indictment stems from his 2020 testimony regarding the Russia investigation, specifically whether he authorized leaks to the media. This development is seen as a major escalation in President Donald Trump's campaign to prosecute political adversaries, coming shortly after he publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action. Comey has declared his innocence, and the move has drawn sharp criticism from legal experts and Democratic leaders as a politically motivated "abuse of power."</p>

Without a trademark, an entrepreneur risks being sued by others who may have a similar brand, even if the side business is only generating a small income.

          <p>While interest rates for credit cards and auto loans are beginning to ease, 30-year fixed mortgage rates remain stubbornly high, hovering above 6%. This divergence is because mortgage rates are more closely tied to the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, not the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate. The gap, or "spread," between Treasury yields and mortgage rates is currently wider than historical norms. Economists attribute this to persistent inflation concerns and the Federal Reserve's reduced purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, which has increased the risk premium demanded by private investors.

The new scheme will be required for anyone to prove their right to work in the UK, making it more difficult for individuals without legal status to find employment. While the ID will be optional for non-workers, the government also highlighted its potential benefits for citizens, such as streamlining access to services. The plan has drawn criticism from opposition parties who question its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to roll out a digital ID system, which will be compulsory for anyone seeking employment. Stored as an app on a smartphone, the ID will contain a person's photo, name, date of birth, and residency status to verify their right to work. The government's primary goal is to curb illegal employment, a key factor believed to attract illegal migration. While mandatory for work, the digital ID will be optional for students, retirees, and others, and there will be no requirement to carry it in public, distinguishing it from a traditional national identity card.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent visit to Xinjiang to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its designation as an autonomous region has been criticized by human rights advocates as a propaganda effort. The state-media-broadcast festivities, featuring singing and dancing, stand in stark contrast to the reality of mass detention, forced labor, and intense surveillance imposed on the Uyghur population. During his visit, Xi called for "social stability" and praised the Communist Party's ethnic policies. However, experts note that the region remains under a pervasive high-tech surveillance system, and the cultural erasure of ethnic minorities continues despite the curated public image.</p>

          <p>The number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody has reached at least 16 since January, raising serious concerns among lawmakers and advocacy groups about the conditions within detention facilities. This marks a significant increase in the rate of detainee deaths compared to the previous administration. The rising death toll coincides with a record-high number of people being held in ICE detention, which now exceeds 59,000. In response to the fatalities, immigrant rights organizations are highlighting what they describe as "horrendous conditions," while ICE maintains its commitment to providing comprehensive medical care and humane environments.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has publicly stated his openness to another round of discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing the "good memories" and personal bond they formed during Trump's first term. This overture comes as North Korea has become more emboldened, advancing its weapons programs and strengthening ties with Russia and China. However, Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear status is non-negotiable and that any talks are contingent on Washington abandoning its goal of denuclearization. The U.S. State Department has maintained its commitment to that goal, leaving the prospects for a meaningful summit uncertain.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has suspended its recently announced controls on semiconductor exports to South Africa, backtracking on a measure intended to pressure Pretoria in a diplomatic dispute. The curbs were introduced after South Africa demanded that Taiwan's representative office in the country be relocated or downgraded. Following the announcement of the chip controls, the South African government agreed to suspend its demand and enter into further discussions with Taipei. The now-paused controls would have required prior approval for the shipment of 47 different semiconductor products, including wafers and memory chips.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that fewer than one-third of American teenagers suffering from opioid use disorder receive any form of treatment, a critical gap in care as overdose deaths among youth are rapidly increasing. Between 2018 and 2023, teen opioid overdose deaths nearly tripled, a rate of increase far exceeding that of adults, partly due to the prevalence of counterfeit pills containing fentanyl. Experts point to a severe lack of available treatment options for adolescents, especially medication-assisted treatments like buprenorphine, which are considered the most effective but are prescribed to less than 10% of teens in treatment.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that American public relations and marketing firms are actively helping Israel rebrand its military campaign in Gaza to obscure what many human rights organizations have labeled a genocide. The article highlights the work of firms like Stagwell Global, which was reportedly commissioned to rehabilitate Israel's image by stoking fears of "Radical Islam." The author contends that this "flooding the zone" with pro-Israel messaging, combined with restricted press access to Gaza, aims to create uncertainty and fatigue among the public. This propaganda effort, supported by significant financial investment and influential media figures, systematically works to contest reality and downplay the humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>For the first time under the second Trump administration, government data shows that immigrants with no criminal record are the largest single group held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. Of the nearly 60,000 people currently detained, over 16,500 arrested by ICE have no criminal history, surpassing the number of those with convictions or pending charges. This trend contradicts the administration's narrative of focusing enforcement on dangerous criminals and reflects a surge in so-called "collateral arrests." The shift highlights a broader enforcement strategy targeting a wider range of undocumented immigrants, many of whom have long-standing ties to the U.S.</p>

The probes, one an anti-dumping investigation into pecans and the other into potential trade barriers, follow Mexico's plans to impose duties on a range of goods that notably spare the US and Canada. Experts suggest Beijing is flexing its economic muscle to signal that it will not tolerate actions it perceives as being taken under pressure from Washington.

Despite these fundamental disagreements, which have required setting rules like "no talking politics," she finds that their relationship endures. The author concludes that shared humor and mutual acts of kindness and support for each other's families are the foundation that sustains their bond.

          <p>Understanding how a financial advisor is compensated is crucial for investors, as fee structures can vary widely and impact returns. Advisors are typically paid through either commissions for selling products or various fee-based models, such as a percentage of assets under management (AUM), a flat annual fee, or an hourly rate. Each model has its own pros, cons, and potential conflicts of interest that consumers should be aware of. Experts recommend that clients directly ask advisors how they are paid and what services are included to ensure transparency and align the advisor's incentives with their own financial goals.
