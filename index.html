          <p>The Indian government has approved Apple supplier Foxconn's $433 million joint venture with HCL Group to construct a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, aiming to boost India's chip manufacturing industry. Expected to be operational by 2027, the facility will produce display driver chips for mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and PCs, with a capacity of 20,000 wafers and 36 million chips per month. This deal aligns with Apple suppliers' increasing shift towards India amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and supports India's "Semiconductor Mission" to establish a robust chip ecosystem.

          <p>Three Māori MPs in New Zealand face potential suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a parliamentary session last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers, leading to recommendations for suspension. The Māori Party criticized the recommendations as a "warning shot to all of us to fall in line," while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters condemned the MPs' behavior. The proposed suspensions will be put to a vote. The optimism score here is 50.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy has experienced a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects growth to moderate in the coming years.
