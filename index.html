          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to expand expedited removals across the entire country, citing significant due process concerns for migrants. The ruling pauses a directive that allowed immigration officials to deport certain non-citizens without a judicial hearing, a policy previously limited to border areas and recent arrivals. Judge Jia Cobb's decision emphasizes that while the expedited removal statute itself is not being questioned, its application to a much broader population living within the U.S. interior requires proper legal procedures to be followed.</p>

This victory marks Norrie's seventh consecutive loss to Djokovic and ends British singles participation in the tournament.

Decker is accused of murdering his three young daughters, Paityn, Evelyn, and Olivia, whose bodies were found in his truck in June. The recovered bones are currently being analyzed to determine if they are human or animal. The extensive search, involving nearly 100 personnel, also yielded other "potential evidence" that is being examined for links to the case.</p>

The trio beat the previous record of 162 days while raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.

          <p>Randy “Duke” Cunningham, a highly decorated Navy flying ace from the Vietnam War who later served eight terms in Congress, has died at the age of 83. His celebrated military career, which earned him a Navy Cross and two Silver Stars, was overshadowed by his political downfall. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to accepting $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors, leading to the longest prison sentence ever served by a congressman for such crimes at the time. Cunningham, who was pardoned by Donald Trump in 2021, expressed shame upon his resignation but later claimed regret over his guilty plea.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile section of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to significant storm and fire damage. The scenic route, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was damaged by severe weather in 2022 and 2023, followed by the Bridge fire in 2024. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. While the reopening is celebrated by the hiking community, it coincides with heightened fire danger warnings for the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Essex Police arrested three men on suspicion of violent disorder, assaulting an officer, and drink driving during protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping. The demonstration followed a Court of Appeal decision to overturn an injunction, allowing 138 asylum seekers to remain at the hotel. Tensions in the town have been high since an asylum seeker was charged with the sexual assault of a teenage girl, leading to ongoing protests and 28 arrests to date. The local council is considering a further appeal to the Supreme Court, while community opinions on the situation remain deeply divided.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal law, dealing a significant blow to his trade strategy. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs, which it described as a core congressional power. The ruling applies to broad tariffs imposed on numerous countries and specific duties on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. While the decision will not immediately block the tariffs, the administration has vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

Florida has already executed more people in 2025 than any other state, contributing to a national increase in executions. Jones was sentenced to death in 1993 for the murders of Matilda and Jacob Nestor, and his legal team is expected to file appeals with both the state and U.S. Supreme Courts.</p>

The wall is being built by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has besieged the city for over a year. Analysts suggest the barrier is intended to trap civilians and create a "kill box" to defeat the Sudanese army, which holds the city as its last major stronghold in Darfur. The construction deepens the humanitarian crisis, restricting escape routes and access for aid, as the RSF is accused of intensifying attacks on civilian areas.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom's office confirmed that arrangements are being made to ensure Harris's safety, criticizing the move as politically vindictive. The decision comes as Harris is about to embark on a 15-stop book tour, raising concerns about her security.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has pushed back against President Trump's criticism of crime in Democratic-led states by pointing to the higher crime rates in Republican-led states like Louisiana, represented by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Newsom argued that if Trump is concerned about crime, he should look at the facts, noting Louisiana's murder rate is nearly four times higher than California's. When asked about this, Speaker Johnson gave an awkward response on Fox News, acknowledging crime is a problem everywhere and stating his hometown has done a "great job of reducing crime – gradually."</p>

          <p>The White House is standing by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. following a week of chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that has prompted calls for his resignation. The turmoil began with the firing of CDC Chief Dr. Susan Monarez, followed by the resignation of at least three senior leaders frustrated with Kennedy's leadership and vaccine policies. Despite criticism from Democrats and some Republicans over his anti-vaccine history, a White House official called Kennedy a "crown jewel" of the administration, tasked with restoring the CDC's integrity.</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. The proposed new map is designed to give Republicans a partisan advantage by targeting the Kansas City-area district currently held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. This move makes Missouri the third state to pursue a rare mid-decade redistricting, following similar efforts by Republicans in Texas and a counter-move by Democrats in California. Democrats have condemned the action as an attempt to gerrymander and silence voters' voices.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed it has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and approximately 80 other Palestinian officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to their efforts to undermine peace and seek unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. The move is highly unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. The Palestinian Authority condemned the decision as a violation of international law, while Israel welcomed it.</p>

          <p>Coffee giants like Costa are reportedly struggling as younger generations, the "matcha generation," increasingly favor trendier, visually appealing, and perceived healthier drinks from chains like Blank Street Coffee. This shift is driven by social media trends on platforms like TikTok, a desire for "affordable treats," and a preference for supporting smaller, artisanal businesses over large corporations. As home coffee machines become more popular, chains must offer unique experiences to attract customers. This changing consumer landscape presents a significant challenge for established brands in the competitive coffee market.</p>

While trust remains a major issue and reconciliation with his brother seems unlikely, this visit is seen as the best chance for a breakthrough between father and son.</p>

Parents and gymnasts at Chow's also reported inappropriate touching and behavior, but Qiao allegedly dismissed their concerns. The U.S. Center for SafeSport confirmed it sanctioned Qiao and other coaches for failing to report the misconduct allegations.</p>
