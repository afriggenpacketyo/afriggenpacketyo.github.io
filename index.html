          <p>California, despite becoming the world's fourth-largest economy, faces a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges. The state grapples with a potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies, while Los Angeles confronts a $1 billion budget shortfall and recovery from devastating fires. The article highlights the state's struggle with homelessness and economic strain on residents, compounded by an adversarial relationship with the federal government. Despite these difficulties, some leaders remain optimistic, citing California's history of resilience and wealth as factors that will allow it to adjust, though many people are expected to be hurt in the process.</p>

          <p>Hamas has declared its intention to release Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage, as part of ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The 21-year-old soldier, captured during the October 7 attack, is the last known living US hostage held in the territory. This announcement follows reports of direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official in Qatar, focusing on a truce and humanitarian aid. The Israeli Prime Minister's office has been informed by the US of Hamas's gesture, anticipating further hostage negotiations, although Israel maintains its commitment to achieving all war objectives. The release is intended as a goodwill gesture before President Trump's arrival in the Middle East.</p>

This initiative, arranged under President Trump's executive order, aims to resettle Afrikaners facing what he claims is government-sponsored race-based discrimination, a claim strongly denied by South Africa's government. The resettlement process has been unusually fast compared to the typical refugee process. The move has strained relations between South Africa and the United States, with South Africa's foreign ministry criticizing the resettlement as politically motivated and questioning the country's constitutional democracy.

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, described as a “palace in the sky,” from Qatar’s royal family, prompting accusations of bribery and corruption. Qatar acknowledged discussions with the US about the possible transfer of a plane for Trump's use as Air Force One, but denied a final decision or that it was a gift. The plane, estimated to be about $400m, would be used as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of Trump’s second term. The gift has triggered criticisms, with concerns raised about bribery, foreign influence, and surveillance aspects.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States made "substantial progress" in trade talks with China after meetings in Geneva, with details to be released on Monday. The talks aim to ease tensions following increased tariffs on Chinese imports by the Trump administration. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, suggested a "deal" had been reached, addressing national security concerns about China’s trade practices. He Lifeng, China’s vice premier, described the talks as "candid, in-depth and constructive." The discussions have major implications for the global economy, which has been rocked by the tariffs imposed by both countries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program raises concerns among parents of students with disabilities about reduced federal oversight and potential limitations on educational opportunities. Under the proposed budget, money earmarked for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) comes with a promise to limit the federal government’s role in education and provide states with greater flexibility, which could mean drastically reducing oversight of how states use that money. The article highlights the importance of federal oversight in ensuring fair education for students with disabilities, citing examples of segregated classrooms and resistance to inclusive education. The author argues that without federal oversight, states may not be held accountable for meeting minimum requirements of IDEA, potentially leading to an erosion of educational rights and opportunities for disabled students.</p>

The announcement came after a legal defeat over his security arrangements in Britain.

Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed.

          <p>Democrats are seeking to capitalize on parents' concerns over rising prices of baby gear, the spread of vaccine misinformation, and cuts to support programs, linking these issues to President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Trump administration’s policies are reaching ever deeper into the lives of American families, transforming routine and apolitical parts of some parents’ days — trips to the pediatrician, conversations at swim classes, chatter on online baby gear forums — into scenes of anxiety and anger. The strategy aims to persuade voters that the White House is making their lives harder, though Republicans have been more successful at tapping into parents' emotions in recent years. While concerns about the Trump administration’s stewardship of public health are not guaranteed to prompt electoral backlash, Democrats believe that they are beginning to work, with congressional Republicans agonizing over their push to cut Medicaid spending.</p>
