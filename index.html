          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has replaced all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee (ACIP) to restore public trust in vaccine science. Kennedy stated the move prioritizes unbiased science and transparency, insulated from conflicts of interest. The previous members were appointed during the Biden administration, and Kennedy claimed the changes were necessary to prevent the committee from acting as a rubber stamp for industry profits. Critics, including health advocacy organizations and former CDC directors, have expressed concern that this action undermines trust in public health processes and could fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the Trump administration for deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles without his consent, arguing the action is unconstitutional and exceeds presidential authority. The lawsuit follows Trump's decision to send in the National Guard to address protests over federal immigration enforcement actions, a move Newsom views as an unwarranted escalation. Newsom also stated that Trump threatened to arrest him for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. The governor and state Attorney General Rob Bonta argue that local law enforcement is capable of managing the situation and that Trump's actions are politically motivated.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that Chinese equities may not be as undervalued as they appear due to the country's economic slowdown impacting corporate earnings. According to Mark Davids, co-head of Asia-Pacific equities, investors should carefully select stocks and sectors to find potential winners. While Chinese stocks have rallied this year, global investors remain underweight on them. Davids argues that an improvement in the profitability of Chinese companies is necessary for a re-rating, which is challenging given the weak economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric car brands are expanding into global markets, offering cheaper alternatives but raising concerns about security risks and competition for established manufacturers. BYD, now the world's largest EV maker, is launching affordable models like the Dolphin Surf in Europe. While consumers benefit from lower prices, experts worry about potential spyware and hacking risks associated with internet-enabled vehicles. The US and EU have imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, but the UK has not, leading to debate over fair competition and the future of the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers highlight Chancellor Rachel Reeves's reversal on winter fuel payments and the government's Â£14bn investment in the Sizewell C nuclear plant. Many papers criticize the U-turn on winter fuel payments as "fuelish" and "humiliating," while others celebrate it as a victory for pensioners. The investment in Sizewell C is seen as a significant step toward clean energy, with Energy Secretary Ed Miliband declaring a new "golden age" for the British nuclear industry. The papers also cover other news, including Greta Thunberg's detention in Israel and the impact of protests in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC advises investors to wait for Circle Internet stock to cool off before buying, citing its rapid valuation increase. He acknowledges the company's solid business and the popularity of its USDC stablecoin, but finds it hard to justify the current valuation. Cramer also warns about the IPO market getting "a little crazy," using CoreWeave as an example. He suggests patience will offer a better buying opportunity, as the company remains linked to the volatile crypto ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Trump and California has deteriorated, marked by federal funding cuts and the deployment of the National Guard without the governor's consent. Trump's actions are seen as an attempt to provoke a confrontation with California and expand federal control over states. This has led to increased tensions between the federal government and states, with discussions of California withholding federal taxes. The situation highlights a shift from traditional conservative support for states' rights and a growing appreciation for states' rights among progressives.</p>
