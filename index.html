          <p>Following a legal challenge from Washington D.C. officials, the Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of the city's police department. The agreement, reached after a federal judge expressed skepticism about the administration's authority, ensures that the current Metropolitan Police Department chief, Pamela Smith, will remain in control. This development de-escalates a significant conflict over local governance and federal power, particularly regarding the enforcement of federal immigration policies within the sanctuary city.</p>

          <p>Riverside Poly High School's girls' volleyball team has forfeited a game against Jurupa Valley High School, reportedly due to the presence of a transgender athlete on the opposing team's roster. While the school did not officially state a reason, a school board member confirmed the decision was a response to safety concerns and the ongoing debate surrounding transgender athletes in girls' sports. This event highlights the contentious cultural and political issues at play, with some parents and students advocating for policies that align with the "Save Girls Sports" movement.</p>

          <p>An internal review found that Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," meticulously planned his escape from an Arkansas prison over six months. He exploited what he described as "very lax" security in the prison kitchen to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform. The report details significant procedural failures, including a guard unlocking a gate without verifying Hardin's identity, which has led to the firing of two employees and a review of systemic security issues.</p>

          <p>Despite optimistic statements from both leaders, the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a tangible deal or ceasefire for the war in Ukraine. Trump claimed "great progress" was made, but the lack of specific commitments leaves the conflict unresolved. The outcome is seen as a setback for Trump's image as a dealmaker, though some European allies may be relieved that no unilateral concessions were made that could undermine future negotiations or their security interests.</p>
