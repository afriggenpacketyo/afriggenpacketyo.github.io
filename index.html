          <p>Costco has reintroduced its popular combo pizza in a calzone format, priced at $6.99 and filled with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, onions, peppers, olives, and mushrooms. The new "Combo Calzone" has received mixed reviews from Costco members on Reddit, with some expressing disappointment and a desire for the return of the original combo pizza. Some customers found the calzone overcooked or unappetizing in appearance, while others enjoyed the new offering. The article notes that not all Costco locations currently offer the calzone. Optimism is moderate due to the divided opinions on the new food item.</p>

David has written a book about his family's experiences and advocates for greater protection for victims of domestic abuse.

          <p>Senator Rand Paul voiced his opposition to President Trump's "one big beautiful bill," citing concerns about excessive spending and the inclusion of a debt ceiling increase. Paul argues that the bill allocates too much money to the military budget and border security, especially since he believes the border flow has been stopped without new money. He is particularly against raising the debt ceiling as part of the legislation. Paul indicated he could support the tax components of the bill if the debt ceiling provision is removed.</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), questioned whether the White House needs congressional approval for all of President Trump's proposed cuts to the federal workforce. Vought suggested the administration might rely on "executive tools" for most cuts instead of seeking congressional sign-off. He defended the cuts proposed in the One Big Beautiful Bill, despite criticism that they could increase the deficit. Vought also mentioned the use of "impoundment," which involves withholding funds allocated by Congress, as a potential tool, though its legality is debated.</p>

          <p>A teenage transgender athlete, AB Hernandez, won two track events in California, tying for first place in the high jump and the triple jump. This occurred amidst threats from the Trump administration to withhold federal funding from California for allowing trans athletes to compete in girlsâ€™ sports. The California Interscholastic Federation has changed its rules so that if a transgender athlete places in a girlsâ€™ event, the athlete who finishes just behind will also receive the same place and medal. Hernandez's participation has sparked national attention and attacks by right-wing groups.</p>
