          <p>In Polk County, Florida, deputies fatally shot a 42-year-old man, Timothy Shultz, after he was attacked by an alligator and subsequently charged at them with garden shears. Shultz had been acting erratically, reportedly growling at witnesses and attempting to break into a truck. Deputies initially responded to reports of a man acting "bizarre" at a Racetrack gas station, then later to a call about a man in a lake filled with alligators. After exiting the lake, Shultz charged at deputies with the shears and then attempted to seize a weapon from a patrol vehicle, leading to the shooting. </p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of the Starship megarocket, achieving orbit but experiencing a propellant leak that led to a loss of attitude control. This resulted in the spacecraft spinning and re-entering Earth's atmosphere at an uncontrolled angle, likely causing it to burn up over the Indian Ocean. The company cleared a large landing zone to ensure public safety. The Super Heavy booster also experienced a catastrophic failure upon attempting a controlled splashdown in the Gulf. SpaceX plans to review the data and continue working towards improving Starship's reliability for future missions to make life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley is warning that government pledges to reduce crime may not be achievable without substantial additional funding for policing. He points to a decade of underinvestment, increasing demands, and social volatility as reasons for the current strain on police forces. Rowley and other chief constables emphasized that police forces are overstretched, burdened with debt, and using outdated technology. He directly appealed to the Chancellor, stating that without investment, government promises to restore neighborhood policing and halve knife crime and violence against women and girls cannot be fulfilled.</p>

Terrell, who leads a multiagency task force on combating antisemitism, claims that these campuses, including UCLA, USC, and UC Berkeley, have resisted task force investigators. The Justice Department also launched a civil rights investigation into allegations of antisemitism at the University of California, citing a potential pattern of discrimination against Jewish employees.

          <p>SpaceX's ninth test flight of the Super Heavy-Starship rocket faced setbacks as contact was lost with the Starship upper stage during reentry. The Super Heavy first stage also experienced a catastrophic failure during its descent. The Starship upper stage reached its planned sub-orbital trajectory, but a door malfunction prevented the deployment of simulated Starlink satellites. An apparent propellant leak then caused the spacecraft to spin, ruling out a controlled reentry. Despite these challenges, the launch provided valuable data for future development efforts.</p>

The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million to support their lavish lifestyle.

          <p>The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) is changing its competition rules at the state track and field championships to allow more girls to participate, following controversy over a trans student-athlete's participation. This change comes after Donald Trump criticized the inclusion of a trans athlete in girls' sports. The federation will extend participation opportunities to biological female athletes who narrowly missed qualifying marks. The rule change may be the first attempt nationally by a high school sports governing body to expand competition when trans athletes are participating, though the action is so far limited to a single meet.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space during its ninth test flight but faced challenges upon reentry. The spacecraft experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up during its descent back to Earth. While the mission demonstrated progress in fixing issues from previous flights, several planned tests, including satellite deployment and heat shield assessment, were not conducted. The Super Heavy booster was also lost during a landing simulation. SpaceX continues to gather data to improve the spacecraft's reusability and reliability for future missions.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Significant Decline in Mothers' Mental Health</h2>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a steep decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The study, involving nearly 200,000 mothers, found a significant decrease in the percentage who rated their mental health as "excellent" and an increase in those reporting "poor" or "fair" mental health. Single parents and mothers with children on Medicaid or who are uninsured were particularly affected. Experts suggest potential factors contributing to this decline include high costs of housing, child care, and food, as well as a lack of national paid parental leave.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kara Hochreiter, a dietitian, suggests that golden milk is the best late-night drink for gut health due to its anti-inflammatory properties and soothing effect. Golden milk, a blend of turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and dairy-free milk, contains compounds like curcumin that may reduce inflammation in the gut lining. Additionally, ginger may support gut motility, and the drink can contribute to hydration, promoting smoother bowel movements. Incorporating golden milk into a nightly routine can help you wind down and support optimal overnight gut healing.</p>
