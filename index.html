          <p>A tragic accident involving the historic Gloria funicular in Lisbon, Portugal, has resulted in the deaths of 15 people and left 18 others hospitalized. Eyewitness reports suggest a failure of the braking system caused the 140-year-old cable car to hurtle down a steep hill and crash into a building. The city's mayor has called it a "tragic moment," and the government has declared a day of national mourning while an investigation into the cause is underway.</p>

          <p>The article posits that China's recent, technologically advanced military parade serves as a potent symbol of the geopolitical realignments being accelerated by President Trump's "America First" trade policies. His administration's use of tariffs has scrambled traditional economic partnerships, fostering closer ties between nations like China, Russia, and India. This emerging bloc presents a new and complex challenge to the U.S.-led international order, highlighting the diplomatic risks of the current trade strategy.</p>

          <p>The article examines the implications of President Trump's authorization of a military strike against alleged drug smugglers, framing it as a significant policy shift that blurs the line between military action and civilian law enforcement. By labeling cartels as "narco-terrorists" and using military force, the administration is expanding counterterrorism tactics into crime fighting. This move challenges the long-held U.S. principle, dating back to the nation's founding, of separating the roles of the armed forces and police.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Salesforce fell more than 4% in extended trading after the company issued a disappointing financial outlook, despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates. The stock's decline was primarily driven by a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the upcoming third quarter. This soft guidance has fueled investor concerns about the software giant's near-term growth prospects in a challenging economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the publication Electrek features leaked messages from 2021 that suggest a contradiction between Elon Musk's private and public statements on Tesla's self-driving technology. In the conversation, Musk allegedly admitted that a high-resolution radar system would be safer than a purely vision-based one. This contrasts with his later decision to remove radar from Tesla vehicles and his public assertions that doing so improves safety by reducing "sensor contention."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliation. The court found that the current situation does not meet the law's criteria of an "invasion or predatory incursion." This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of using the obscure, wartime statute to expedite the removal of certain groups of migrants.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the UK's main federation of trade unions, is urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider introducing a range of wealth taxes in the next budget. The TUC's general secretary argued that such measures are necessary to boost investment in public services and create a more progressive tax system. Specific suggestions include new taxes on the windfall profits of banks and financial institutions, which have benefited from a high-interest rate environment.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has delivered a stern warning to Israel, stating that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would cross a "red line" and severely damage the spirit of the 2020 Abraham Accords. A senior Emirati official described potential annexation as the "death knell" for the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The warning came after a far-right Israeli minister unveiled a proposal for the annexation of approximately 80% of the West Bank.</p>
