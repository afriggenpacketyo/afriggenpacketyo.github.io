            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among American consumers. With the threat of increased prices on imported goods, some shoppers are engaging in panic buying, while others are hesitant to make purchases, unsure of future price changes. The tariffs, including a significant levy on goods from China, are expected to impact the cost of clothing, electronics, and toys. Economists predict a potential rise in unemployment and a slowdown in economic growth due to reduced consumer spending, as families may face a substantial increase in annual expenses.

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel under emergency powers to prevent the closure of its Scunthorpe plant. The move follows concerns that the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, would shut down its blast furnaces, ending primary steel production in the UK. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds indicated the government's likely next step would be to nationalize the plant. The government hopes to secure private investment but is prepared for public ownership to maintain the nation's steel industry.</p>

            <p>President Trump is targeting certain law firms with executive orders, prompting legal challenges and concerns about the abuse of executive power. Susman Godfrey, a law firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems, has filed a lawsuit to block Trump's executive order, arguing it is retaliatory and unconstitutional. The executive order seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. The lawsuit raises concerns about the potential for future presidents to retaliate against perceived foes.</p>

            <p>A federal immigration judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, is deportable due to his advocacy for Palestinian rights at Columbia University. Critics argue that the government is seeking to deport Khalil solely for his constitutionally protected speech. The ACLU speculated that the decision to deport Khalil had been “pre-written”, as it was delivered so fast. The case raises concerns about the government's ability to suppress dissent and regulate opinion. The ruling is being appealed in federal court.</p>

These builders are focused on creating new solutions for user data storage, open-source development, and energy management for bitcoin mining. The return of President Trump has brought a surge of pro-bitcoin policy moves, including pardons, a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and a "crypto czar." This shift has boosted the morale of the Bitcoin community and is driving innovation in the space. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to cause significant and irreversible damage to many American businesses. Canceled freight orders and abandoned freight are becoming common, as businesses halt container exports due to the tariffs. Experts predict that the tariffs will lead to widespread product shortages and lost sales, particularly for small businesses. The new exemption for technology can be partially explained by how the supply chain works, but also reinforces where the greatest pain will be felt. (not investment advice)</p>

The Delta flights were redirected due to weather risks in Atlanta.

The nearby Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport has customs but wasn't a feasible option for the diverted planes because of intense storms.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences unveiled dire wolf puppies created through gene editing, sparking debate on de-extinction efforts. Scientists argue the project creates a new animal closer to grey wolves than the extinct dire wolf. Ethically, the welfare of these animals, without kin or a natural habitat, is questionable. A Nature study suggests de-extinction could cause more species loss than gain, as resources might be better spent conserving existing endangered species. The project is being used to undermine endangered species protections.</p>
