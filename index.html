          <p>The 2025 Notting Hill Carnival began in west London with its traditional children's parade, filling the streets with vibrant costumes and music. The festivities kicked off at dawn with J'ouvert, where revelers celebrated with bright paint and powder to mark the start of Europe's largest street party. The event, which has been running for over 50 years, will also include a 72-second silence each day to honor the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's 34th Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant address, vowing the nation would continue fighting for its freedom until its calls for a just peace are heard. The celebrations in Kyiv were attended by international allies, including Canada's Prime Minister, who reaffirmed their unwavering support. The anniversary was marked by overnight Russian drone attacks, including one that caused a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant, though no injuries were reported and radiation levels remained normal.</p>

          <p>Russia's top nuclear official, Alexei Likhachev, stated that Moscow faces "colossal threats" and must improve its nuclear capabilities to guarantee the country's sovereignty. His comments come shortly after a summit between Presidents Putin and Trump, where little concrete progress was made toward a ceasefire in Ukraine. With the New START treaty set to expire in 2026 and Russia's participation paused, these remarks add to the growing uncertainty surrounding international arms control agreements.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy criticizes the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and its disregard for the climate crisis. She argues that despite the federal government's direction, millions of Americans, along with states, cities, and corporations, are continuing to advance clean energy initiatives. The article points to significant progress in states like California, Florida, and Texas as evidence that the clean energy transition is continuing, driven by economic and environmental benefits.</p>

          <p>The article argues that artificial intelligence should be designed to collaborate with human experts, not to prematurely automate entire jobs where it is still imperfect. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it explains that flawed automation can undermine human expertise and lead to poor outcomes. The piece suggests that AI's true potential lies in augmenting human skills, creating a partnership that leverages the complementary strengths of both humans and machines for better results.</p>

          <p>The article examines the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), noting its growth but highlighting a deep internal rift that prevents it from becoming a unified political force. It contrasts a mainstream, electoral-focused wing with a more radical, sectarian wing whose extremist positions alienate potential allies and voters. This factionalism, evident at its recent convention, undermines the potential of popular socialist figures and prevents the organization from adopting a cohesive national strategy.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the practice of reading aloud to a newborn, not just for the child's development but for the parent's ability to connect and interpret their baby's responses. The author discusses how this shared activity helps build a world of meaning for the child and deepens the parent's bond by learning to 'read' their child's expressions. The piece notes a recent survey suggesting a decline in this practice, arguing that parents who don't read to their kids are missing a profound opportunity.</p>

Artists whose work was singled out have responded with a mix of shock, defiance, and concern, with some calling it a "badge of honor" and others fearing a chilling effect on artistic expression. The administration's move is seen by critics as an attempt to align the nation's cultural institutions with its political agenda.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's policy decisions, both at home and abroad, are consistently driven by his personal grievances and self-interest rather than a coherent ideology. Examples cited include taking election advice from Vladimir Putin leading to a proposed ban on mail-in voting and using meetings with foreign leaders like Ukraine's President Zelenskyy to attack domestic political rivals. This conflation of personal and state interests marks a radical departure from the conduct of previous U.S. presidents.</p>

Recent high-level diplomatic exchanges and moves to restore travel and investment links are seen as positive steps.

          <p>Over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in this year's "Northern Strike" military exercises in Michigan, the largest-ever contingent from the island. The public acknowledgment of these figures by U.S. military-linked media marks a significant shift from a previous policy of ambiguity regarding Taiwan's involvement in American drills. This development is widely interpreted as a sign of deepening defense cooperation between Washington and Taipei, despite the Trump administration's often transactional foreign policy approach.</p>
