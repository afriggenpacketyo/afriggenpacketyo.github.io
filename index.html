        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its suppliers to pause production of the H20 AI chip, which was specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls for the Chinese market. This move follows the Chinese government's directive to local tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent to stop purchasing the chips pending a national security review. Beijing has raised concerns about potential "backdoors" or tracking technology in the chips, a claim Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has denied. The situation underscores the escalating tech tensions and regulatory challenges Nvidia faces in navigating the complex trade relationship between the U.S. and China.</p>

According to the LAPD, the rapper, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, allegedly charged at officers during the encounter. He was subsequently taken into custody on suspicion of misdemeanor obstructing an officer and transported to a hospital for a suspected overdose.

          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, 36 years after he and his brother Lyle murdered their parents. The board determined that Menendez, now 54, would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, citing his prison conduct rather than the severity of the original crime. Commissioners pointed to violations such as drug smuggling and illegal cellphone use, stating he has not been a "model prisoner." Despite support from relatives who have forgiven him, the board concluded he remains unsuitable for release and will not be eligible for another parole hearing for three years.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from Northern California, Julian Her, may have set a new junior world record after catching a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass in Tomales Bay. The catch, which is significantly larger than the young angler, is currently being documented for verification by the International Game Fish Association. If certified, it would break the previous junior record of 59 pounds, which was set in 2002. The impressive feat has brought local fame to the eighth-grader, who was on a family fishing trip at the time of the remarkable catch.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction to halt operations at a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling prohibits the transfer of new detainees and any further construction at the site, citing violations of the National Environmental Policy Act. The judge agreed with a coalition of environmental groups and a Native American Tribe that the government failed to conduct necessary environmental reviews, posing a risk of irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem. The Trump administration has been ordered to remove temporary structures from the site within 60 days.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month but still higher than economists' expectations. This marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, fueling debate about the central bank's monetary policy. The slight cooling was partly attributed to easing rice prices, which had previously surged. Despite the moderation, some analysts argue the Bank of Japan is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates to combat the persistent inflationary pressures affecting consumer purchasing power.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in her dissent, criticized the ruling as "Calvinball jurisprudence" designed to ensure the administration wins.

          <p>Families who lost babies under the care of the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust have expressed frustration after a meeting regarding a national review of maternity services. The group, which has been campaigning for an independent inquiry, stated they feel "ignored, exhausted and dismissed" after meeting with the review's chair, Baroness Amos. They claimed the chair was unprepared and that no progress was made on their specific demands, including the appointment of senior midwife Donna Ockenden to lead their local investigation. The families also raised concerns about the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, questioning its independence.</p>

          <p>French authorities are investigating the death of Raphaël Graven, a 46-year-old streamer known as Jean Pormanove, who died on a live broadcast during a nearly 300-hour challenge. The stream featured what appeared to be abusive and humiliating treatment by fellow streamers, including physical assaults and degrading stunts. While an autopsy indicated his death was not from traumatic injury, the incident has sparked horror and raised questions about the ethics and safety of extreme online content.

          <p>The online message board 4chan will refuse to pay fines proposed by Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, for failing to comply with the country's Online Safety Act. A lawyer for the U.S.-based company stated that Ofcom's notices "create no legal obligations in the United States" and that American courts will not enforce foreign penal fines or censorship codes. Ofcom is investigating whether 4chan is adequately protecting its UK users from illegal content. The standoff highlights the growing jurisdictional conflict between U.S. tech firms, which cite First Amendment protections, and international regulators seeking to enforce their own content laws.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products. The guidance also calls for an end to the marketing of snack foods for babies under one year old and restricts the use of unsubstantiated health claims on packaging. Companies have been given 18 months to comply, after which the government may consider "additional or alternative measures." The move follows investigations that found many commercial baby food products, particularly pouches and snacks, were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients, despite being marketed as healthy options for infants.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited a U.S. park police facility in Washington D.C. to promote his administration's takeover of the city's law enforcement to combat crime. During his remarks, Trump declared the crackdown a success and also made a freewheeling promise to re-landscape the city's parks with new grass to make them resemble his golf courses. The visit follows the deployment of National Guard troops and federal agents across the city under a legal authority invoked by Trump. The administration claims the surge has led to more arrests, while D.C.'s mayor has pushed back against the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he called "about as good of a quarter as any retailer could have." Walmart raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating strong topline growth and margin expansion even while absorbing the impact of tariffs. Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a slight earnings miss caused by one-time expenses, rather than a systemic issue. He argued that the retailer's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices makes its current performance and future outlook exceptionally strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, aiming to reverse six consecutive years of sales declines for the iconic brand. The new midsize SUV will feature Stellantis's first hybrid powertrain in North America, offering over 500 miles per tank of fuel, and a technology-focused interior. The company discontinued the previous Cherokee model in 2023 as a cost-cutting measure. The relaunch of the popular nameplate is a key part of the strategy to regain market share in a competitive segment, as the automaker also navigates headwinds from U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>A global arms race for hypersonic missiles is intensifying, with China and Russia currently leading in the development of these advanced weapons. Hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, pose a significant challenge to existing detection and defense systems. While the U.S. and UK are now investing heavily to catch up, they are behind nations that began prioritizing this technology years ago. The proliferation of these weapons, which can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, is altering strategic calculations and raising concerns about a new era of geopolitical instability.</p>
