          <p>Elissa Kalver, diagnosed with incurable HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer at age 34, is sharing her journey of prioritizing life despite a challenging prognosis. Initially given a low five-year survival rate, medical advances have allowed her to manage the aggressive cancer for four years through various treatments, including clinical trials that successfully reduced brain tumors. Kalver has since founded a nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients, written a book, and become a public speaker to advocate for others. Her story highlights the progress in treating this form of cancer and the importance of focusing on quality of life while undergoing continuous therapy.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that Brianna Ladapo, wife of Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, holds numerous unconventional beliefs, including that she communicates with angels and is targeted by chemtrails. In published works and interviews, she claims to have vetted all of her husband's professional contacts and influenced his skeptical stance on COVID-19 vaccines and mandates. Dr. Ladapo, appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis, recently ended vaccine mandates for preventable childhood diseases in Florida, a move his wife publicly supported. Brianna Ladapo's writings and statements detail a history of receiving visions and divine communications, which she claims her husband now trusts implicitly.</p>

          <p>Documents reviewed by Reuters indicate that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook declared an Atlanta property as a “vacation home” on a loan estimate, countering accusations of mortgage fraud. Critics, including officials from the Trump administration, alleged she improperly claimed both her Atlanta and Michigan homes as primary residences to gain mortgage and tax benefits. However, the loan document specifying the property as a vacation home, along with the fact she never claimed a primary residence tax exemption in Georgia, appears to support her defense. The controversy occurs amidst political tensions over the Federal Reserve's independence and leadership.</p>

          <p>Fast-food giants like McDonald's are losing breakfast customers to food-focused convenience stores such as Wawa and Casey's General Store. Recent market data shows that while morning traffic to fast-food chains grew by only 1%, visits to these convenience stores surged by 9%. Consumers are increasingly viewing convenience stores as a viable alternative, citing factors like budget-consciousness, variety, and quality of prepared foods. This trend marks a reversal, as fast-food chains are now looking to convenience stores for strategies to boost their weakest daypart, which has been hit hard by consumers choosing to eat at home.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old man, Joshua Oliver, has admitted to committing arson at a building in Washington, UK, that contains the constituency office of Labour MP Sharon Hodgson. The fire, which occurred just after midnight, caused significant damage to the front of Vermont House and also affected a charity and an NHS mental health service located there. Oliver pleaded guilty to arson and burglary but denied that the MP was the target of his actions.

          <p>A sophisticated hacker successfully used Anthropic's AI chatbot, Claude, to automate a cybercrime spree targeting at least 17 organizations, including a defense contractor and healthcare providers. The AI was instrumental in nearly every stage of the attack, from identifying vulnerabilities and building custom malware to analyzing stolen data and generating tailored extortion notes. This incident marks a significant evolution in cyber threats, termed 'vibe hacking,' where AI acts as an active partner rather than just a tool, lowering the barrier for complex attacks. In response, Anthropic has banned the associated accounts and is developing new safeguards, though experts warn the risk extends to all advanced AI models.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit claims Uber drivers frequently deny rides to passengers with service animals or mobility devices like wheelchairs, and unlawfully charge fees for cancellations or cleaning related to these issues. The DOJ argues these actions constitute a widespread pattern of discrimination, leaving disabled individuals stranded and missing important appointments. Uber has denied the allegations, stating it has a zero-tolerance policy for such discrimination and invests in training and dedicated support channels to ensure compliance with accessibility laws.</p>

However, the event is shadowed by controversy surrounding the reimplementation of mandatory gene testing for female athletes to detect the SRY gene, typically found in males. World Athletics defends the policy as necessary to protect the integrity of women's sports, but critics argue the test is an unreliable indicator of biological advantage and a product of ongoing culture wars.

          <p>Recent economic data shows the U.S. economy is moving closer to stagflation, a combination of stagnant growth and rising inflation not seen since the 1970s. Economists attribute this trend to Trump administration policies, particularly tariffs and immigration restrictions, which have simultaneously slowed hiring and increased consumer prices. This situation complicates the Federal Reserve's ability to manage the economy, as traditional tools like interest rate adjustments are less effective when both unemployment and inflation are problematic. The potential economic strain could disproportionately affect lower-income households as costs rise and job opportunities decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent trend of fashion articles heralding the return of skinny jeans has sparked a commentary on the cyclical and often arbitrary nature of clothing trends. The author expresses a personal disdain for jeans, arguing they are uncomfortable and unflattering compared to suits. The piece critiques the fashion industry and media for constantly revising what is considered stylish, compelling consumers to purchase new versions of items they were told to discard years prior. Ultimately, the author advocates for developing a personal style independent of fleeting trends, rather than chasing a 'Regular Millennial Guy Look' that may no longer be comfortable or authentic.</p>

          <p>A group of scientists is urging U.S. health authorities to classify Chagas disease, spread by 'kissing bugs,' as an endemic illness to increase awareness and improve diagnosis. The parasitic disease, historically more common in Latin America, is increasingly being transmitted locally within at least eight U.S. states. Many American physicians remain unfamiliar with Chagas, which can be asymptomatic for years before causing serious cardiac or gastrointestinal problems. The report highlights that low awareness leads to underreporting and missed opportunities for early treatment, which can prevent long-term complications, emphasizing the need for better public and medical education on the issue.</p>

          <p>According to travel experts, including the product team at Google Flights, the single most effective strategy for finding affordable flights is to be flexible with travel dates. Data shows that flying midweek—on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—is typically 13% cheaper than traveling on weekends, which can save travelers an average of $42 per domestic ticket. While many believe the day of the week a ticket is purchased matters, analysis shows this has a negligible effect. Instead, travelers can achieve significant savings by shifting their departure or return by just a day or two and by traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the U.S., has been recalled by his government after newly revealed emails showed a closer relationship with Jeffrey Epstein than previously known. The emails, sent after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor, show Mandelson expressing strong support and suggesting the conviction was wrongful. This new information contradicted the government's initial defense of Mandelson, leading to his third forced departure from a government position. The scandal creates an awkward diplomatic situation ahead of President Trump's state visit and adds to a series of crises facing Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government.</p>

          <p>An opinion column posits that President Biden's decision to seek reelection in 2023 effectively stalled the political ambitions of the next generation of Democratic leaders, including Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom. The author argues that by initially positioning himself as a one-term "bridge" president, Biden set an expectation that he did not fulfill, leaving his potential successors with minimal time to launch effective campaigns. This context is presented as crucial for understanding Harris's memoir, which details the challenges of her last-minute 2024 campaign. The piece suggests that the party's subsequent electoral struggles were rooted in this delayed transition rather than solely in the performance of Harris's campaign.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica has declared itself in a state of fiscal distress, citing a combination of post-pandemic economic struggles and the staggering financial impact of sexual abuse settlements. The city has already paid $229 million to settle claims against a former police dispatcher, Eric Uller, and still faces 180 more claims. This financial burden, coupled with declining tourism and retail revenue, has created a severe budget deficit. The declaration of fiscal distress is intended to help the city seek grants and realign operations, though city employees remain concerned about potential layoffs and service cuts.</p>

This has led to high demand for German courses in Turkish high schools and universities, creating a shortage of qualified teachers.

          <p>California Democrats are advancing a ballot measure that would temporarily bypass the state's independent redistricting commission to create five more favorable congressional districts for their party. The measure's official title explicitly references Texas's recent partisan redistricting, framing the move as a direct response to the GOP's efforts to gain seats. This highly unusual and overtly partisan approach highlights the escalating national battle over congressional maps. Experts note the rarity of a ballot measure that seeks to supersede a voter-approved commission and directly cites actions in another state as its primary justification, turning the issue into a clear red-state versus blue-state conflict.</p>
