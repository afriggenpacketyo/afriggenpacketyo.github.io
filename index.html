          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for expelling transgender troops, instructing personnel to address them according to their medical assignment at birth, potentially misgendering them even if they are superior officers. The guidance outlines criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria, including past requests for grooming standard exemptions or "overt conduct" on social media, potentially violating their dignity and privacy. Major Kara Corcoran, a transgender infantry officer, criticized the policy as worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," overtly targeting transgender service members, while the Army claims it will treat all soldiers with dignity and respect, though separations will result in an RE-3 enlistment code, barring re-entry without a waiver. The situation raises concerns about national security interests and potential future employment complications for transgender veterans. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced at a U.S. Steel factory outside Pittsburgh that he intends to double tariffs on foreign steel to 50%. The president believes this increase will further secure the steel industry, preventing foreign steel from being able to "get over the fence." Trump was speaking at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works after indicating support for a merger with Japan's Nippon, a deal that includes commitments to keep U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a decade and provide workers with a $5,000 bonus. While Trump describes the deal as a partnership controlled by the USA, details on the structure remain scarce.</p>

          <p>The Navy has halted its funding for dog and cat experiments after receiving a letter from PETA to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the termination of all Department of the Navy testing on cats and dogs. PETA is urging the Department of Defense to conduct an agency-wide audit to eliminate waste and abuse in animal experimentation, specifically requesting a ban on animals in Navy decompression sickness and Army weapon-wounding tests. The organization claims the Navy has spent over $5.1 million since 2020 on decompression sickness tests on animals at multiple universities, involving procedures that caused suffering and death to pigs and rats.</p>

          <p>The last hospital providing health services in the North Gaza governorate, al-Awda hospital, has ceased operations after the Israeli military ordered its immediate evacuation, according to the facility's director.

The hospital faced bombing and shooting from tanks before the evacuation, with staff carrying patients to ambulances parked away from the hospital due to destroyed roads. The WHO Director-General stated that the closure of al-Awda means there is no remaining functioning hospital in the North Gaza governorate, reiterating calls for the protection of civilians and health workers.</p>

Adams stated that taking the case was about "putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation," while the BBC expressed disappointment and defended its journalism.

          <p>After a federal court struck down President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative legal pathways to enact trade duties. The ruling, which has been temporarily halted by an appeals court, puts much of Trump's trade agenda at risk. Experts suggest the administration could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 or Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, but these options have limitations compared to the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House maintains its commitment to addressing trade deficits using all available legal tools. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging his executive order to cut off its federal funding. PBS argues that the order is retaliatory, stemming from "perceived political slights in news coverage," and violates the Constitution's protections of speech and press freedom. The lawsuit also cites a federal telecommunications law that prohibits government interference in public telecommunications content. The White House defended the order, stating that the CPB was "creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime."</p>

          <p>China is scaling up the use of AI in urban management through its "smart cities" initiative, employing technologies like drones for nightly patrols in Nanjing to address challenges brought by urbanization. The AI focuses on patrolling blind spots ignored by human patrols, enhancing urban management. However, analysts warn that China's AI governance faces challenges such as privacy protection and limited community involvement, mirroring issues in other countries adopting the technology. These challenges highlight the need for careful consideration and ethical frameworks as AI becomes more integrated into urban environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times suggests a link between therapy culture and the rising rate of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author posits that the redefinition of harm and trauma, along with high expectations for parents, contributes to a reluctance to have children. The piece argues that the fear of failing to meet these standards, combined with a heightened awareness of potential childhood struggles, leads many to forgo parenthood. The cultural shift has created a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising just 2.1% compared to a year earlier. This is down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September, with core prices also showing a decrease. Despite rising incomes, consumer spending slowed, potentially reflecting caution in response to higher goods prices, although economists have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect.

Despite his commitment to tariffs, Trump's administration has shown volatility in trade policy, announcing, suspending, and reducing tariffs on various countries. This pattern has led investors to anticipate his reversals, but the president's awareness of the TACO trade could disrupt this strategy, potentially leading to negative economic consequences if he follows through on harmful tariffs.</p>
