          <p>With President Trump's ever-changing tariffs causing uncertainty, consumers are seeking ways to save money. Experts advise looking for sales during Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day. Checking the origin of products is crucial, as goods from Canada and Mexico may be subject to tariffs, while those meeting USMCA rules are exempt. Purchasing domestic products and considering the necessity of items, especially electronics and toys, can also help consumers avoid price hikes.

          <h2>Questions Raised About Appeals System After Wrongful Conviction</h2>

          <p>Peter Sullivan's exoneration after 38 years in prison has raised questions about the effectiveness of the appeals system in England and Wales. Sullivan's conviction for the murder of Diane Sindall was overturned due to DNA evidence, but critics argue the system failed him by not clearing his name sooner. In 2008, Sullivan requested the CCRC to look for DNA evidence, but the request was rejected due to limitations in available testing. The case highlights concerns about whether the appeals system is fit for purpose if an innocent man can remain incarcerated for so long.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has taken control of New York Cityâ€™s Rikers Island jails, appointing an outside official to oversee the troubled facility. Judge Laura Taylor Swain cited persistent violence and dysfunction as reasons for the decision, which comes nearly a decade after the jails fell under federal oversight. The appointed remediation manager will have broad authority to implement necessary changes, despite Mayor Eric Adams's efforts to maintain city control. The city has struggled to improve conditions, even with high spending per inmate, and has been found in contempt for failing to stem violence and excessive force.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan spent over 38 years in jail for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, a crime he did not commit, marking one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British history. Sindall, a 21-year-old florist, was murdered in Birkenhead, sparking a massive manhunt. Sullivan was convicted based on a confession he later retracted and bite mark evidence that has since been discredited. New DNA evidence has exonerated Sullivan, but the real killer has not been identified, leading to renewed concern on Merseyside.</p>
