          <p>Japanese energy firm Jera Co. has committed to ensuring a stable power supply this summer by leveraging its liquefied natural gas (LNG)-fired power plant in Mie Prefecture. The Kawagoe thermal power station, boasting a maximum output of 4.80 million kilowatts, will play a crucial role in compensating for fluctuations in solar power generation, which has been rapidly expanding in the region. Jera seeks to bridge the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. With the region projected to have an electricity reserve rate topping 8 percent this summer, the LNG plant's flexibility will be key to maintaining a consistent power supply during periods of high demand.

          <p>The US and Ukraine have finalized a deal for the joint exploitation of Ukraine's energy and mineral resources, establishing a reconstruction investment fund to bolster Ukraine's economy amid its conflict with Russia. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine, while Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko highlighted the deal's potential to attract global investment. The agreement, seen as crucial for Kyiv to access US military aid, grants Washington access to some of Ukraine's natural resources, including critical minerals like graphite, titanium, and lithium. The deal, delayed by last-minute changes sought by Kyiv, reflects ongoing negotiations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Ukraine possesses approximately 5% of the world's critical raw materials, including significant reserves of graphite, titanium, and lithium, essential for batteries, aerospace, and other industries. The US is keen to secure access to these resources to reduce its reliance on China, which dominates the rare earth mineral market. A newly agreed framework for a minerals deal between the US and Ukraine aims to establish an investment fund for reconstruction in Ukraine and foster economic partnership. However, a substantial portion of Ukraine's mineral deposits is currently under Russian occupation, adding a strategic dimension to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction in an antitrust case brought by Epic Games, accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct related to its App Store. The judge found that Apple deliberately interfered with competition by imposing new commissions on off-app purchases and discouraging customers from using alternative payment platforms. She also alleged that Apple's vice president of finance lied under oath and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a possible criminal contempt investigation.

Protesters aim to reclaim power from corporate elites and express opposition to violent forms of protest. With more than 1,000 events planned in over 1,000 cities, the protests are expected to be the most widespread May Day on record.</p>

          <h2>Trump Seeks More Time as US Economy Contracts</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested additional time to address the US economy, which has contracted for the first time in three years, raising concerns about a potential recession. Trump attributed the downturn to companies stockpiling imports in anticipation of his tariff implementations. He highlighted promises of $8 trillion in inward investment, asserting that this would restore American manufacturing dominance. The US economy experienced a 0.3% annual rate of contraction, a significant decline from the previous quarter's 2.4% growth, as Trump marks 100 days in office amid public discontent over his economic stewardship.</p>

          <p>A US district judge has found Apple willfully violated her injunction in a case brought by Epic Games and that a top Apple executive "outright lied" under oath. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple's Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, lied about when Apple had decided to levy a 27% fee on some purchases linked to its App Store. Rogers referred the matter to U.S. attorneys to investigate whether to pursue criminal contempt proceedings on both Roman and Apple. The judge ordered Apple to stop imposing its commissions on purchases made for iPhone apps through web links inside an app, effective immediately.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert, Qi Xiangdong, has cautioned against excessive reliance on artificial intelligence for decision-making, citing potential security risks and vulnerabilities to hackers. Qi, chairman of Qi An Xin (QAX), highlighted the increasing power of large AI models and the possibility of users becoming overly dependent on AI-assisted judgment. He warned that hackers could exploit vulnerabilities or engage in data poisoning to manipulate the model's decisions, while internal errors could contaminate the model's learning environment. His comments come amidst China's push for widespread AI use, including the development of home-grown chatbots like DeepSeek.</p>
