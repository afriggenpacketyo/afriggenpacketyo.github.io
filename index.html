          <p>An ICE agent shot and killed a man in Franklin Park, Illinois, after the suspect allegedly resisted arrest and attempted to drive his vehicle into the law enforcement team. The suspect, identified as Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, struck and dragged an agent, who then opened fire in self-defense. The agent sustained severe but stable injuries, while Villegas-Gonzalez died at a hospital after crashing his car into a truck. The incident, part of a federal immigration enforcement operation, is now under investigation with FBI assistance.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has confirmed that players Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi will continue to train separately from the first-team squad. Maresca stated he has not seen either player since the season began, as they are using different facilities at the club. This indefinite separation, known colloquially as the "bomb squad," follows the failure of both the forward and the defender to secure transfers away from the club during the recent window. Their future at the club remains uncertain under the current management.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 193 people have died in two separate boat accidents this week in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. One incident involved a vessel with nearly 500 passengers that caught fire and capsized, while another motorized boat capsized a day earlier, killing at least 86 people, many of whom were students. Authorities cite improper loading and night navigation as contributing factors, highlighting the ongoing dangers of river travel in the region. These tragedies underscore a recurring issue where overloaded and poorly maintained vessels are common.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's lawyers have refuted claims that the pop star agreed to be deposed in the ongoing legal dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Baldoni's legal team had requested a deadline extension to accommodate Swift's testimony, which Lively's attorneys argue is a tactic to create a media spectacle. Swift's counsel maintains she has no material role in the case but will comply if compelled by the court, though her schedule only permits a deposition in late October. The conflict stems from dueling lawsuits between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services plans to award a no-bid contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to research potential links between vaccinations and autism. The contract is justified by the engineering school's "unique ability" to analyze data, specifically the work of a professor using AI to find patterns in blood samples. This move, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has drawn criticism from scientists who note that extensive research has already debunked this link. Critics argue the funding could be better used for other pressing autism research questions.</p>

          <p>A major cyber attack has forced Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to halt production worldwide, with UK factories remaining idle for nearly two weeks. While JLR is expected to absorb its own losses, the shutdown is causing a severe crisis for its network of smaller suppliers, many of whom face potential bankruptcy and are already laying off staff. The situation has prompted calls for the UK government to establish a furlough scheme to prevent widespread job losses throughout the automotive supply chain. The disruption highlights the vulnerability of interconnected manufacturing ecosystems to digital threats.</p>

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled the development of its all-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, attributing the decision to slowing consumer demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in North America. The company had previously delayed the truck's launch, which was originally slated for late 2024. Instead of a full BEV, Ram will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, which will feature a gasoline engine alongside an electric generator.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will be sending National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of his administration's strategy to address violent crime in cities led by Democratic mayors.

This move is consistent with the administration's previous deployments of the National Guard to other cities like Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

Gingles, her father, and a neighbor were killed in the attack. The case has drawn intense scrutiny over law enforcement's failure to use Florida's red flag laws to disarm the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-sharing company systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit claims Uber routinely denies service to passengers with service animals or stowable mobility devices, and unlawfully charges fees related to these issues. This legal action seeks to force Uber to modify its policies, train its drivers on ADA compliance, and pay damages to affected riders. Uber has stated that it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials.</p>

The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who argue the target is no longer feasible due to challenges like high costs, lack of charging infrastructure, and intense competition from Chinese EV manufacturers. Carmakers are calling for a relaxation of the rules to allow for other low-emission technologies, such as hybrids, beyond the 2035 deadline.
