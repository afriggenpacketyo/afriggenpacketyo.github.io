          <p>Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice suggested that the UK should learn from Dubai's strong national pride and low crime levels, citing his frequent visits to the UAE to see his partner, journalist Isabel Oakeshott. Tice praised Dubai's education system for instilling pride in the country and argued that politicians are ignoring lessons from countries that are "getting it right." He acknowledged Dubai is not "perfect" but criticized the current state of Britain, citing high crime rates and ineffective justice. Tice also expressed his ambition to become chancellor if Nigel Farage were to become prime minister, highlighting his experience in dealing with money in his business career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Vladimir Bortun, a Romanian political scientist, discusses the rise of far-right politics in Romania, highlighting the likelihood of George Simion, a self-described Trumpist, becoming the country’s next president. Bortun attributes this rise to decades of economic failure, including chronic underdevelopment, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, which have fueled anti-establishment anger. He criticizes mainstream parties for failing to address the broken economic model and emphasizes that both Simion and his opponent, Nicusor Dan, ultimately support the business class and have no plans to alter the country’s fundamental economic framework. The article underscores the urgent need for a political project that offers a genuine alternative to the status quo, as Romania risks falling into an abyss of economic insecurity.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly seeking new migrant deals with Balkan countries after Albania rejected Prime Minister Starmer's plan to deport asylum seekers, with Bosnia, Serbia, and North Macedonia potentially acting as return hubs. The Financial Times reports that Britain's economy experienced its fastest growth in a year during the first quarter, providing a boost to Labour before potential impacts from US President Trump's tariffs. Additionally, UK ministers are planning to block bonuses for Thames Water bosses due to the company's financial struggles. The Daily Telegraph highlights a government initiative to teach children "grit" in schools to address the growing mental health crisis among young people.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law allowing preemptive cyberdefense measures, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. The law obliges key infrastructure operators in sectors like electricity and railways to report cyber breaches. This move aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations, with a goal of full operational readiness by 2027. An independent panel will provide prior approval for data acquisition and actions, ensuring government surveillance is properly conducted and personal rights are upheld.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports, according to preliminary government data. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports dropping by 0.6% and subtracting 0.8 percentage points from the GDP. Despite the export slump, domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% and adding 0.7 percentage points to the GDP. The data emerges as Japan engages in trade negotiations with the U.S., with warnings of downside risks from U.S. trade policies impacting the economy.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant in Florida faces a $1.82 million fine for not leaving the U.S. after a 2005 removal order, according to CBS News. The woman, a mother of three U.S. citizens, is being charged $500 for each day she has remained in the country since the order was issued. Her attorney argues that the woman is eligible to apply for U.S. residency due to her long-term residence and the hardship her deportation would cause her children. The case highlights the enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which has historically been rarely enforced.</p>

The defense presented text messages suggesting Ventura's willing participation, but she maintained they were "just words" and that she sometimes initiated the acts out of fear. Ventura also testified that she and Combs used drugs extensively throughout their relationship, and that she often felt jealous due to Combs' involvement with other women.</p>

          <p>A strike by New Jersey Transit rail engineers has begun, shutting down the rail network and disrupting the commutes of tens of thousands of people in the New York City metropolitan region. The union, representing about 450 locomotive engineers, initiated the walkout over a dispute regarding pay raises, demanding to be paid on par with their counterparts at Amtrak and other commuter railroads. NJ Transit's bus system continues to operate, and private buses have been hired as substitutes, but these can only accommodate a fraction of the displaced train riders. Commuters are urged to work from home, and major employers are offering flexibility to their workers to ease the expected transit jams.</p>

While a recent climbdown in superpower tensions has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs, economists say that Europe must quickly adapt to Washington’s efforts to reorder trade with China and the rest of the world. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.</p>

          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a significant drop of 7.6% after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported earnings that fell short of expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter. Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, the company's net income missed analyst targets due to losses from subsidiary disposals. Macroeconomic volatility and the trade war between Washington and Beijing have affected consumer sentiment in China, impacting Alibaba's performance. The company is investing in artificial intelligence and its core e-commerce business, including an "instant commerce" model, to differentiate itself from rivals in an intensely competitive market.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Trump administration for a social media post that officials claim amounted to a call for President Trump’s assassination. The post, which featured seashells forming the numbers “86 47,” was interpreted by some as a reference to dismissing or removing Trump from office. Despite Comey's removal of the post and explanation that he did not intend it as a call for violence, high-level officials have denounced the message, with some calling for his imprisonment. The incident reflects ongoing tensions between Comey and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Nissan is open to sharing factories around the world with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as it shakes up its business amid struggling sales. The Japanese firm, which employs thousands of people in the UK, said it could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally." This comes as Nissan plans to lay off 11,000 workers and shut seven factories as part of a cost-saving effort. Nissan has partnered with Beijing-controlled Dongfeng for over 20 years, currently working together to build cars in Wuhan, China.</p>

          <p>Lawyers increasingly seek out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges to litigate divisive political issues, leading to a rise in venue shopping, according to a CBS News analysis. Conservatives often file challenges against the Biden administration in small Texas courts with Republican-appointed judges, while liberals have filed cases against the Trump administration in larger venues within the 9th and 1st Circuits. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country through a nationwide injunction. The Judicial Conference has recommended a random case-assignment policy to limit judge shopping.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing the world’s fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections indicating up to 115 million cases by 2050. In 1990, the country had about 4 million patients with dementia, a number that rose to 17 million by 2021, according to research published in PLOS One. The study did not highlight a specific reason for this increase, but the country is already grappling with a range of challenges caused by its rapidly ageing population a nd this trend threatens to compound the problem. The study found that the incidence, prevalence and mortality rates of dementia cases had doubled globally between 1990 and 2021, but over the same period the number of cases rose threefold in China.</p>

Traditional crab fishing ropes have harmed numerous whales, leading to the adoption of a high-tech system involving remote-controlled pop-up devices that minimize rope usage. Fisherman Brand Little has been using this experimental device, sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and has not injured any whales. The technology faces criticism due to cost and tradition, but it allows some fishermen to continue fishing while protecting whales.</p>
