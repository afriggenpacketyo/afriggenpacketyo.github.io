          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has confirmed that Labour MPs have privately encouraged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party's leadership. While stating he is not actively plotting a return to Westminster, the former MP did not rule out a future leadership bid, creating tension ahead of the Labour Party conference. To mount a challenge, Burnham would first need to be elected as an MP, a process with no clear or immediate path. His comments have been dismissed by some party figures as "tittle tattle," who emphasize the need for unity after a recent election victory.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to India has publicly stated that the long-standing boundary dispute between the two nations, a "legacy of history," should not define their overall relationship or impede cooperation. Speaking at an event, the envoy emphasized the need for a long-term strategic vision and resolving differences through dialogue for peaceful coexistence. This call for strengthened multilateral cooperation and friendly exchanges comes as both countries navigate complex trade relations and tariffs with the United States. The statement aims to de-escalate tensions and focus on broader shared interests.</p>

          <p>The Spanish island of Mallorca is on track for a record number of visitors this year, despite increasing local opposition and protests against mass tourism. The influx of tourists is causing significant strain on infrastructure, leading to traffic congestion and overburdened public services. While the tourism numbers appear high, local businesses report a decline in sales, partly attributed to a drop in German visitors who may be deterred by the protests and rising prices. The regional government has so far hesitated to implement measures to limit tourism, fearing economic repercussions from its largest industry.</p>

The broader Topix index also achieved a new all-time high, signaling strong investor confidence in the Japanese economy. This performance contrasted with mixed results across other Asia-Pacific markets, where some indices fell following a sell-off in U.S. tech stocks like Nvidia. The positive momentum in Japan reflects a robust domestic market environment even as global economic conditions show signs of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled a new "Presidential Walk of Fame" at the White House, featuring portraits of all past presidents except for his predecessor, Joe Biden. In place of a standard portrait, Trump has installed a photograph of an autopen signing Biden's name, a pointed reference to his unsubstantiated claims about Biden's cognitive state during his term. This act is the latest in a series of efforts by Trump to delegitimize his predecessor and follows numerous design changes he has made to the White House. The display continues the incumbent's pattern of challenging established political norms and traditions.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced a downturn, led by a slide in medical technology company shares, after the United States launched a national security investigation into imports of medical devices. The probe, conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, could potentially lead to new tariffs on a wide range of products from surgical masks to pacemakers. This development has renewed concerns about U.S. trade policy and its impact on global supply chains, causing investor uncertainty in the affected sectors.

          <p>The British government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) following a major cyber-attack that has halted the carmaker's production. The attack forced JLR to shut down its IT systems, and its factories will remain closed until at least October, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week. There are growing fears that smaller suppliers, who rely heavily on JLR, could face bankruptcy without assistance. One potential government intervention being considered is buying component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms until production resumes.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are just one win away from securing another National League West division championship after a 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game featured an unconventional strategy, with starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw making successful scoreless relief appearances to support a struggling bullpen. After squandering a lead in the eighth inning, the Dodgers rallied, with Tommy Edman driving in the winning run in the 11th. The team's resilience and tactical flexibility were key to grinding out the crucial win.</p>

          <p>Leaders of major banks in the U.K., including Barclays, Citi, and J.P. Morgan, are urging the government to provide greater policy clarity and stability ahead of the upcoming Autumn Budget. They expressed concern that potential new tax hikes, such as a rumored bank windfall tax, could stifle investment, harm competition, and damage London's standing as a global financial hub. They stressed that a consistent and predictable approach to regulation and taxation is crucial for the financial services sector to remain competitive and continue to grow. The calls come as the government seeks to address a significant deficit in public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, has intensified discussions among Gulf and other Islamic nations about forming a collective security pact, sometimes dubbed an "Islamic NATO." The attack, which targeted Hamas members, has shaken assumptions in the Gulf about the reliability of U.S. security guarantees and is pushing regional powers toward greater strategic autonomy. In response, Gulf Cooperation Council members activated a joint defense clause, and Saudi Arabia entered a mutual defense agreement with Pakistan. While a formal NATO-style alliance is considered unrealistic, the incident is accelerating efforts toward enhanced intelligence sharing and military cooperation.</p>

          <p>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has condemned recent U.S. airstrikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, calling them an "act of tyranny" and "murder." In an interview, Petro questioned the necessity of using lethal force when vessels could be intercepted and crews arrested, a method he says has been used for years without fatalities. The strikes, which have reportedly killed 17 people, have been justified by the Trump administration as necessary to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Petro called for criminal proceedings against U.S. officials if investigations confirm Colombian nationals were killed.</p>

          <p>A White House memo has indicated that if the U.S. government shuts down on October 1, the administration plans to issue "reduction in force" notices to permanently eliminate some federal jobs, rather than just temporarily furloughing employees. The Office of Management and Budget memo states that a funding lapse would provide an opportunity to cut positions in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This marks a significant departure from past shutdowns and is seen by Democratic leaders as an "attempt at intimidation" amid tense budget negotiations. The proposal escalates the political stakes as the funding deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>According to an MSNBC report, former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in a Virginia federal court within days. While the full scope of the charges is unclear, they are believed to relate to accusations that he lied to Congress in 2020 testimony. The potential indictment follows the recent resignation of the interim U.S. Attorney for the district, who reportedly opposed bringing charges, and his replacement by a lawyer who has previously represented President Trump. Comey has been a long-standing target of the president since being fired in 2017, and the statute of limitations on the potential charges is set to expire soon.</p>

The move expands the administration's use of trade protectionism and could lead to higher costs for manufacturers, hospitals, and consumers.
