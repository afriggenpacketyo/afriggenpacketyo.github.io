          <p>The White House announced a trade deal with China following weekend negotiations, but specifics remain unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the talks as 'productive' and promised a detailed briefing soon. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer hailed the discussions as 'very constructive,' suggesting that the differences between the two countries were not as significant as previously thought. Chinese officials also expressed optimism, with Vice Premier He Lifeng noting 'substantial progress and important consensus.' The agreement aims to establish a consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S. due to claims of government-sponsored race-based discrimination, departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C. This initiative follows President Trump's executive order to resettle Afrikaners, descendants of European colonists, who allege racially motivated seizures of land. South Africa's government has denied these claims, viewing the resettlement as politically motivated. The State Department has stated it is prioritizing the resettlement of Afrikaners who are victims of unjust racial discrimination, despite halting most other refugee arrivals to the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump implored Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, diverging from a European plan that insisted on a cease-fire first. This occurred after European leaders set a deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. Ukrainian President Zelensky responded cautiously, reiterating the need for a halt in fighting but adding that he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey. The flurry of exchanges followed Russia's rejection of the cease-fire deadline, proposing direct talks in Istanbul instead, with Trump backing the Russian counteroffer.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to overhaul the UK's immigration system with stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Migrants will need to wait ten years instead of five to apply for settlement, but a fast-track will be available for nurses, engineers, and AI experts. The government also plans to end care worker recruitment from overseas, requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend existing visas. Critics warn the rules may split families, but research suggests migrants consider language important. Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University Migration Observatory says the ten-year route would make the UK more restrictive than most high-income countries.</p>

The article highlights the starkly different visions of Israel's future represented by Sharvit, who believes the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, and the peace activist, who advocates for co-existence with Palestinians.

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane carrying White South Africans, claiming discrimination, departed for the United States, welcomed as refugees by the Trump administration. This contrasts with the administration's halting of refugee admissions from other countries. The Afrikaners say they have been denied jobs and targeted by violence due to their race. This initiative has deepened tensions between South Africa and the United States, with South African officials viewing the refugee status as a politically motivated attempt to discredit the country. White South Africans own farmland that covers about half of the country, indicative of a broader prosperity gap.</p>

The administration plans to retrofit the plane for official presidential use. The Boeing 747-8 jet will be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the end of his second term. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that any gift given by a foreign government is accepted in compliance with all applicable laws. Trump struck a deal during his first term to modernize two Boeing 747s to be used as the new Air Force One aircraft, but the project has faced delays and cost overruns.</p>

If Trump accepts the plane, it will be transferred to the U.S. Air Force to meet specifications for presidential travel.

          <p>The author argues that President Trump's Special Education Simplified Funding Program, part of his 2026 budget proposal, threatens the education of students with disabilities by limiting federal oversight and providing states with greater flexibility. The author points to the case of a student in Oklahoma placed in segregated classrooms, highlighting the potential for uneven enforcement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Before federal oversight, many states chose not to educate children with disabilities at all. Without robust federal oversight, the author warns that enforcement on the local level would continue to be uneven.</p>

King Charles III's reign is shaping up as both eventful and oddly unchanging in its core narrative: that of a beleaguered father managing a messy brood. Harry’s emotional plea to be reconciled with his family — made in a recent interview with the BBC, in which he mused about how long his cancer-stricken father had left to live — resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed.</p>
