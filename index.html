          <p>The United States is revoking all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders, citing the African nation's failure to accept its nationals expelled from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the decision, stating that every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner. This action marks the first instance of singling out all passport holders from a particular country since Donald Trump returned to the White House, reflecting a stricter stance on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>China's economic relationship with Africa is undergoing a transformation, marked by increased trade and evolving investment strategies. In 2024, trade between China and Africa saw a nearly 5% increase, driven by initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. China's approach is shifting towards public-private partnerships and engaging financial institutions for project funding, while trade is diversifying with Africa exporting more non-resource goods to China. This evolution reflects a broader shift in global alliances and economic power dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has placed an attorney on leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a case involving a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, was reportedly placed on leave for 'failure to zealously advocate' for the government's interests, with Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasizing the requirement for DOJ attorneys to advocate strongly on behalf of the United States. The deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation was also placed on leave for failure to supervise a subordinate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs marks a significant departure from the free trade policies that have underpinned US economic strength for decades, potentially leading to messy consequences. The tariffs, which take the US back a century in terms of protectionism, target countries with trade surpluses, regardless of their trade barriers, based on the idea that selling more to the US constitutes 'cheating.' While the policy aims to reshore manufacturing jobs, it risks alienating global consumers and disrupting supply chains, leading to a social media trade war and potential economic fallout for the US.</p>

          <p>A family has been awarded damages after NHS cancer screening reporting errors led to the death of a mother from cervical cancer. Louise Gleadell's cervical screening results were misreported as negative in both 2008 and 2012, meaning a four-year window for treating pre-cancerous cells was missed. An internal review in 2017 found the samples were inadequate, but neither Ms. Gleadell nor her relatives were informed of the situation while she was alive. The trust has apologized for the mistakes, highlighting the devastating consequences of the errors.</p>
