          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, reducing the total force by half. These troops were federalized by President Trump over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom to address protests related to federal immigration enforcement. While the administration claims the withdrawal is possible because "lawlessness is subsiding," Governor Newsom criticized the initial deployment as a political maneuver and called for the remaining troops to be sent home. The deployment had sparked a legal battle over presidential authority to federalize state guards without gubernatorial consent.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation would define stablecoins legally and establish consumer protections, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own versions. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, positioning them as "digital dollars." The push is part of a broader effort by some lawmakers and the Trump administration to support the cryptocurrency industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an article published in the Communist Party's leading journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's support for economic globalization and free trade. He spoke out against rising unilateralism and protectionism, specifically opposing trade barriers and unilateral sanctions. The article compiles statements made by Xi since 2012, positioning China as a champion of an open global economy in contrast to the more protectionist policies of other nations. Xi also pledged that China would uphold "genuine multilateralism" to promote an inclusive and beneficial global economic system for all participants.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged local governments in China to use their legislative powers to stimulate economic development. It argues that tailored local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since legislative powers were expanded to more cities in 2015, local lawmaking has become a crucial tool for governance, shifting from top-down directives to a more systemic approach. The article emphasizes that successful local legislation must adapt to the evolving needs of economic and social development.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering effort to save Florida's dying coral reefs, marine scientists are crossbreeding native Elkhorn coral with a hardier strain from Honduras. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming oceans and disease, threatening coastal protection from storm surges. The Honduran coral, accustomed to tougher conditions, was brought to Florida labs to create a hybrid "Flonduran" species, which has now been planted on wild reefs for the first time. Scientists hope this new, more resilient coral can survive future marine heatwaves and serve as a critical step in scaling up reef restoration efforts.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service is facing scrutiny over its management of a wildfire that destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 70 other structures on the North Rim. The fire, ignited by lightning, was initially allowed to burn under a "confine and contain" strategy, with officials stating it posed no threat. However, the blaze grew explosively due to hot, windy conditions, forcing immediate evacuations days later. Arizona's governor has called for a federal investigation into the decision-making process, questioning why the fire was managed as a controlled burn during the hottest and driest part of the summer.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June indicated a 2.7% annual inflation rate, the highest since February and an increase from the previous month's 2.4% reading. On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.3%, driven partly by a 0.9% increase in energy costs. Food prices saw a significant 3% annual rise, with items like eggs and beef experiencing double-digit increases. Economists suggest the data shows early signs of recent tariffs impacting consumer prices, though core inflation, which excludes food and energy, remained slightly below forecasts at 2.9%.

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are purchasing gold directly from domestic mines instead of on the international market.

This method is often cheaper, supports the local mining industry, and helps formalize a sector sometimes linked to illegal practices. Countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines are using this approach to build reserves amid soaring gold prices and global geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

In an emotional return, King surveyed the stump and the new green shoots, calling the vandalism "absolutely mindless."</p>

          <h2>UK Review Suggests New Title for Physician Associates to Avoid Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors. It concluded that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles has led to confusion about their purpose and scope of practice. The recommendations follow concerns from families of patients who died after being treated by PAs whom they believed were fully qualified doctors.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. The iconic Victorian glasshouse, which opened in 1848, requires extensive repairs as the hot, humid conditions inside have caused its ironwork to rust. The ambitious makeover will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, temporarily relocating 1,300 tropical plants, and upgrading the heating system to achieve net-zero emissions. Horticulturists have already begun the complex process of propagating and moving the priceless plant collection in preparation for the extensive restoration work.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its products can help people feel calm and reduce anxiety. The watchdog found that claims about the beverage's "Mindful Blend" of ingredients, including magnesium and ashwagandha, were not on the official register of permitted health claims for food products. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" would lead consumers to infer a prohibited health benefit. The company was ordered not to make claims that its drinks could prevent, treat, or cure human disease.</p>

          <p>Julian Smith, a former Northern Ireland Secretary, has sharply criticized former Prime Minister David Cameron for his handling of the 2016 Brexit referendum, describing it as "extremely cavalier." Smith argued that it was unforgivable to put such a fundamental question to the public without a clear plan for either outcome, especially given the complexities of the Irish border. He told the BBC that the referendum was treated like "some sort of Eton game," leading to years of political turmoil as the UK struggled to find a solution.

          <p>A Seoul court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family argues he was a patriot who acted to prevent bloodshed and restore democracy, not a traitor seeking power. The retrial, granted 46 years later, will re-examine whether his actions constituted treason, particularly in light of evidence that his original conviction in a military court was based on a flawed process and testimony obtained through torture. The case revisits a pivotal and deeply divisive moment in the nation's history.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, alleging he misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff, a long-time political adversary of Trump, dismissed the accusation as a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and an effort to distract from other issues. Trump cited a Fannie Mae investigation, but a memo from the agency only noted "possible occupancy misrepresentation" and did not conclude a crime was committed. A spokesperson for Schiff stated that the senator has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and Maryland and followed all laws.</p>

This comment serves as a clarification following reports that he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call if Kyiv's forces *could* hit Moscow and St. Petersburg. The White House had previously claimed those reports took the president's words out of context, stating he was asking a question, not encouraging an attack.

This call for clarity comes amid growing frustration from some Republican lawmakers and Trump's base over the Justice Department's conclusion that no such list exists.

The judge sided with a credit union league that argued the CFPB had overstepped its authority.

This increase has occurred even as the city's overall violent crime and homicide rates are dropping. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell attributed the uptick in part to more encounters with suspects armed with firearms or replica weapons, which complicates threat assessment for officers. The trend has drawn concern from police oversight officials, who noted the rise in shootings is a troubling development amid otherwise falling crime statistics.</p>
