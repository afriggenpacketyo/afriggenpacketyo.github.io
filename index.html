          <p>Connecticut Representative Jim Himes condemned the Trump administration's pressure on the Federal Reserve, labeling key officials as "hucksters" and con artists. He argued that firing the Fed Chair would trigger massive market instability and that claims of tariffs being paid by foreign countries are false. Himes also addressed threats against public figures like Jay Powell, stemming from what he described as dangerous political rhetoric. The discussion also covered accusations of treason against former officials by the Director of National Intelligence, which Himes dismissed as a baseless and dangerous lie.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described a climate of fear gripping the city's immigrant communities due to ongoing federal immigration raids. She stated that the crackdown, which has seen an increase in arrests of migrants with no criminal convictions, has left many residents afraid to leave their homes. Bass criticized the tactics of federal agents, including the use of unmarked cars and masks, which she said resemble kidnappings and undermine public trust. While acknowledging the administration's help during recent wildfires, she asserted that the immigration policies have been purely punitive and have created a "reign of terror."</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to remain in office despite exit polls indicating his ruling coalition is poised to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election results reflect public frustration over rising prices, potential U.S. tariffs, and a series of political scandals that have plagued the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Analysts suggest a significant loss could force Ishiba to step down, potentially destabilizing the government during critical trade negotiations. The outcome is also seen as a reflection of shifting support within the conservative base toward more right-wing parties.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Speaking on Sunday, Burchett emphasized the need for transparency but cautioned against exposing the identities of victims or other innocent individuals. He pushed back against President Trump's characterization of the demands as "foolish," stating that while he was annoyed by the comment, he remains focused on the issue. Burchett expressed guarded optimism about Attorney General Pam Bondi's recent move to unseal grand jury evidence, calling it a start but doubting the full truth will ever be revealed.</p>

          <p>A new peace declaration signed between the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group is being met with skepticism from experts.

Analysts point out that the success of the deal hinges on genuine political will and effective implementation, noting that previous agreements have failed to bring lasting peace to the region.</p>

          <p>The Cadillac Northstar V8 engine is widely known for significant reliability issues, primarily stemming from head gasket failures in early models. The core problem involved steel head bolts stripping the threads in the aluminum engine block, leading to coolant leaks and loss of compression. While General Motors made several revisions over the years, with a major fix implemented around 2004, the engine's reputation for expensive and complex repairs was already cemented. Later supercharged versions, like the 4.4-liter LC3, were substantially re-engineered and proved much more reliable, but the damage to the Northstar brand was ultimately irreversible.</p>

          <p>A series of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia led to the temporary closure of Moscow's major airports, causing the cancellation of at least 140 flights and the redirection of over 130 more. The Russian defense ministry reported downing more than 230 drones across the country, with 27 intercepted over the capital region. Meanwhile, Russian air strikes in Ukraine resulted in at least three fatalities. The disruption to Russian air travel highlights the escalating nature of the conflict, as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that President Putin is ready for a peace settlement but remains focused on achieving Moscow's military goals.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting could occur either on the sidelines of the summit or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. This development follows recent efforts by both nations to stabilize relations after a period of tension marked by threats of heavy tariffs. A preliminary trade deal and a recent face-to-face meeting between their top diplomats have paved the way for this potential high-level discussion.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that traditional job metrics like the unemployment rate are becoming obsolete in today's complex economy. The author contends that with the rise of the "over-employed," side gigs, and remote work, focusing on "jobs" is misleading. Instead, the article proposes measuring the labor market by income, suggesting a new metric that tracks how many working-age Americans earn above a certain threshold, adjusted for inflation. This approach would provide a more accurate picture of economic health than current government surveys, which are often subject to large revisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a comeback as the famous highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by a new interstate in the 1970s. Now, local residents and business owners are planning events, tours, and improvements to capitalize on the expected influx of tourists for the centennial. They aim to transform their town, known for the iconic Bagdad Cafe, into a key destination while preserving its unique, "frozen in time" rural character.</p>

The coach, carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School on their way back from a zoo trip, left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope. Two children and two adults are still receiving hospital treatment for their injuries. The school was closed as the community mourned, leaving flowers and tributes at the gates, while local fundraisers have collected over £40,000 to support those affected by the horrific incident.</p>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza are voicing increasing mistrust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure their release. Campaigners feel the government is not prioritizing a deal with Hamas, pointing to the deaths of hostages who could have been freed in earlier agreements. Many now place more hope in the U.S. administration to pressure Netanyahu into a deal. The families' frustration is compounded by what they see as a government more focused on political goals, influenced by far-right coalition partners, than on the sacred Israeli ethos of not leaving anyone behind.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan condemnation for circumventing a 2021 law by restoring the Confederate names of several U.S. Army bases. To bypass the law, which mandated new names, Hegseth claims the bases are now named after different historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. The House Armed Services Committee, with some Republican support, voted to block this move, calling it an insult and a blatant effort to defy Congress. The original Confederate figures were often controversial, including the notoriously incompetent and widely disliked General Braxton Bragg.</p>

The author reflects on growing up with a sanitized version of state history that celebrated land runs while ignoring the violent dispossession of Indigenous nations and the racial terror that followed. The piece explores the state's cycle of reinvention, from its origins in land theft to its modern efforts to attract new talent. It concludes that Oklahoma's story of ambition, betrayal, and colliding dreams offers an unvarnished and essential portrait of the American experience.</p>

Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is struggling to effectively counter Donald Trump, whom she says ran on a platform of rolling back progress.
