            <p>Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced that Israeli troops will remain in Gaza buffer zones even after the war concludes, a move resembling strategies employed in Lebanon and Syria. This decision follows Hamas's rejection of an Israeli-proposed ceasefire deal, citing disarmament demands as a political trap. The buffer zones, constituting 30% of Gaza, aim to create a security perimeter between the enemy and Israeli communities, while international institutions condemn Israel's operations, particularly regarding humanitarian aid blockades. The Israeli U.N. Ambassador insists the war will continue until all hostages are returned home. Optimism score: 30</p>

Trump criticized Powell for being "TOO LATE AND WRONG," contrasting the Fed's actions with the European Central Bank's rate cuts. He argued that lower oil prices, reduced grocery costs, and tariff revenue justify rate reductions.

            <p>China is increasing its oversight of driver-assistance systems in electric vehicles, following a fatal accident involving a Xiaomi EV. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has cautioned companies against exaggerating the capabilities of these systems. Carmakers and tech firms are now required to obtain approval before conducting mass testing of self-driving technologies or performing over-the-air software updates. These measures aim to regulate the market and ensure driver awareness of the limitations of autonomous driving. Optimism score: 65</p>

The company claimed the tree posed a health and safety risk based on expert advice, but Enfield Council has reported the incident as criminal damage.

            <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that President Trump's tariff-heavy trade agenda resembles a "corrupt scheme" to enrich administration officials and loyalists. They argue that the administration's rollout of new tariffs provides opportunities for undue influence. The lawmakers have sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, requesting details on plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for self-dealing. As the minority party, Democrats have limited power to compel a response. Optimism score: 30</p>
