            <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleging he is an MS-13 gang member and a threat to national security, despite a court order protecting Garcia from deportation. Homan cited the Alien Enemies Act as justification for limiting due process rights in such cases. Sen. Chris Van Hollen criticized Homan's claims, asserting that defending due process rights is essential, even for those accused of gang affiliation, and accused the Trump administration of lying about the case to distract from questions about whether his rights were violated. The Supreme Court has ordered the administration to "facilitate" Garcia's return to the U.S., creating a legal and political conflict.</p>

            <p>Representative Jasmine Crockett faced backlash for stating that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deported illegal immigrant, is "a lot less criminal" than former President Donald Trump. Crockett made the comments during an interview where she also teared up while being praised for her support for democracy. Critics on social media called her remarks a "clown show" and labeled her a "complete lunatic."

            <p>The Guardian argues for a renewed youth exchange scheme between the UK and the EU, highlighting the cultural and educational benefits lost after Brexit. The editorial notes that the cancellation of the UK’s membership of the Erasmus student exchange programme has made the UK more isolated from its neighbors. It suggests that a rebranded "youth opportunity scheme" would be a positive step, facilitating travel and study abroad for young citizens. The piece urges Sir Keir Starmer to embrace the idea as a signal of closer cooperation with Europe.</p>

            <p>The Israeli military acknowledged "professional failures" in the deaths of 15 Palestinian paramedics in Gaza, following an internal investigation into the March incident. The investigation found breaches of orders and operational misunderstanding by the troops, attributing the killings to poor night visibility and a breach of orders during combat. While Israel claims six of the victims were Hamas members, they did not provide evidence to back this up, and the incident sparked international criticism and condemnation from human rights organizations.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Ukrainian front lines had been hit by more than 46 Russian assaults since the start of the day on Sunday, while Russia's defense ministry said it had "repelled" attempted assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Zelensky dismissed Putin's truce declaration as a "PR" exercise, while the Russian defense ministry insisted its troops had "strictly observed the ceasefire".</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project, a massive natural gas project, to potentially mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs and secure trade deals. The project, which has been stalled for years, is now being touted by Trump as a national priority. The Alaska LNG project would involve building a pipeline, a gas processing plant, and a liquefaction plant, with the goal of exporting LNG to Asia. The Trump administration views the project as strategically important, offering a direct route for LNG exports to Japan and South Korea.</p>

Trump's tariffs on Chinese-made electronics led to increased sales. The CEO sees an opportunity for Americans to change their consumption habits and prioritize used devices to avoid tariffs. While analysts predict a short-term boost for used devices, they believe most consumers will eventually return to buying new tech when affordable.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, responding to an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court directed the Trump administration to halt removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice. The ACLU argued that the administration was attempting to restart removals under the AEA without providing detainees a chance to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, while the White House claimed the detainees were "foreign terrorists."</p>

The author argues that there is little empirical evidence to support these metrics and that even economic data from government and trade associations can be unreliable. Instead, the author suggests focusing on actual data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies to gauge the health of the economy.
