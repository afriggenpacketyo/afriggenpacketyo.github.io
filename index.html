          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity, led by President Maia Sandu, has secured an early lead in parliamentary elections, with 78% of votes counted. Sandu had previously warned of significant Russian interference, highlighting the election's importance for the country's EU aspirations. The vote was marked by bomb scares at polling stations and claims of illicit funding and disinformation, which pro-Moscow parties denied. Despite challenges, the election saw a higher turnout, signaling a critical juncture for Moldova's democratic future.</p>

This surpasses a previous record set in August and contributes to the over 33,000 crossings since the start of 2025. The crossings continue despite increased French resources and UK financial support, with Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood vowing to restore order to the immigration system. The tragic event also follows the discovery of another migrant's body on a French beach, raising the death toll for illegal crossings this year to at least 27.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the fatal shooting at a Michigan Mormon church appeared to be "yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America." In a Truth Social post, Trump announced he had been briefed, the FBI was leading the investigation, and the suspect was dead. He urged prayers for victims and their families, stating the "epidemic of violence" must end. This statement follows a similar deadly incident at a Catholic church last month.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's gubernatorial race was disrupted after the National Archives mistakenly released Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's unredacted military records, including her Social Security number. Sherrill and her Democratic allies allege this was a deliberate act by the Trump administration to weaponize federal agencies against political opponents. While the records show an unblemished Navy career, her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, raised concerns about her past involvement in a 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal, which Sherrill claims is a 30-year-old, widely reported incident.</p>

          <p>A new executive order by President Trump aims to democratize access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors, potentially changing retirement accounts. While proponents suggest diversification benefits, experts warn of risks due to the illiquid and opaque nature of private assets, which could create systemic financial instability. Financial advisors recommend caution, suggesting a small allocation of 5-10% for those keen to explore. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

          <p>Aston Villa achieved their first Premier League victory of the season, beating Fulham after a dramatic comeback that saw them score three goals in the second half.

This win, following a Europa League victory, aims to be a catalyst for recovery, as Villa remains five points off the top four.</p>

          <p>The NBA is investigating Clippers owner Steve Ballmer over allegations that the team circumvented the league's salary cap by funneling $21 million to star Kawhi Leonard through a sustainability firm in which Ballmer was an investor. Ballmer denies wrongdoing, asserting his investment predated Leonard's endorsement deal and that he wasn't involved in its details. The probe, which could lead to severe penalties like suspensions or draft pick forfeitures, centers on whether the Clippers knowingly violated rules to pay Leonard beyond his maximum salary.</p>

          <p>Rural Americans, crucial to Trump's election victories, are worried about the future of the federally funded Head Start program, which provides essential childcare and support services. Despite bipartisan support, Head Start has faced federal funding freezes, staff reductions, and delayed payments under the Trump administration, leading to temporary closures and layoffs. For many rural communities, Head Start is the sole childcare option, a significant employer, and a vital source of community connection, making its potential cuts deeply impactful.</p>
