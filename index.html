          <h2>Film Review Assesses Dwayne Johnson's Dramatic Turn in UFC Biopic 'The Smashing Machine'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 09:42:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review evaluates "The Smashing Machine," a gritty A24 biopic where Dwayne Johnson portrays MMA legend Mark Kerr. The article highlights Johnson's transformative performance as Kerr, a dominant fighter in the early days of the UFC who grappled with a severe opioid addiction. While praising Johnson's dramatic range and suggesting it could earn him Oscar consideration, the review finds the overall film emotionally lacking compared to director Benny Safdie's previous work. The film is ultimately recommended as a worthwhile watch for fans of Johnson and UFC, primarily due to the strength of its lead actor's performance.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a fatal attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue, Greater Manchester Police have significantly increased their presence to reassure local communities. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed that hundreds of extra officers are on the streets, with some working 12-hour shifts and having rest days canceled. The attack, which killed two men and was carried out by a knifeman who was subsequently shot dead by police, has prompted a major security response. Six individuals remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly fired Jon Harrison, the navy's chief of staff, who was appointed in January. Harrison was reportedly a key figure in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the Pentagon's policy and budgeting offices, working with Navy Secretary John Phelan to limit the influence of the navy under secretary. This dismissal follows the recent confirmation of Hung Cao as the new navy under secretary and is part of a larger pattern of upheaval under Hegseth's leadership. The administration has seen numerous high-level military officials fired in recent months.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate the FBI is contemplating a "showy" arrest and perp walk for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted for lying to Congress. This potential move comes despite his lawyers agreeing to bring him to his scheduled arraignment. An FBI supervisory special agent was reportedly suspended for insubordination after refusing to assemble a team for the arrest, viewing it as inappropriate for a white-collar defendant. The situation highlights the deep-seated political tensions between former President Trump and Comey, with the indictment following public pressure from the White House.</p>

          <p>The Chinese military has disclosed a previously unreported incident from last year where one of its J-16 fighter jets successfully expelled two foreign stealth fighters from its airspace. According to the pilot, Li, the foreign aircraft were on a provocative course toward Chinese territorial waters. Li described performing aggressive maneuvers, including a barrel roll that brought him within 10 to 15 meters of one of the jets.

          <p>Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona was not sworn into office this week by House Speaker Mike Johnson, leaving her unable to officially begin her duties. Grijalva, who won a special election to fill her late father's seat, speculates the delay is politically motivated. She intends to provide the final signature on a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing files related to the accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, a move opposed by the Speaker and former President Trump. A spokesperson for Johnson indicated she will be sworn in when the House returns to session, which is currently stalled due to a government funding dispute.</p>

          <p>This opinion article raises concerns about the increasing criminalization of pregnancy in the United States following the overturning of Roe v Wade. It cites new research showing that prosecutors in 16 states have charged 412 people with pregnancy-related offenses, often involving substance use allegations against low-income women. The author argues these prosecutions are expanding the legal concept of "fetal personhood," which could lead to greater surveillance and punishment for any behavior deemed dangerous during pregnancy. The piece draws a parallel to El Salvador's total abortion ban, warning it could serve as a model for a more repressive future in the U.S.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's recent Supreme Court opinions argues that her powerful dissents are intended as a stark warning about the state of American democracy and the rule of law. The article points to her sharp criticism of the conservative majority's rulings, which she argues grant the executive branch unchecked power, and her notable citation of a book on the legal structure of Nazi Germany. Despite facing criticism from her conservative colleagues, Jackson has become the court's most frequent dissenter. Her writings are framed as an effort to speak directly to the American people and lower court judges about perceived threats to the nation's governing institutions.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advocates for a simple yet profound parenting practice: creating an email address for each child at birth. She uses these inboxes to send messages, stories, and photos, capturing everything from birthday milestones to small, everyday moments and even reflections during difficult times. This practice serves as both a personal journal for the parent and a digital time capsule for the child. The expert suggests this collection of memories and expressions of love can be a powerful gift for the child to receive later in life, particularly on a milestone birthday or during a major life transition.</p>

Despite Bill Gates calling it "the stupidest decision," Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's vision and customer-centric obsession. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it ultimately surpassed a year early. Risher, who became Amazon's 37th employee, was instrumental in expanding the company into new categories like music and movies, illustrating the high-risk, high-reward nature of early tech startups.</p>

In a recent cinema screening, Swift described her new song as "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the intense focus from a critic to be flattering.

          <p>The Urenco uranium enrichment facility in Eunice, New Mexico, the only commercial plant of its kind in the U.S., is rapidly expanding to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This new demand is driven by the massive electricity needs of AI data centers and a broader push for domestic energy, alongside a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports set for 2028. After a decade of decline following the Fukushima disaster, the plant is now central to ambitious U.S. goals of tripling or quadrupling nuclear capacity by 2050. The expansion highlights the challenges facing the entire nuclear supply chain, from uranium conversion to grid capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

With tuition prices soaring and a challenging job market, many parents are questioning the return on investment from top-ranked, high-cost institutions. This shift is reflected in data showing fewer high-income families are willing to pay full sticker price and are more open to less prestigious schools that offer significant merit aid.

          <p>A Russian drone attack targeted a passenger train at a station in Shostka, in Ukraine's northern Sumy region, injuring at least 30 people including passengers and railway staff. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strike as an act of terrorism, emphasizing that the target was clearly civilian. This attack is part of a broader Russian strategy of targeting Ukraine's energy and transportation infrastructure, with recent overnight strikes also causing power outages for 50,000 households. In response, Ukraine has reportedly targeted one of Russia's largest oil refineries near St. Petersburg.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack on a Manchester synagogue, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian groups to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews" and reconsider planned protests. He argued that the demonstrations would cause distress and stoke tensions at a sensitive time. Police leaders in both London and Manchester have expressed concern that policing the protests will strain resources needed to provide enhanced security for Jewish communities. While protest organizers have stated their intent to proceed, asserting that cancelling peaceful protest "lets terror win," the timing has created significant public and political debate.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter as an opportune time for a comprehensive financial review. With most of the year's income and spending data available, individuals can make more accurate and impactful decisions regarding tax strategies before the December 31 deadline. This is particularly relevant this year due to recent tax law changes. Experts also advise creating a budget for the upcoming holiday season now to avoid starting the new year with financial stress and debt. Proactive planning can help align spending with long-term financial goals and mitigate the impact of inflation on holiday expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

This pause is not an official ceasefire, and Israeli forces may make tactical adjustments while remaining vigilant against any attempts by Hamas to exploit the situation. Indirect talks are scheduled to begin in Egypt, which will test the seriousness of Hamas's recent positive response to a U.S.-backed peace proposal. Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has welcomed the developments, and Gaza's health ministry reported updated casualty figures from the conflict.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that the UK will withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if the Tories win the next election. The major policy shift follows a party legal review which concluded that remaining in the ECHR obstructs key government objectives, particularly on migration reform. The move is seen as an attempt to appeal to right-wing voters and counter the growing influence of the Reform UK party, which also advocates for leaving the convention. The announcement has been criticized by Labour as a sign of weakness and by the Liberal Democrats as aligning the UK with authoritarian states.</p>

          <p>Academics in China are highlighting the growing role of science fiction and speculative fiction as a tool of national soft power. At a recent conference, Professor Du Lanlan of Nanjing University argued that the genre has historically been dominated by Western, often dystopian, perspectives rooted in capitalist anxieties. In contrast, China is fostering its own sci-fi narratives that can project a different vision of the future. By supporting this literary genre, China aims to stake a claim on future-oriented discourse, offering alternative worldviews and critiquing the present from a non-Western ideological standpoint, thereby influencing global cultural conversations.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, many students of color and LGBTQ+ students are expressing unease with his posthumous deification and the resulting campus climate. Interviews reveal a feeling that his often hateful rhetoric is being overlooked and that marginalized communities are being unfairly blamed for his death. The aftermath has seen racist threats targeted at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and disciplinary action against students for mocking his death. This has sparked a broader debate among students about the limits of free speech, censorship, and the potential for increased political polarization on college campuses.</p>

She claims her attempts to provide scientific guidance were consistently rejected.

          <p>A new progressive political party in the UK, intended to challenge the ruling Labour Party from the left, has been plagued by public divisions just as it launched. The party, co-led by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP Zarah Sultana, experienced a meltdown when a membership drive email was disavowed by Corbyn's faction as "unauthorized." This led to mutual recriminations, with Sultana complaining of a "sexist boys' club," exposing deep rifts over the party's vision and control. The infighting threatens to derail the project, which already faces the significant challenge of Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system that hinders third parties.</p>
