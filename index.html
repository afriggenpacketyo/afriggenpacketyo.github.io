          <p>Amazon has announced plans to shut down its 19 till-free grocery stores in the United Kingdom, less than five years after their launch. The company intends to convert five of these locations into Whole Foods stores, a brand it owns, while shifting its primary focus to online grocery delivery services through partnerships. This decision, impacting 250 employees, comes after an evaluation of business operations and growth opportunities in online delivery, with analysts noting the highly competitive UK grocery market. The move suggests a strategic pivot towards leveraging its core strength in online retail and logistics.</p>

          <p>In a combative speech to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Donald Trump criticized the international body for its perceived ineffectiveness, calling it a source of "empty words." He covered a wide range of topics, from migration, which he claimed was ruining countries, to climate change, which he labeled a "con job." Trump also addressed the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, touted his administration's achievements, and asserted that his predictions about global affairs have been consistently correct. The address underscored his deep skepticism of globalist institutions and international cooperation.</p>

          <p>In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, Chicago artist Liz Flores has designed a special jersey for the Chicago Cubs that merges Latino cultural motifs with the team's iconic branding. The jersey, which features the word "Cachorros" (Spanish for Cubs), incorporates folk art designs while maintaining the team's traditional red and blue colors. Flores aimed to create a design that allows fans to express both their support for the Cubs and their pride in their Hispanic and Latino identity. While the special ticket package for the jersey sold out quickly, a t-shirt with similar designs will be available for fans.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants are reportedly set to start rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart for their upcoming Week 4 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, replacing veteran Russell Wilson. The decision follows a poor performance against the Kansas City Chiefs, where Wilson threw two interceptions and the offense struggled, leading to boos from the home crowd. Head coach Brian Daboll had indicated that an evaluation of the quarterback position was underway. This move signals a significant shift for the team as they look to ignite their passing game with the first-round draft pick from Ole Miss.</p>

          <p>Numerous Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations across the United States have been canceled or postponed due to widespread fear within communities over potential immigration raids by the Trump administration. Organizers in cities from Chicago to Sacramento cited safety concerns and the current political climate as primary reasons for scrapping major public events like festivals and parades. The article notes that this change reflects a shift from a celebratory atmosphere to one of caution, as large gatherings are perceived as potential targets for ICE enforcement. Community leaders are now urging residents to be cautious and aware of their rights during this period.</p>

          <p>Errol Musk, the 79-year-old father of entrepreneur Elon Musk, has been accused of sexually abusing five of his children and stepchildren, according to a report from the New York Times. The allegations, which Errol Musk denies as "false" and "nonsense," date back to 1993 and have reportedly prompted multiple law enforcement investigations over the years. The article notes that Elon Musk has publicly described his relationship with his father as difficult, once stating his father has done "almost every evil thing you could possibly think of."

          <p>American households are projected to face higher heating bills this winter, with average costs expected to increase by 7.6% to around $976, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The rise is driven by soaring electricity and natural gas prices, which have outpaced general inflation. This follows a summer of record-high air-conditioning expenses, compounding financial strain on families already dealing with increased debt. Factors contributing to the price hikes include grid maintenance costs, higher natural gas prices, and increased demand from data centers, leading to a surge in unpaid energy bills nationwide.

          <p>The New York Liberty have announced they will not renew the contract of head coach Sandy Brondello, less than a year after she led the team to its first-ever WNBA championship. The decision comes after a season plagued by injuries to key players, which resulted in a first-round playoff loss to the Phoenix Mercury. Despite the disappointing end to the season, Brondello leaves as the winningest coach in franchise history with a 107-53 record. Star player Breanna Stewart had publicly supported Brondello after the playoff loss, praising her resilience and leadership through a difficult year.</p>

          <p>A story from NPR's "My Unsung Hero" series recounts an act of kindness experienced by Lara Friedman and her Rottweiler, The Dude. During an evening walk, nearby fireworks sent the 120-pound dog into a total panic, making it impossible for Friedman to get him home safely on the slippery sidewalks. As she stood frozen, two strangers, who introduced themselves as Blake and Bubba, noticed her distress and offered to help. After failing to walk the dog, Blake drove them all home in his car, a gesture of compassion that left a lasting impression on Friedman.</p>

          <p>Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker from Ethiopia, has been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping. The incidents, which occurred shortly after his arrival in the UK, involved unwanted touching and attempts to kiss the schoolgirl. His arrest sparked protests outside the hotel where he was being housed. The Home Office has stated it will seek to deport Kebatu following his sentence, a wish his barrister said he shares. The judge described the experience as "disgusting and sickening" for the young victim.</p>

          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money delves into the highly profitable business of creating and maintaining the S&P 500 stock market index. While the list itself seems simple, S&P Global earns hundreds of millions annually by licensing its name and data to financial products like index funds and ETFs, which track the index. The S&P 500's dominance is protected by a strong brand, economies of scale, and its status as a common language in finance. The article also notes the growing concern that the index is now heavily weighted towards a few tech giants, concentrating risk for millions of investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128. This is about $210 less per month compared to the payments at the beginning of the year when rates were above 7%. The lower rates provide significant savings for new homebuyers and also create attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments or shorten their loan term.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump delivered a speech to the United Nations that was a full-throttle assault on the institution and its core principles, according to a Sky News analysis. The address lacked a singular thread, instead weaving through familiar grievances against immigration, climate change policies, and the UN's perceived failures. He blamed European nations for funding the war in Ukraine by purchasing Russian energy and criticized Western allies for recognizing a Palestinian state. The article characterizes the speech as a collection of greatest hits from his presidency, delivered with a confrontational and self-congratulatory tone, asserting he has "been right about everything."</p>

A commentary in the official PLA Daily noted Japan's progress with truck-mounted lasers and a new program to develop ship-mounted systems capable of intercepting drone swarms. While many countries are investing in directed-energy weapons as a defense against drones, Beijing views Japan's efforts with "high caution." Japan's defense ministry has allocated significant funding to accelerate the development of these high-power laser systems for its Self-Defense Forces.</p>

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and former Republican Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, now a Democrat, have both announced their candidacies. Their entry highlights the persistent political fallout from the 2020 election crisis in the state. Both face challenges within their respective parties, as the Georgia GOP remains loyal to Trump, while the Democratic primary field is becoming increasingly crowded with established candidates.</p>

Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, won the primary on a progressive platform that has caused division within the party. His critical stance on Israel's war in Gaza and calls for higher taxes have led figures like Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and House Leader Hakeem Jeffries to withhold their support.
