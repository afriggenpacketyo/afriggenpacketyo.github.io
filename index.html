          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast by employing mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized the understanding of yeast metabolism into four distinct, interconnected phases, moving beyond the traditional three-stage process. These phases, named 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, reflect unique metabolic states that mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint found in traditional Chinese medicine. This approach highlights the balance between passive and active forces, similar to the "four symbols" theory, to maintain harmony within the cell. The study, published in NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics, provides a new perspective on understanding molecular life mechanisms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military launched airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, which he declared a "spectacular military success." Trump stated the objective was to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and eliminate the threat posed by the country. He warned Iran to strive for a peace deal with Israel, cautioning that failure to do so would result in far greater consequences. The strikes involved B-2 stealth bombers and bunker-buster munitions, specifically targeting the underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo. The U.S. communicated to Iran that these strikes were the extent of their planned action and that regime change was not the goal.</p>

Domestically, the Sunday Express focused on asylum hotels and the Home Office's failure to collect Â£50m from firms profiting from housing asylum seekers. The Sunday Times continued its focus on the assisted dying bill, reporting on the health secretary's concerns about its impact on the NHS.

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, seen as a precursor to the upcoming House of Councillors race, as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba navigates a minority government. The Liberal Democratic Party aims to retain its seats despite low approval ratings, with no party holding a majority in the assembly. Major parties are actively using social media and street speeches to appeal to voters, especially unaffiliated ones. Key issues include support for households facing inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke. A new party launched by Shinji Ishimaru, who gained prominence in the 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial race, is also drawing attention.</p>

          <p>A Vox senior correspondent argues that the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites marks a significant departure from President Trump's previous foreign policy, characterizing it as "Trump's war." Unlike past military actions that Trump inherited, this intervention is presented as a choice, contradicting his earlier promises of military restraint and a shift away from the Middle East. The decision to strike Iran was made despite ongoing negotiations and dissenting assessments from intelligence agencies, aligning the U.S. with Israel's war against the Islamic Republic. This action is described as a major blow to those who hoped for a new era of military restraint under the Trump administration, as the U.S. has now relocated military assets from Asia for this conflict.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores the potential consequences of President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in military action against Iran, highlighting the inherent uncertainties and risks. The best-case scenario involves a crippling blow to Iran's nuclear ambitions, leading to political instability and the fall of the current regime. However, the worst-case scenario could see Iran accelerating its nuclear program, retaliating against U.S. targets, and destabilizing the region further. A more likely outcome involves a delayed Iranian nuclear program, increased regional instability, and a wounded but surviving Iranian regime. The analysis emphasizes the potential for miscalculation and accidents, particularly given the inexperience of the White House national-security team.</p>

His killer, Samuel Woodward, a former classmate and member of the violent hate group Atomwaffen, was convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The couple has promoted positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name, creating a legacy of tolerance and inspiration.

          <p>President Donald Trump's approach to Iran has shifted rapidly, moving from a two-week window for diplomacy to military strikes within just two days. Despite stating he would decide "within the next two weeks" whether to order a U.S. military strike, Trump authorized strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. He dismissed talks between European diplomats and Iran's foreign minister, stating that Iran only wanted to speak to the U.S. Trump also contradicted his own intelligence community, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. This swift change in policy underscores the volatile nature of the situation and Trump's willingness to act decisively.</p>

          <p>The United States has entered the conflict between Israel and Iran, with President Trump announcing attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. Navy submarines launched over 30 Tomahawk missiles into Iran, escalating U.S. involvement in the region. Trump stated that the U.S. and Israel worked closely together and that the strikes aimed to eliminate the threat to the American ally. He warned of further action if Iran does not pursue peace, marking a shift from his earlier stance of avoiding active warfare in the Middle East. The move comes just 48 hours after Trump indicated a two-week window for diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>The United States has launched strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran. President Trump announced the strikes, describing them as "very successful," but Democrats and some Republicans have already criticized the action. B-2 stealth bombers were reportedly used, dropping Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on the Iranian targets, and dozens of other U.S. aircraft were involved. Trump warned Iran to "make peace," stating that future attacks would be "far greater" if they did not comply, and Democrats criticized the move as unconstitutional. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the strikes, stating they would not halt Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are introducing "property supermarkets," both online and offline, to support the country's struggling housing market. Chengdu is the latest city to launch a homebuying platform, partnering with state-owned and private developers to feature over 50 projects on a mobile app. These platforms aim to make homebuying more transparent and efficient, consolidating information and services such as mortgage applications and property registration. Similar initiatives have been rolled out in other cities, with some focusing on residents holding housing vouchers. The goal is to improve transaction efficiency and minimize false promotions by vetting listings through local governments.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed has criticized President Donald Trump's public rebuke of his own Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, calling it "shocking." Reed suggests that Trump's dismissal of Gabbard's assessment, which stated that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon, may be politically motivated. He posits that Trump's desire to justify potential military action against Iran is driving him to contradict his intelligence community. Reed also questions the timing of the shift in assessment, noting that it coincides with increased Israeli pressure and activity. The comments underscore the growing tension between the administration and the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original findings. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Dorotik's legal team presented evidence that some spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. The prosecution admitted that the new DNA evidence cast doubt on the verdict, leading to the overturning of the conviction. Despite the overturned conviction, the DA's office initially decided to retry her, but eventually dismissed the charges, marking the end of Dorotik's legal ordeal.</p>

          <p>The BBC provides an overview of what is known about the U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the targets and potential repercussions. President Trump stated that American warplanes bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation in the conflict between Iran and Israel, and that one of the targets was Fordo. The U.S. contacted Iran through diplomatic channels to say the air strikes were all it intended to do and that "regime change efforts" were "not planned". The analysis highlights the use of GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators to target the underground Fordo facility and the potential for Iranian retaliation. The report also notes Israel's increased security measures following the strikes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's pledge to be a "peacemaker" in the Middle East is now under scrutiny as the U.S. has launched military strikes on Iran, hitting three nuclear sites. Trump's earlier promises to prevent "World War Three" and end "chaos in the Middle East" contrast sharply with this direct military intervention. The U.S. strike marks a break from Trump's prior vows to keep the United States out of war and comes just days after suggesting a two-week window for diplomatic resolution. While Trump has consistently opposed Iran's nuclear ambitions, this action puts Washington in direct conflict with Tehran, raising questions about the future of diplomacy in the region.</p>
