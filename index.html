          <h2>Federal Judge Upholds Colorado Law Restricting Gun Sales to Those 21 and Older</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has upheld a Colorado law that bans individuals under 21 from purchasing firearms, siding with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit's view that age-based restrictions on gun purchases do not violate the Second Amendment. The lawsuit against Gov. Jared Polis was filed by Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and two individuals seeking to buy firearms, but the judge agreed that the issue falls under a "safe harbor" exclusion, exempting it from constitutional scrutiny. Exceptions to the law are made for members of the U.S. Military and peace officers making purchases while on duty and in accordance with their agency's policies. This decision contrasts with a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which struck down a similar federal restriction. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>A public feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump escalated after Musk criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," leading to personal attacks and accusations. Musk claimed Trump was in the Epstein files, a claim Trump has denied in the past, and also asserted that Trump would have lost the 2024 election without his support. Trump responded by saying Musk had gone "CRAZY" and suggested terminating his government contracts and subsidies, with the White House calling the feud "an unfortunate episode." The disagreement stems from Musk's opposition to the bill's cost and its impact on the national debt, while Trump alleges Musk is upset about the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles. The optimism score is 25.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales, predicting potential rainfall of 10-15mm in less than an hour in some areas. The warning is in effect from 09:00 BST to 18:00 BST on Saturday, with additional hazards including frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds expected. The weather agency cautioned that the heavy showers could disrupt transport, potentially causing delays to driving and train services, and may lead to short-term power outages and damage to buildings from lightning strikes. While thunderstorms are difficult to predict precisely, the Met Office advises that some areas may experience torrential downpours while others remain dry. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>A Texas woman has died from a rare brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba after using tap water in a nasal irrigation device, according to the CDC. The 71-year-old woman developed severe symptoms, including fever, headache, and altered mental status, within four days of using the contaminated water from an RV's water system at a campground. The CDC recommends using distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled tap water for nasal irrigation to prevent such infections, which typically occur from recreational water activities in warm freshwater. Infections occur when water containing the amoeba goes up the nose and to the brain, but cannot be contracted by swallowing contaminated water or from another infected person.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington was largely overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, the visit was considered a success for Merz, who managed to address key issues such as strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs impacting German industries, and U.S. support for Ukraine. Merz also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate to highlight the president's family connection to Germany, and emphasized Germany's commitment to increased defense spending. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party, the Alternative fuer Deutschland, was seemingly avoided during the meeting. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>The US economy added 139,000 jobs in May, a slowdown compared to previous months, as businesses grapple with uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised down the number of jobs created in March and April by a total of 95,000.

          <p>A group of eight men removed from the US to Djibouti are stranded in a converted shipping container, along with 13 ICE officers, after a deportation flight to South Sudan was stopped by a US court. The DHS reported that both the detainees and ICE officers are experiencing suspected bacterial upper respiratory infections, with the ICE officers also facing potential risks from burn pits and the threat of rocket attacks. The Trump administration had attempted to deport the men, who it claimed had criminal convictions, to their home countries, but several countries declined to accept them.

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a roughly 4% increase on Friday after a significant drop the previous day, which analysts attributed to a feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

          <p>An analysis discusses the increasingly existential nature of elections in many democracies, where deeper cultural divides overshadow economic and policy arguments. The author uses the recent Polish presidential election as an example, where blood-and-soil nationalism proved a powerful force, even after the election of a centrist coalition in 2023. The language of blood and soil, which has once again become central to public debate in many democracies, is very powerful, helping people explain a complex world. The author argues that all elections will continue to be existential for a long time to come, with small numbers of voters deciding the nature of the state, the future of democracy, and the independence of courts.
