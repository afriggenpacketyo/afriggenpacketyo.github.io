          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:11:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move described as unusual by legal experts. This decision follows public pressure and criticism over the administration's handling of Epstein-related files, particularly after a Justice Department memo stated no "client list" existed. The release of these materials is not immediate and requires court approval, with potential objections from Epstein's associates and victims. The scope of the requested materials is currently unclear but could be extensive.</p>

          <p>Air travel this summer has seen a significant increase in disruptions, with the national flight cancellation rate jumping by 29% compared to the same period last year. East Coast airports have been particularly affected, with Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport experiencing a 274% rise in its cancellation rate. Despite fewer scheduled flights overall, the number of cancellations has increased, and delays have become longer on average. Conversely, some airports, like Miami International and San Francisco International, have seen improved performance with fewer cancellations.</p>

          <p>Chevron is set to finalize its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation following a favorable ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce. The decision resolves a dispute with Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's significant oil assets in Guyana's Stabroek Block. Exxon, while disagreeing with the panel's interpretation, has stated it will respect the outcome and welcomed Chevron to the joint venture. The resolution removes major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported a 60% year-over-year increase in serious water pollution incidents in England for 2024, reaching the highest number on record. A total of 75 incidents were classified as causing "serious or persistent" harm, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. A cross-party parliamentary committee criticized regulators for being "missing in action" and failing to hold companies accountable for underinvestment in infrastructure. The findings precede a major review of the water industry expected to recommend significant reforms.</p>

The measure, which passed narrowly along party lines, includes significant cuts to foreign aid programs and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The vote was delayed by political maneuvering from Democrats, who attempted to attach amendments related to the Jeffrey Epstein case to capitalize on internal GOP divisions over the matter.

While all income groups will see some benefit, the analysis indicates that higher-income households will receive a proportionally larger share of the cuts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced plans to stimulate domestic service consumption and attract more foreign investment over the next five years. The government aims to address a "shortage of high-quality service" by reducing restrictive measures and enriching supply, particularly in healthcare and elderly care. This strategy is part of a broader effort to rely more on domestic demand for economic growth, especially as the country faces an uncertain international trade environment. The initiative seeks to bolster the service sector as a reliable engine for the world's second-largest economy.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Martin Hemmings has publicly alleged that Raynor Winn, author of the bestselling memoir "The Salt Path," stole approximately £64,000 from their property business in the early 2000s. They claim that Winn, who worked as their bookkeeper, was the cause of the financial ruin that preceded the events described in her book. This accusation follows an Observer investigation into claims that Winn's book gave a misleading account of why she and her husband lost their home. Winn has acknowledged making "mistakes" but maintains the dispute did not cause their homelessness.</p>

          <p>As part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," visitors to the United States requiring a non-immigrant visa will soon have to pay a new, non-waivable "$250 visa integrity fee." This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if the visa holder complies with all conditions, such as not overstaying their visit. However, significant questions remain about the implementation process, and the Congressional Budget Office expects few travelers will actually seek reimbursement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has voiced regret for previously urging Democrats to "bully the shit out of" Donald Trump, stating the former president "brings out the worst in me." His reflective comments came in an interview following the assassination of former Minnesota state house speaker Melissa Hortman. Walz suggested a need for more careful language in politics, while also criticizing Trump for using the tragedy as an opportunity to attack him personally. The governor attributed his anger to Trump's pugnacious political style and his dismissive response to the killings in their state.</p>
