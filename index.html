          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges related to online posts made after a 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Hotz had made jokes on social media that prosecutors argued constituted condoning a criminal offense and hate speech. The judge ruled the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and did not intend to disturb public order. This verdict highlights the ongoing legal and social debates in liberal democracies surrounding the boundaries of free speech, satire, and hate speech, especially in the context of political figures.</p>

          <p>The sentencing hearing for Bryan Kohberger provides the first opportunity for the families of his victims to address him directly in court through impact statements. While some families plan to speak, others have chosen not to attend, highlighting the different ways individuals cope with grief. The case has drawn national attention, with former President Trump commenting that Kohberger should be compelled to explain his motive for the murders. The surviving roommates of the victims may also speak at the hearing, as the community seeks closure following the violent crime that deeply affected Moscow, Idaho.</p>

          <p>George Finch, a 19-year-old from Reform UK, has become the youngest council leader in the United Kingdom, now heading the Warwickshire County Council. Finch, who still lives with his family and cannot drive, has faced criticism regarding his lack of experience, which he dismisses as "ageist." He became interim leader after his predecessor resigned and has already engaged in local issues, such as a controversy over a Union Jack dress at a local school. Despite his youth, Finch asserts that Reform UK offers hope to young people who feel disillusioned about their future prospects for homeownership and employment.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered by a schoolboy on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century vessel with a rich history. Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate, it participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology and archival research, driven by a strong community effort from the island's 500 residents. The well-preserved oak timbers are now being conserved, representing a significant link to the island's extensive maritime past and a model for community-led archaeology.</p>

          <p>China has established a near-monopoly on the global supply of refined rare earth elements, critical components in everything from smartphones to defense systems. This dominance was achieved over decades through a strategic, state-driven effort that involved learning from U.S. operations, enduring periods of environmental damage from unregulated mining, and consolidating hundreds of small producers into six state-controlled giants. By controlling production and pricing, Beijing has gained a powerful tool in global trade disputes, as demonstrated by recent export controls that disrupted Western supply chains. This has spurred renewed efforts in the U.S. to rebuild its domestic refining capacity.</p>

          <p>Heathrow Airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, has expressed frustration for having slept through emergency notifications during a fire in March that caused a massive power outage and canceled 1,300 flights. A review found that Woldbye's phone was on silent mode, causing him to miss the calls. He stated that while it was not his normal way of operating, the airport's crisis management procedures functioned correctly in his absence. An investigation revealed the fire was caused by a known fault at a National Grid substation, and Heathrow is now considering legal action against the power company for its failure to address the issue.</p>

          <p>The FireAid benefit concert, which raised $100 million for wildfire recovery, has been a critical lifeline for Southern California communities devastated by the January fires. Six months later, recipient organizations report that the funds have provided direct cash, food, and shelter, and supported debris removal and mental health services. However, they emphasize that the need remains significant as residents grapple with long-term challenges like housing, high food costs, and navigating bureaucracy. While the initial grants focused on immediate relief, later funding rounds are addressing longer-term rebuilding, case management, and environmental resilience efforts in the scarred region.</p>

          <p>An FDA expert panel convened to discuss the use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy is causing alarm among healthcare professionals due to its composition and content. Nine of the ten panelists have publicly questioned the safety of SSRIs, and during the discussion, several cited studies with poor controls or misrepresented findings. Outside experts expressed concern that the panel presented misinformation and failed to consider the significant risks of untreated depression in pregnant women, which is a leading cause of maternal death. Critics fear the panel's direction could prevent women from receiving necessary and safe medical care for serious mental health disorders.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California Governor Gavin Newsom's threat to overturn the state's independent redistricting commission is part of a troubling pattern of politicians ignoring voters. Newsom suggested he might let partisans redraw congressional maps to counter a similar move by Texas Republicans, despite California voters decisively creating the independent commission in 2010 to end gerrymandering. The author likens this to actions in other states where lawmakers have nullified voter-approved initiatives on issues like minimum wage and sick leave.

          <p>Children’s Hospital Los Angeles has closed its Center for Transyouth Health and Development, one of the nation's largest pediatric gender clinics, citing pressure from the Trump administration. The closure follows a Department of Justice announcement of subpoenas for patient records from clinics providing such care, creating fear among families of potential prosecution. This move is part of a broader national trend, with other major hospitals ending or reducing services for transgender youth amid legal threats and potential loss of federal funding.

          <p>California's $21-billion wildfire fund, created to shield utilities from catastrophic financial losses, could be entirely wiped out by damage claims from the recent Eaton fire. State documents reveal that if Southern California Edison's equipment is found to have caused the inferno, which killed 19 people and destroyed 9,000 homes, the resulting claims could exhaust the fund. Concerns are growing that utilities have little incentive to control settlement costs since they are passed on to the fund. State leaders are now discussing options to shore up the fund, potentially including extending a surcharge on customer electricity bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece condemns the U.S. Supreme Court for issuing significant rulings through its emergency appeals process, or "shadow docket," without providing written explanations. The author highlights recent cases where the court lifted lower court injunctions, allowing deportations and federal employee firings to proceed without any stated legal reasoning. This practice breaks from the historical tradition of justifying decisions, which provides guidance and conveys reasoned judgment over raw power. The article argues that this lack of transparency is inexcusable, undermines deference to lower courts, and erodes public trust in the institution, especially when matters of life and death are at stake.</p>
