        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels at a new high, homeowners are considering borrowing through home equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently have nearly identical interest rates. This article analyzes which option might be cheaper over the summer, suggesting that HELOCs could become the less expensive choice due to their variable rates. If the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated interest rate cuts, HELOC borrowers would benefit quickly. However, the article cautions that this is not guaranteed, as fixed-rate home equity loans offer stability against potential rate increases in an unpredictable economic climate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has temporarily halted the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man facing human smuggling charges, after his own lawyers raised concerns he could be deported. This unusual request came after the Department of Justice gave conflicting statements about whether he would be deported immediately upon release or allowed to stay for his trial. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador by mistake despite a court order barring his removal due to fears of persecution. He was returned to the U.S. only to be indicted on charges of conspiring to transport migrants.</p>

Documents suggest he looted victims and was involved in atrocities.

          <p>President Trump announced an immediate termination of all trade discussions with Canada, citing Ottawa's plan to implement a digital services tax on American technology firms. In a social media post, Trump called the tax an "egregious" and "blatant attack" on the U.S., threatening to impose new tariffs on Canada within a week. The move jeopardizes a trade relationship valued at over $762 billion last year and caused a brief downturn in stock markets. Canadian officials have stated they will proceed with the tax, which is set to begin collection soon.</p>

          <p>This opinion article frames a hypothetical military operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," as a successful strike that destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities under President Trump's command. The author argues that this fictional decisive action contrasts with the approaches of previous presidents who were drawn into prolonged conflicts. The piece posits that Trump's dealmaking abilities are now essential to maintain a fragile ceasefire and prevent a larger war in the Middle East. It concludes by expressing confidence that Trump can secure peace without entangling the U.S. in another quagmire.</p>

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus is reportedly considering ending production at its UK headquarters in Hethel, Norfolk, and establishing a new plant in the U.S. This potential move, which would put 1,300 jobs at risk, is influenced by newly imposed U.S. tariffs that have disrupted its business. America is a major market for Lotus, and the 25% tariffs on imported cars and parts have already led to a temporary production halt. The company, majority-owned by Chinese group Geely, has faced financial pressures, previously announcing job cuts amid volatile market conditions.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, rising 44% and hitting its highest level since its 2021 IPO. The surge is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further room to grow, citing its lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is that legislative clarity could fuel further growth. (not investment advice)</p>

In response, President Trump is reported as saying Iran's program was "obliterated" and that it would take years to restart.

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court ruling that limits the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive orders, specifically his order to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the 6-3 decision restricts a federal judge's ability to block a president's policy across the entire country. Trump praised the decision as a "monumental win," while Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer called it a "terrifying step toward authoritarianism" that weakens the judiciary's ability to check executive power.</p>

The suit alleges that the network, and specifically anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly lied by claiming Newsom was untruthful about a phone call with President Trump. The dispute centers on whether Trump called Newsom on a specific day to discuss protests in Los Angeles. Newsom's lawsuit claims Fox News distorted the facts to curry favor with the president and has offered to drop the suit in exchange for a retraction and on-air apology. Fox News called the lawsuit a "frivolous publicity stunt."</p>

          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, is leading an aggressive turnaround plan for the Stellantis truck brand, which has seen sales decline 38% since 2019. The strategy includes reintroducing Hemi V-8 engines, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new industry-leading powertrain warranty. Kuniskis acknowledged that production issues with the redesigned Ram 1500 and other problems contributed to the brand's struggles. The plan aims to reclaim significant market share in the highly profitable full-size pickup segment, with Kuniskis targeting a market share of at least 20%.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants, effective in early September. The administration argues that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently for their return, a claim that contrasts with the State Department's Level 4 travel advisory warning of danger in the country. This decision will revoke legal status and work permits for over 260,000 Haitians who have been protected since the 2010 earthquake. Those who do not qualify for another legal status will face arrest and deportation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears that new tariffs would trigger a surge in inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, a practice known as front-loading. Businesses are also absorbing some costs and utilizing loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments while waiting for more clarity on trade policy. While these short-term strategies have buffered consumers from immediate price shocks, experts warn that inflation could still rise in the latter half of the year if tariffs remain elevated.</p>

          <p>In his closing argument, Sean "Diddy" Combs's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, characterized the federal prosecution of the music mogul as a "fake trial" and an overzealous attempt to criminalize a swinger lifestyle. Agnifilo argued that the government exaggerated evidence of recreational drug use and consensual sexual activity to build a baseless racketeering conspiracy case. He mocked the prosecution's evidence, including the seizure of personal lubricants, and insisted that no witness had testified to being part of a racketeering enterprise. Combs, who faces life in prison if convicted on sex trafficking and other charges, chose not to testify.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of Maryland parents who sought to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving books with LGBTQ+ themes. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that the school district's policy burdened the parents' right to the free exercise of religion by not allowing opt-outs. The court ordered the school to provide advance notice and allow children to be excused. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned the ruling would create "chaos for this nation's public schools" and impose impossible administrative burdens.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of depositing $10,000 into either a high-yield savings account or a money market account. With top rates currently around 4.30% for high-yield savings and 4.32% for money markets, the difference in earnings is minimal. Over one year, a money market account would earn approximately $2 more than a high-yield savings account, assuming rates remain stable. Since both account types have variable rates that could change, the article concludes that savers cannot make a wrong choice between the two for maximizing returns on their cash.

The author contends that the ruling creates a significant administrative burden on schools, which may now need to pre-emptively notify parents about a wide range of potentially objectionable content to avoid lawsuits. This legal pressure, combined with the financial incentive for lawyers to sue non-compliant districts, will likely lead many schools to simply exclude queer-themed books from their curriculum entirely.</p>

          <p>With many Americans facing significant debt, this article outlines five types of debt that are often eligible for forgiveness or settlement negotiations. Unsecured debts like credit card balances and personal loans are the most common candidates, as creditors are often willing to accept a lower lump-sum payment rather than risk a total default. Medical bills are also frequently negotiable, with hospitals and providers often offering assistance programs or reduced payment options. While more complex, buy now, pay later plans and high-interest payday loans can also sometimes be settled, though they present greater challenges.</p>

Tarvet expressed his belief that he deserves the money he worked hard to win and called for a change in the collegiate sports regulations.

          <p>This review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a purposeful return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her youth, set against the backdrop of downtown Manhattan. The album explores themes of desire, heartbreak, and self-discovery in her late 20s, but the reviewer finds the result is diluted by a self-consciousness that verges on self-obsession. While praising moments of sonic magic and her skillful vocal delivery, the article critiques the production as feeling like a compromise and the lyrical focus as overly insular.

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were honored by lying in state at the state Capitol, accompanied by the ashes of their beloved golden retriever, Gilbert. The dog was also fatally shot during the attack that killed the couple and is believed to be the first nonhuman to receive such an honor. Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects to Hortman, a former House speaker, her husband, and their dog. The family was known for fostering service animals, and Gilbert's story has drawn widespread tributes and support online.</p>

          <p>Three years after USC and UCLA's departure triggered a mass exodus, the Pac-12 conference has invited Texas State University to become its eighth football-playing member, a move expected to be accepted soon. The addition of Texas State, currently in the Sun Belt Conference, is crucial for the Pac-12 to maintain its status as an NCAA conference. This follows the additions of five Mountain West schools and Gonzaga. The move was encouraged by the Pac-12's new media rights deal with CBS, which will provide a much-needed television and streaming presence for the rebuilt conference starting in 2026.</p>

          <h2>Honduran Mother Sues US Government After She and Her Two Children, Including a 6-Year-Old with Cancer, Were Detained by ICE</h2>

          <p>A Honduran asylum seeker is suing the U.S. government after she and her two young children were detained by ICE agents outside a Los Angeles immigration court. The family, which includes a 6-year-old son being treated for leukemia, had been paroled into the country and was attending a required hearing when their case was dismissed and they were arrested. The lawsuit challenges the legality of their detention in a Texas facility, arguing it violates their due process rights, especially given the child's medical needs. The family had entered the U.S. legally through a CBP One appointment after fleeing death threats in Honduras.</p>
