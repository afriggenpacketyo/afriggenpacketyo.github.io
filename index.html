          <p>Poland's government is experiencing decreased approval ratings as it faces obstruction from the president regarding its reform initiatives. The upcoming presidential election on May 18 will be crucial in determining whether the current stalemate will persist or conclude. Donald Tusk, the current leader, has chosen to support Rafal Trzaskowski, a left-wing liberal and the mayor of Warsaw, as the presidential candidate. The outcome of the election will significantly impact the government's ability to advance its agenda and implement promised reforms. The other major candidate is Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by the conservative Law and Justice party.</p>

Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post.

The tariffs announced by President Trump have disrupted expansion plans and raised concerns about scaring off American customers.

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts under President Trump's agenda have raised concerns among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. Key components of the bill look to provide major tax breaks by cutting spending elsewhere, including massive cuts to Medicaid.
