        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing protests following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, prompting activists to organize "mass mobilizations." In response, approximately 300 National Guard troops have been deployed to protect federal property and personnel after President Trump authorized the deployment of at least 2,000 troops to Los Angeles County due to clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. ICE operations resulted in the arrests of 118 immigrants, including individuals linked to criminal organizations, while protesters gathered outside federal buildings, leading to arrests and clashes with law enforcement, with local officials expressing concerns about escalating tensions and eroding public trust. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Mayor Bass stated city officials are working with law enforcement to find a resolution, highlighting the complexities of immigration enforcement and community response in Los Angeles. </p>

The comparison highlights concerns about academic freedom and the potential for political interference in education.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests is being criticized as an overreach of presidential power based on a fabricated crisis. Despite some isolated incidents of violence during the protests, the city remains largely peaceful, and local law enforcement is capable of managing the situation. Critics argue that Trump's actions are aimed at expanding his control over the military and targeting a Democratic city with a large immigrant population. The deployment is viewed as a political maneuver to create a national emergency and undermine civil liberties.</p>

          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, common sources of conflict include tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contemptuous tone is a strong predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication can also lead to significant conflict. The article suggests strategies for couples to address these issues, such as naming the effect of condescending tones, reassuring each other in family disputes, acknowledging the invisible load of domestic work, and using a designated word to signal the need for a time-out during heated conversations.</p>

Protests erupted, and authorities responded with tear gas and flash-bang grenades as demonstrators voiced their anger over increased immigration enforcement.

The current CBA allows players to receive half of any prize money with a hard cap of $1 million, which the Club World Cup's participation prize already maxes out.

          <p>Terry Moran, a veteran ABC News correspondent, has been suspended after posting a critical tweet about President Trump and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Moran described Miller as a "world-class hater" and Trump as motivated by self-glorification, leading ABC News to state that his comments violated the division's policy on objectivity. The White House condemned Moran's remarks, and the suspension reflects heightened sensitivity among news networks regarding antagonizing the Trump White House. The incident underscores the challenges faced by journalists in maintaining impartiality amid political tensions.</p>

While some view the book as a potential savior for the Democratic Party, others fear it could undermine the anti-corporate populist movement. The book focuses on addressing shortages in areas like housing and energy production, a perspective that clashes with the populist left's emphasis on concentrated power. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle within the Democratic Party to define its future direction and priorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's swift response to protests in California, including the deployment of the National Guard, is seen as a move that could thrill his base but also inflame tensions. Despite the LAPD reporting that the protests were largely peaceful, the Trump administration cited injuries to immigration agents and a slow response from local law enforcement. Trump federalized the California National Guard and threatened to deploy U.S. Marines, actions that Governor Newsom criticized as an infringement on states' rights. The situation highlights the potential for escalating conflict and the administration's willingness to assert federal authority.</p>

The deployment is seen as a way to whip up the fervor of his base and target California, a state often invoked as a hub of "wokeness" and immigration lawlessness.</p>
