          <p>Eighteen years after Madeleine McCann's disappearance from Praia da Luz in Portugal, a renewed search effort is underway. Portuguese and German authorities are focusing on disused buildings and wells in the Lagos municipality, near where Madeleine vanished in 2007. The search covers a 21 sq km site between Praia da Luz and the location where prime suspect Christian BrÃ¼ckner was staying at the time. BrÃ¼ckner, currently imprisoned in Germany for a sexual assault case, has repeatedly denied involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, while British police continue to treat the case as a missing persons investigation. The search aims to gather new evidence and potentially provide closure to this long-standing and high-profile case.</p>

The latest talks in Istanbul yielded prisoner exchanges, but Ukrainian officials maintain that Russia is stalling and manipulating negotiations to avoid sanctions.

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projects China's economic growth to slow to 4.3% next year, a slight decrease from its previous forecast, due to ongoing global trade strife. The OECD cites "substantial barriers to trade," "diminishing confidence," and "heightened policy uncertainty" as factors putting downward pressure on global economic growth. The report suggests that Chinese exports will be curbed by newly imposed tariffs, disproportionately affecting private companies, including foreign ones, which are major exporters. This adjustment reflects the broader challenges facing the global economy amid escalating trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a Â£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure projects across England, focusing on tram, train, and bus improvements in mayoral authorities. Greater Manchester will receive Â£2.5 billion for tram network extensions, while the West Midlands will get Â£2.4 billion for service extensions. Six other metro mayors will also receive significant investments to improve transport connections in their regions. This move marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, aiming to address regional economic disparities and boost growth in areas outside of London and the south-east.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, impacting global exporters but granting the U.K. a temporary reprieve with a 25% tariff. President Trump cited the "Economic Prosperity Deal" with the U.K. as warranting "different treatment," although he warned the rate could increase to 50% if the U.K. does not comply with the deal's terms. The move is intended to protect the U.S. steel industry amid cheaper foreign imports, but it has raised concerns among European exporters. The U.S. accounts for 7% of the U.K.'s total steel exports, valued at Â£370 million in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's electric vehicle sales in Australia rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by record sales of the Model Y. The company reported a jump to 3,897 vehicle sales, a 9.3% increase year-over-year and a 675% surge from April. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's global sales have faced challenges due to increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk.
