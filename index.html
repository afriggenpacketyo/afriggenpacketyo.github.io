          <p>A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv resulted in at least 14 deaths and 40 injuries, according to Ukrainian officials. The strike heavily damaged a residential building, destroying dozens of apartments, and emergency workers were deployed to rescue people from the rubble. The attack occurred as world leaders gathered for the G7 meeting in Canada, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was expected to attend, but President Trump returned to Washington early due to the escalating tensions in the Middle East. The Interior Minister reported that a U.S. citizen was among those killed in the attack. The destruction highlights the ongoing conflict's devastating impact on civilian areas. </p>

Amid uncertainties surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, the BOJ maintained its benchmark policy rate at its two-day meeting.

Concerns over U.S. fiscal discipline, highlighted by President Trump's tariffs and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating, have further fueled interest in alternative safe havens like gold. While the dollar and U.S. Treasurys have historically been reliable, recent policy volatility has compromised confidence in U.S. assets (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>England Needs More Hosepipe Bans and Smart Water Meters, Watchdog Says</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environment Agency warns that England faces significant water shortages in the future and requires a sustained effort to reduce demand, including increased hosepipe bans and smart water meters. Without action, England, which uses 14 billion liters of water daily, could face a shortage of over six billion liters by 2055. The agency calls for more homes to have meters reporting real-time water usage and suggests that prices may need to rise during times of tight supply. This warning comes as droughts have already been declared in parts of England following a warm and dry spring. </p>

          <p>Families are grieving as officials begin handing over the remains of victims from the recent Air India crash, India’s deadliest aviation tragedy in recent memory. The slow DNA identification process, due to the condition of the bodies, has caused distress for families awaiting confirmation. The London-bound Boeing 787 crashed minutes after takeoff, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. A high-level committee has been set up to investigate the causes of the crash and formulate procedures to prevent future aircraft emergencies. </p>

Negotiations to remove this continue, and officials say it is over a technicality of proving that steel has been made in the UK. </p>
