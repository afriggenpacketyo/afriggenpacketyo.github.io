          <p>Hamas has stated that Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American soldier and U.S. citizen held hostage since October 7, will be released as part of ongoing ceasefire efforts. Alexander, who grew up in New Jersey, was abducted from a military base near the Gaza border during the initial Hamas attack. His parents met with both former President Biden and President Trump to advocate for his release, and it is believed that he is among the fewer than two dozen hostages thought to be alive. The release is contingent on progress towards a ceasefire, reopening crossings, and allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza, although the exact timing remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Pepper Stetler, in a New York Times guest essay, argues that President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program could drastically reduce federal oversight of special education, potentially harming the 7.5 million public school students served by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). She highlights the case of Adaline, a student with Down syndrome in Oklahoma, who faced segregation and limited learning opportunities due to district policies. Stetler contrasts this with her daughter's inclusive education in Ohio, emphasizing the risk that reduced federal oversight will lead to uneven enforcement of IDEA and erode the rights of students with disabilities. Without robust federal oversight, states will not be held accountable for meeting even the minimum requirements of IDEA.</p>

          <p>A recent interview with Prince Harry, in which he expressed a desire to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced long-standing tensions within the British royal family.

Harry's comments have drawn attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties, and some royal watchers fear that this ongoing conflict could undermine the monarchy's image of unity and inclusiveness.</p>

          <p>California, despite its status as the world's fourth-largest economy, faces a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges that threaten its long-term resilience.

The state's ability to rely on federal assistance is uncertain given President Trump's antagonistic stance towards California, and the state's political leadership is at a crossroads with an upcoming gubernatorial election.

While Republicans have successfully tapped into parental emotions in the past, Democrats are hoping to channel parents' fury and fears by addressing concerns about public health and the rising costs of raising children, though there is little evidence of an organized anti-MAHA movement.</p>
