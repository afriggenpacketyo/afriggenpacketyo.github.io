          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are arguing against the Justice Department's motion to unseal grand jury testimony related to her and Jeffrey Epstein's cases. They contend that releasing the information would violate grand jury secrecy and prejudice Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court. The filing emphasizes that Maxwell is alive and her due process rights are at stake, unlike the deceased Epstein. Meanwhile, some of Epstein's victims have supported the release of the transcripts, with redactions, to ensure full accountability for all involved parties.</p>

          <p>Economists in China are currently debating the merits of establishing official consumption benchmarks in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents, like Chang Xiuze from a national planning commission think tank, argue that setting targets for the household consumption rate could help stimulate domestic demand and improve citizens' lives. They point to China's relatively low household consumption rate of 39.6% in 2023 as an area needing strategic focus. However, other scholars express skepticism, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as effective policy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for allegedly orchestrating an illegal export scheme involving sensitive technology. The individuals are accused of shipping tens of millions of dollars' worth of controlled AI chips, including Nvidia's advanced H100 GPUs, to China without the required licenses. According to the complaint, their company, ALX Solutions, was founded shortly after U.S. export controls were implemented and used transshipment points in Malaysia and Singapore to conceal the final destination of the hardware, violating federal law.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is terminating approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The canceled projects, which include proposals from Pfizer and Moderna, were primarily focused on COVID-19 and influenza. Kennedy stated that HHS has determined the technology "poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses," a move that has drawn sharp criticism from infectious disease experts. Critics argue the decision is not based on scientific evidence and will leave the nation more vulnerable to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to formulate a plan for the disarmament of Hezbollah, aiming for state institutions to be the sole bearers of arms by the end of the year. This decision follows significant U.S. pressure and is a key component of implementing a November 2024 ceasefire agreement with Israel. The plan is scheduled for Cabinet review by the end of August. However, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem has already rejected the notion of disarming while facing what he terms Israeli aggression, creating a potential standoff.</p>

The judge found that reallocating the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and that the government's action was not consistent with congressional intent.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting a rise in flea-borne typhus infections, particularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The disease is spread by fleas that have bitten infected animals like rats, opossums, and stray cats, with cases peaking in late summer and fall. So far this year, Los Angeles County has reported 79 cases, while Long Beach is on track to surpass its previous annual record. Officials are urging residents to protect themselves and their pets by using flea control, securing trash, and avoiding contact with stray animals.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have announced they will not pursue the death penalty against three high-profile accused Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent. The decision comes despite President Trump's calls for capital punishment for drug traffickers. As Mexico has abolished capital punishment, it typically requires assurances that its citizens will not face execution as a condition of extradition, though the legal circumstances of these specific transfers were unusual and left the option open.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has secured a landmark $2 billion settlement with chemical manufacturers DuPont, Chemours, and Corteva to resolve claims related to "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other pollutants. State officials called it the largest single-state environmental settlement in U.S. history. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and fund the cleanup of contamination at four major industrial sites. It also establishes a substantial reserve fund to protect taxpayers from future costs if the companies fail to meet their obligations, holding them accountable for decades of pollution.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France, having already burned over 11,000 hectares and injured nine people, one critically. The fire, which started in the town of Ribaute, has forced the partial evacuation of villages and campgrounds. Authorities have shut down a section of the vital A9 motorway, which connects France and Spain, to combat the blaze. Over 1,200 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, are working to contain the fire amid unfavorable weather conditions, including strong winds and dry terrain.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's calls for a ceasefire, a BBC Verify analysis reveals that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since January. The analysis, based on Ukrainian Air Force data, shows a sharp increase in munitions launched compared to the final six months of the previous administration. This escalation has occurred even as the Trump administration twice paused military aid to Ukraine. The increase in attacks coincides with reports that Russia has significantly ramped up its domestic production of ballistic missiles and drones.</p>

          <p>Shares of real estate technology company Opendoor fell sharply after it issued a weak financial forecast, despite a recent surge in stock price driven by new investor interest.

CEO Carrie Wheeler acknowledged the recent "enthusiasm" from investors but noted that the housing market has "further deteriorated" due to persistently high mortgage rates suppressing buyer demand, signaling continued challenges for the iBuying business model.

          <p>A new study based on 20 years of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park reveals the crucial importance of relationships between female mountain gorillas. Researchers found that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she will actively seek out and join another female she already knows, even if they have been apart for many years. This behavior highlights that these same-sex social bonds provide key benefits, likely helping new arrivals navigate the social hierarchy and mitigate aggression from resident females. The findings reframe the understanding of female-female relationships in gorilla society.</p>

This article explores the complexities behind forecasting, noting that the atmosphere is a "chaotic system" where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating vast amounts of data and uncertainty to the public in a concise format also presents a major challenge. While new technologies like AI promise even better long-range predictions, they also introduce new complexities, reinforcing the need for clear communication from human forecasters.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they featured models who appeared "unhealthily thin" and were therefore "irresponsible." The watchdog noted that styling, shadows, and model poses made the individuals appear "gaunt" with "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which removed the images, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, reflecting ongoing scrutiny of body image representation in the fashion industry.</p>

With the average uniform costing over £340, many families find the expense unaffordable.
