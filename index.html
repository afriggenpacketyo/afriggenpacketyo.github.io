            <p>Key Democratic political organizations, including ActBlue and Indivisible, are preparing for potential criminal investigations initiated by allies of President Trump. These groups are consulting with attorneys and developing contingency plans in response to public statements from Trump allies suggesting they should face prosecution. Trump has made it clear that he intends to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries, raising concerns among Democratic institutions about politically motivated legal challenges. ActBlue, a major Democratic fundraising platform, faces allegations of campaign finance violations, while Indivisible, a protest group, has been condemned by Trump adviser Elon Musk.</p>

            <p>President Trump has controversially blamed Ukrainian President Zelensky, along with Putin and Biden, for initiating the war in Ukraine, sparking widespread criticism. This statement followed a deadly Russian attack on the city of Sumy. Trump questioned Zelensky's competence and accused him of seeking missiles, stating that Ukraine should have known it couldn't win the war. Zelensky had previously urged Trump to visit Ukraine before making any deals with Putin to end the conflict. The Russian attack on Sumy resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, further escalating tensions.</p>

            <p>Oil giant BP is being viewed as a potential takeover target, reigniting speculation of a possible merger with rivals like Shell or acquisitions by U.S. giants Exxon Mobil or Chevron. BP's recent strategic reset, focusing on core oil and gas operations while cutting renewable spending, has sparked interest in its non-core assets. Industry analysts suggest that BP's underperformance and depressed share price make it an attractive target in the current wave of consolidation within the energy sector. However, antitrust concerns and Shell's commitment to capital discipline could complicate a potential deal. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has launched a national security investigation into semiconductor imports, potentially leading to new tariffs. This investigation encompasses a wide range of items, including chip components, chipmaking equipment, and downstream products containing semiconductors. The investigation aims to assess the feasibility of increasing domestic semiconductor capacity and whether trade measures, including tariffs, are necessary to protect national security. This move has significant implications for Trump's global trade war, with the U.S. heavily reliant on semiconductor technology imported from countries like Taiwan and South Korea.</p>

            <p>Hungary's parliament has passed a constitutional amendment allowing the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities, sparking criticism and protests. The amendment prioritizes children's rights to moral, physical, and spiritual development over the right to peacefully assemble. This move codifies a law that bans LGBTQ+ public events, including Pride, and allows authorities to use facial recognition to identify attendees. Critics argue that this is another step toward authoritarianism by Prime Minister Orb√°n's government, which has campaigned against LGBTQ+ communities in recent years.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the need for more selective hitting, and the team adjusted their batting practice routine to improve against fastballs.

            <p>Senior advisers close to President Trump reportedly warned him about the potential devastating effects of his tariff proposals on global financial markets and the U.S. economy. Internal disagreements arose before the announcement, with some leaders predicting serious economic instability. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pushed for a more calculated rollout with targeted tariffs, while others advocated for no negotiations. Financial markets reacted negatively after the announcement, leading to a partial pause of the tariffs after 90 days.</p>
