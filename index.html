          <p>In the sex trafficking trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, jury deliberations have been complicated by a note from the foreperson expressing concern about another juror. The note claims that Juror #25, a scientist with a Ph.D., is struggling to follow the judge's legal instructions, prompting a request for judicial intervention. Judge Arun Subramanian is currently deciding on the appropriate course of action to address the potential confusion and ensure the integrity of the deliberation process. The jury had only been deliberating for about 70 minutes before this issue was raised, halting progress in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Efforts toward transitional justice in Syria are facing significant challenges and public anger following the new government's establishment of justice commissions. The release of former Assad regime figures accused of atrocities, such as the Tadamon massacre, in the name of reconciliation has sparked outrage among victims' families. Critics, including human rights organizations, argue the commissions' mandates are too narrow, focusing only on Assad-era crimes and ignoring offenses by other groups. This lack of transparency and perceived impunity has eroded public trust and led to a rise in vigilante justice, complicating the nation's fragile peace process.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of President Trump's major legislative bill introduces a new excise tax on wind and solar projects, a move projected to increase consumer energy prices and cost the industry billions by 2036. This provision, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing by penalizing the use of components from countries like China, would apply to new projects and those coming into service after 2027. The bill also accelerates the phasing out of existing renewable energy tax credits. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from the renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions, and even some conservative experts for potentially stifling growth and costing American jobs.</p>

This increase coincides with the Trump administration's aggressive deportation efforts and has led to detention facilities operating far beyond their stated capacity. Immigration advocates and attorneys attribute the rise in fatalities to deteriorating conditions within the strained system, describing the current situation as horrendous.

          <p>A federal investigation by the Trump administration has found that Harvard University violated civil rights law by failing to adequately protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment on campus. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights stated that its investigation uncovered a pattern of "unlawful and unchecked discrimination" since October 2023. The findings, which Harvard strongly disputes, put the university at risk of losing federal funding. In response, Harvard asserted it has taken numerous steps to combat antisemitism and remains committed to supporting its Jewish and Israeli community members.</p>

This effort aims to counter the Republican agenda and address lessons learned from the 2024 election defeats.

          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is facing persistent questioning from her own Labour MPs regarding the government's plan to reform the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefit system. After a partial U-turn, the government announced that stricter eligibility criteria would only apply to new claimants after November 2026, but backbenchers are questioning the logic of setting new criteria before a planned review of the assessment process is complete. The controversy arose after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to block the bill, forcing the government to make concessions that will reduce projected savings from the reforms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has suffered its most significant decline for a first half-year since 1973, falling over 10% against a basket of major currencies.

Rising expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts have also contributed to the currency's weakness.

The 3% levy would have primarily impacted major U.S. tech companies, and President Trump had labeled it a "blatant attack" on the U.S., freezing trade talks in response. By shelving the tax, Canada has successfully brought the U.S. back to the negotiating table for a critical trade and defense deal.

This article argues that efficiently 'killing the tail' is a vital, often overlooked, aspect of Test cricket, providing a psychological lift and preventing momentum shifts.

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis examines the significant increase in working-age adults in the UK claiming disability or incapacity benefits, which has risen from 1 in 13 in 2019 to 1 in 10 in 2025. A primary driver appears to be a rise in claims citing mental health conditions, particularly among younger claimants. Other contributing factors may include the rising state pension age, which expands the working-age population pool, and a greater public awareness of benefit eligibility following the pandemic. The government's planned reforms to the system are now facing scrutiny as these trends continue to put pressure on public finances.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court to Hear Major Campaign Finance Case Challenging Spending Limits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 12:58:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a significant campaign finance case next term that challenges long-standing restrictions on how much political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates. The appeal was brought by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which argues the limits violate the First Amendment. In a rare alignment, the Trump administration's Department of Justice agrees with the challengers, leaving the restrictions undefended. The court has granted the Democratic National Committee permission to intervene and argue in defense of the existing law, setting the stage for a major ruling on political spending.</p>

          <h2>Man, 92, Convicted in 1967 Cold Case Murder, One of UK's Oldest Solved</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 12:58:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark legal case, a 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted of the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in 1967, solving one of the United Kingdom's longest-running cold cases. The breakthrough came after investigators re-examined evidence in 2023, using modern forensic techniques to find Headley's DNA on the victim's skirt, which had been preserved for 58 years. This DNA evidence, along with a palm print from the scene, conclusively linked him to the crime. The conviction brings long-awaited justice and closure to the victim's family after nearly six decades.</p>
