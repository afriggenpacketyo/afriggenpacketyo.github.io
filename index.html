          <p>Russian and Ukrainian forces engaged in extensive overnight aerial assaults, resulting in at least four fatalities and numerous injuries across both nations. Ukrainian officials reported significant damage in the Dnipro, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions from a combination of drones, missiles, and guided bombs. Concurrently, Russian authorities stated that Ukrainian drone attacks targeted several border regions, including Rostov where two people were killed, and prompted temporary flight halts at multiple airports. The reciprocal strikes highlight the escalating and destructive nature of the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Renewed border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have intensified, leading to at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people from border villages in both countries. Both nations have traded accusations of initiating attacks involving artillery and gunfire, expanding the conflict zone and prompting the recall of their respective ambassadors. International bodies, including the UN Security Council and ASEAN, are calling for an immediate ceasefire and urging a peaceful resolution through mediation. The conflict stems from a long-standing border dispute, with recent tensions reignited by a landmine incident.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan's Opposition Lawmakers Survive Unprecedented Recall Vote</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 07:01:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political event in Taiwan known as the "Great Recall," all targeted opposition lawmakers from the Kuomintang party have successfully retained their seats. The vote was initiated by a civic movement accusing the lawmakers of being excessively aligned with China and obstructing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's agenda. Despite large-scale mobilization by pro-recall activists, the turnout and support were insufficient to oust any of the legislators, thereby preserving the opposition's majority in parliament. The outcome is expected to deepen political polarization on the island ahead of another recall round in August.</p>

          <p>At a major conference in Shanghai, influential AI expert Geoffrey Hinton urged for collaboration between the United States and China to manage the risks of advanced artificial intelligence. He acknowledged that national interests diverge on issues like cyberattacks and autonomous weapons but emphasized a shared existential concern that "no country wants AI to take over." Hinton compared the potential danger of superintelligent AI to a pet tiger cub that could grow to become uncontrollable. He stressed that international cooperation, similar to Cold War-era nuclear non-proliferation talks, is essential to prevent such a scenario.</p>

This milestone occurs as the agency faces political headwinds, including past threats from the Trump administration to privatize it or merge it with another department. The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has affirmed his commitment to keeping the USPS an independent agency, separate from direct government control.</p>

          <p>Wesleyan University President Michael Roth argues that the American right, guided by plans like Project 2025, is waging a calculated war on higher education to undermine civil society. In an interview, he states that this campaign targets high-profile universities to erode sources of legitimacy that are independent of White House ideology, leading to self-censorship and intellectual conformity. While acknowledging that universities have problems, such as ideological narrowness among faculty and prizing exclusivity, Roth contends these are not the root cause of the current political attacks. He asserts that this assault threatens the democratic function of universities as places for experimentation and critical inquiry.</p>

Survivors and local leaders believe the violence is a targeted campaign by armed herders to displace Christian farming communities from their fertile land.

These captive primates frequently suffer from severe stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage, living in unsuitable conditions away from their own kind.

          <p>A significant number of Americans with high incomes, sometimes exceeding $300,000 annually, report not feeling wealthy and often struggle with debt. This phenomenon, termed "HENRYs" (high earners, not rich yet), is attributed to factors like rising living costs, substantial debt burdens, and lifestyle inflation that consumes increased earnings. Experts note a psychological paradox where accumulating wealth requires saving, which conflicts with the feeling of richness derived from spending. Consequently, many high earners feel trapped on a financial hamster wheel, experiencing more money-related anxiety than when they earned less. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent large-scale ICE raid on Glass House Brands, a major licensed cannabis operator in California, has sent shockwaves through the state's legal marijuana industry. The raid, which resulted in the detention of 361 people and one worker's death, has fueled confusion and fear about the federal government's stance on state-legal cannabis businesses. Federal officials cited concerns about child labor and criminal activity, while the company maintains it follows all employment laws. The incident highlights the precarious position of the cannabis industry, which operates legally under state law but remains illegal federally, creating significant risks for both businesses and their workers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Most Immigrants Arrested in LA Raids Have No Criminal Record</h2>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about deporting the "worst of the worst," an analysis of ICE data reveals a starkly different reality in the Los Angeles area. In June, nearly seven out of ten immigrants arrested had no criminal convictions, a sharp increase from previous months. This trend suggests that to meet aggressive arrest quotas, enforcement has shifted from targeting serious criminals to sweeping up ordinary, undocumented individuals, including garment workers and vendors. Critics argue this approach undermines public safety claims and is causing support for the administration's immigration policies to decline as the human impact becomes more visible.</p>

This divergence shows that businesses heavily reliant on imports are feeling the immediate strain, while others remain largely insulated. As an August 1st deadline for new tariff deals looms, uncertainty persists about the final costs for businesses and how much will ultimately be passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to nutrition experts, bison is emerging as a healthier alternative to traditional beef for burgers and other meals. Registered dietitians highlight that bison meat contains fewer calories, less total and saturated fat, and lower cholesterol compared to beef, while offering similar or higher levels of essential nutrients like iron, B12, and zinc. Its lower saturated fat content makes it particularly beneficial for cardiovascular health. While beef may be better for those needing higher calorie intake, such as athletes, bison's leaner profile and slightly sweeter taste make it an excellent choice for health-conscious consumers.</p>

Many describe the move as "coming home," reconnecting with their ancestral roots and finding a community where they feel more accepted than in the U.S. Those who have moved cite Kenya's welcoming culture and tropical climate as major draws, establishing businesses and enjoying a more peaceful lifestyle. This trend is driven less by a specific political administration and more by a long-term desire for a change from systemic issues in America.</p>

This incident is one of many where immigrants attending their required court dates are being arrested, often to be placed in fast-tracked deportation proceedings.

The median price for an existing home reached a record $435,300 in June, yet sales fell to a nine-month low. Experts explain this trend by pointing to a market of "haves and have-nots," where all-cash buyers and those with significant housing equity can afford the high prices, particularly in the luxury segment. Meanwhile, high mortgage rates and soaring prices continue to shut out many first-time and middle-income buyers, creating a challenging and divided market. (not investment advice)</p>

The situation is complicated by Turkey, which opposes Kurdish autonomy and has reportedly been asked by Damascus for military support.
