          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is set to close its Office of Research and Development, the primary scientific analysis arm for environmental policy. The move is part of a broader plan to reduce the EPA's staff by 23%, which the administration claims will save money and streamline the agency's mission. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, warning it will cripple the EPA's ability to use science in protecting public health and safety. The agency states it will create a new "Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions" to prioritize research in rulemaking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, outlines the precarious situation for American businesses operating in China. He suggests that the current 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, as a return to high-tariff conflict is undesirable for both nations. Stein notes that while China has taken steps on fentanyl precursors, the US has yet to reciprocate by lowering related tariffs, hindering a return to a more normal trade relationship. The business community remains concerned that bilateral discussions are overly focused on tariffs, neglecting broader economic issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The legal proceedings for the 9/11 cases at Guantanamo Bay face an uncertain future following the cancellation of previously negotiated plea deals. According to Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck, this development resets the long-stalled military commissions. The trials of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants have been mired in legal and procedural challenges for years. The collapse of the plea agreements, which would have taken the death penalty off the table, reopens complex questions about how to achieve justice for the attacks.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in a tragic accident at a medical facility on Long Island, New York, after being pulled into a running MRI machine. The man, identified by his wife as Keith McAllister, was reportedly wearing a heavy 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnetic field drew him in, resulting in a fatal "medical episode." This incident highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn any magnetic metal object into a dangerous projectile.</p>

The election also saw a surge for the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which complicates the political landscape by appealing to anti-immigration and anti-globalist sentiments.

Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to halve sewage spills by 2030. While the plan is welcomed by some, critics argue it may be insufficient to solve the deep-rooted problems of under-investment and environmental damage within the industry.</p>

She heavily criticized the tactics of federal agents, describing "masked men in unmarked cars" snatching people off the street, which she argued does not constitute legitimate law enforcement.

          <p>Following a week of deadly sectarian violence in Suweida, southern Syria, Bedouin fighters have stated they will observe a ceasefire but may resume hostilities if their demands are not met. The clashes, which also involved government forces and Israeli air strikes supporting the Druze, have killed over 1,120 people and displaced more than 128,000. Bedouin fighters are demanding the release of their injured members from Suweida, which is now back under Druze control. Tensions remain high, with a fragile "cautious calm" reported in the region amid a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he may block a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team changes its name back to the "Washington Redskins." The team dropped its former name in 2020 amid pressure from sponsors and Native American groups who view it as a slur. In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the old name and that the heritage of Native Americans is being "systematically taken away." The team hopes to build a new stadium on federal land, a deal that requires congressional and city approval.</p>
