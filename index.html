          <p>Actor Ty Burrell, known for his role as Phil Dunphy on "Modern Family," has expressed no regrets about leaving Los Angeles for a quieter life in Salt Lake City, Utah. He moved with his wife and daughters after the show concluded, embracing an outdoorsy lifestyle that he didn't experience growing up. While he is open to returning to acting, he currently focuses on voiceover work, which allows more family time. Several of his "Modern Family" co-stars, including Ariel Winter and Eric Stonestreet, have also relocated from Hollywood, citing desires for a more normal life and to escape the pressures of stardom.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has reported that an Israeli military strike on its headquarters in Khan Younis, Gaza, resulted in the death of one staff member and injured three others. The aid group stated the attack was deliberate, as the building was clearly marked with the protective red emblem and its location was known to the Israeli military. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has stated it is reviewing the claim. This incident adds to the growing number of humanitarian workers killed during the conflict and has prompted renewed calls for accountability and the protection of aid personnel in the region.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have confirmed the death of Khamis Ayyad, a Palestinian-American man in his 40s, who died from smoke inhalation in the West Bank village of Silwad. The Palestinian health ministry attributed his death to fires set by Israeli settlers on homes and vehicles. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence and is providing consular assistance to the family. This is the second death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank in recent weeks, occurring amidst a documented rise in settler attacks and Israeli military operations since the war in Gaza began.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian institution has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments in its National Museum for American History exhibit in the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed, sparking fears of historical whitewashing. In a statement, the Smithsonian denied any political pressure, explaining the placard was removed because it did not meet the museum's presentation standards. The section on presidential power limits already includes materials on the impeachments of Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, and the new display will bring Trump's impeachments back into this historical context.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix after a tense battle with his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who finished second. Norris executed a bold one-stop strategy, which required a masterful defensive drive in the final laps to hold off Piastri's charge on fresher tires. George Russell of Mercedes claimed the final podium spot, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who started on pole, faded to fourth. The victory narrows the gap between Norris and Piastri in the championship standings as Formula 1 heads into its summer break, marking a significant result for both the driver and the McLaren team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun its August recess without reaching an agreement to advance dozens of Donald Trump's presidential nominees, following a contentious standoff between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have been blocking fast-track votes, forcing lengthy roll-call procedures for each nominee. Negotiations broke down after President Trump publicly told Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL!" on social media. Republicans are now considering changing Senate rules to expedite confirmations upon their return, a move Democrats warn would be a "huge mistake" and further escalate partisan obstruction in the chamber.</p>

Greer explained that the President views tariffs as a tool to reduce trade deficits and reshore manufacturing, sometimes preferring them over negotiated deals. He also addressed the use of tariffs for geopolitical leverage, citing actions against Canada and Brazil as responses to non-trade issues like fentanyl trafficking or perceived "lawfare" against political allies. Greer maintained that these actions are legally permissible under acts like IEEPA and are a lesser step than full sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's birth rate has fallen to a new low of 1.35 children per woman, sparking a debate about its societal and economic implications. Experts suggest that multiple ongoing crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and inflation, are contributing to a sense of uncertainty among young people. The discussion also highlights a "fertility gap," where people desire more children than they actually have, often due to a lack of reliable childcare and work-life balance. Sociologists warn that without improved family-friendly policies, Germany faces long-term risks to its social insurance systems, pension security, and overall economic prosperity as the population shrinks.</p>

The piece humorously rewrites tour guide scripts for places like Stonewall, Manzanar, and Gettysburg, presenting them in a way that avoids controversial history or reinterprets it to fit a sanitized narrative. For example, the Selma to Montgomery trail is described as a scenic walk, and the Civil War is portrayed as being fought "over nothing."

          <p>The U.S. auto market is showing signs of severe distress, with a record-high percentage of subprime borrowers falling behind on their loan payments. This crisis stems from inflated car prices during the pandemic, followed by declining vehicle values and rising interest rates, leaving many owners with negative equity. The situation is expected to worsen due to new tariffs on imported cars, which could further increase costs for consumers and strain manufacturers. For individuals struggling with auto loan debt, experts suggest considering refinancing, trading in for a cheaper model, or selling a second vehicle to reduce financial exposure.

          <p>Divorce attorneys advise that individuals in a rocky marriage can take steps to protect their finances, even without a prenuptial agreement. One key recommendation is to ensure full transparency and access to all joint financial information, including accounts, assets, and liabilities, while still married. This proactive approach prevents being locked out of accounts and provides a clear financial picture if a divorce proceeds. Another protective measure is a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided. These steps can provide security and clarity for both parties.</p>

This approach is designed to make a child feel safe and understood, which helps their nervous system regulate more quickly. By reassuring the child and setting compassionate boundaries without shame, parents can de-escalate outbursts and teach their children healthier ways to process and express their emotions over time.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it is working "at pace" on a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical care in the country. While a small number of children have been brought to the UK through private initiatives, this would be the first government-led medical evacuation scheme of the conflict. The plan, which could be operational within weeks and may involve up to 300 children, follows a Foreign Affairs Committee report that criticized the government's previous inaction. The move is a response to the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where many children have been killed or injured.</p>

          <p>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue early retirement by adopting principles of extreme saving and mindful spending. Proponents aim to accumulate 25 times their annual expenses in investments, allowing them to live off a 4% annual withdrawal. The philosophy emphasizes prioritizing life experiences over material consumption. Adherents focus on defining what is "enough" for a happy life, thereby liberating their time from the traditional career path to pursue personal passions and family life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a commentary, author Rebecca Solnit argues that high-profile cases of sexual abuse, like those involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, should not be viewed as shocking aberrations but as part of a pervasive, systemic pattern of violence against women. She contends that treating these as individual stories masks the root cause of misogyny and prevents society from addressing the issue systemically. The constant threat of violence shapes the lives of all women and girls, acting as an engine of inequality. Solnit calls for a broader conversation that recognizes this ubiquitous violence as a pandemic requiring deep social change.</p>
