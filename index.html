          <p>French President Macron stated that Israel should not be given a 'free pass' regarding its operations in Gaza, leading to increased tensions between France and Israel. Israel has accused Macron of leading a 'crusade against the Jewish state' in response to his criticism. The exchanges between the two nations represent a significant deterioration in their diplomatic relationship. The international community continues to monitor the situation in Gaza and calls for de-escalation. Optimism regarding the situation is tempered by the ongoing conflict and diplomatic fallout.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is set to leave his position as a 'special government employee' in the Trump administration, with his departure commencing Wednesday night. Musk thanked President Trump on X, stating that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team will continue its work throughout the government. Due to his role as a special government employee, Musk was limited to a 130-day appointment, which he is nearing. Despite leaving his official role, Musk will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president and may attend White House meetings, but senior White House officials expressed frustration with Musk's comments regarding Trump's agenda and policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service reported an increase in dog attacks on postal workers, with over 6,000 incidents occurring last year, marking a rise of at least 200 cases since 2023. California had the highest number of incidents with 701, followed by Texas and Ohio. The USPS recommends securing dogs before mail carriers arrive or keeping them leashed, and advises against children taking mail directly from carriers to prevent perceived threats. The USPS emphasizes that dog bite attacks are preventable and promotes responsible pet ownership, encouraging owners to teach their dogs appropriate behavior and commands.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating whether a man who allegedly threatened to shoot and kill President Trump may have been framed. Ramon Morales Reyes was arrested by ICE agents after allegedly writing a threatening letter, but law enforcement sources now suggest the letter may have been sent by someone else. Reyes submitted to a handwriting test that did not match the letter, leading investigators to believe he was involved in a dispute with another man who wanted to prevent him from testifying. The investigation is ongoing, with the Milwaukee Police Department also investigating an identity theft and victim intimidation incident related to the case.</p>

          <p>Following the approval of flag football as an Olympic sport in 2028, former NFL center Jason Kelce proposed a competition between NFL players and established flag football players to determine who represents Team USA.

          <p>The search for Grant Hardin, a convicted killer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks" who escaped from a medium-security prison in Arkansas, has been complicated by heavy rain. Bloodhounds initially tracked Hardin's scent, but the trail was lost due to the weather, prompting the FBI to offer a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his arrest. Hardin, a former police chief, was serving a 30-year sentence for murder and a 50-year sentence for sexual assault. The escape is under investigation, and authorities are using various methods to locate Hardin in the rugged Ozark Mountains.</p>

Sunny and its sibling Gizmo, who are about 3 feet tall with a wingspan of over 5 feet, are expected to fledge soon.

          <p>This opinion piece criticizes Elon Musk's involvement in government, particularly his role in significantly reducing the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The author argues that Musk's efforts to cut government spending have resulted in the termination of numerous USAID grants, leading to an estimated 300,000 deaths, mostly children. The piece cites reports of increased HIV cases and severe malnutrition in regions affected by the aid cuts. The author contrasts the White House's denial of these fatal consequences with on-the-ground reports from aid workers and health professionals.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams won a libel case against the BBC over a documentary that claimed he sanctioned the 2006 murder of a British spy, Denis Donaldson. The High Court in Dublin awarded Adams damages of 100,000 euros ($113,000) after the jury found the BBC had defamed him in a 2016 Spotlight documentary. Adams has consistently denied being a member of the IRA and stated the BBC's journalism was not fair, responsible, or in the public interest. The BBC expressed disappointment with the verdict, defending its editorial processes and journalistic diligence.</p>

Others believe that bankers are generally more cautious in their public statements to avoid reputational damage.
