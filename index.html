          <p>Vox reports that many voters who supported Donald Trump in the 2024 election, including Black, Latino, and young voters, are now expressing regret due to his perceived failure to improve the economy and address inflation.

While they are dissatisfied with Trump, they are not necessarily returning to the Democratic Party, indicating a broader disillusionment with the political system. The article highlights the need for both parties to address the concerns of these disaffected voters to avoid losing their support in future elections. </p>

          <p>G.O.P. leaders are exploring cuts to federal aid, leaving some states fearful that their budgets cannot absorb billions of dollars in new costs. State leaders are beginning to express alarm about the budgetary fallout from President Trump’s economic agenda, warning that they will not be able to pick up the bill if the federal government reduces its funding for major public services. Republicans have framed their thinking as a matter of fiscal necessity and federalism, arguing that states should shoulder more of the financial burden for their citizens at a time when the national debt exceeds $36 trillion. Under Mr. Trump’s budget, housing programs would be cut by $26 billion next year, as part of an overhaul meant to shift more of the burden of managing rental assistance to the states.</p>
