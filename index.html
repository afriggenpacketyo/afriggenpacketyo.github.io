          <p>The Israeli army admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23rd. Initially, the army claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached "suspiciously" in darkness without headlights, but video footage revealed the vehicles were clearly marked with lights on. The army insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, but has provided no evidence and admits they were unarmed when soldiers opened fire. The Red Crescent and international organizations are calling for an independent investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Massive demonstrations known as "Hands Off!" took place in over 1,200 locations across all 50 US states, protesting the actions of President Trump and his billionaire advisor Elon Musk. Organized by over 150 groups, including civil rights organizations and labor unions, the protests targeted issues ranging from federal worker layoffs to immigrant deportations and cuts in social programs. Demonstrators voiced anger over the administrationâ€™s moves to fire thousands of federal workers, close social security administration field offices, effectively shutter entire agencies, deport immigrants, scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs. The protests also occurred in a dozen cities overseas.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed to protect British businesses from the "tariff storm" resulting from President Trump's new tariffs, indicating a willingness to use industrial policy to shield the national interest. While seeking an economic deal with the US to avoid some tariffs, Starmer has not ruled out further tax rises and is prepared to take a "cool-headed" approach rather than immediately retaliating. Britain was hit with a 10% import duty rate, along with a 25% tariff on UK car exports, steel, and aluminum products. The UK government published a 400-page list of US goods it could include in any possible tariff response.</p>

          <p>President Trump's implementation of 25% tariffs on imported cars has triggered significant responses from automakers, including job cuts, pauses in car shipments, and delayed price increases. Stellantis announced temporary production halts and layoffs at Midwest factories, while Jaguar Land Rover paused shipments to the U.S. Buyers are rushing to dealerships to take advantage of pre-tariff pricing, while some companies are absorbing tariff costs or freezing prices temporarily. The tariffs also apply to imported car parts, potentially increasing costs for cars assembled in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every product entering the US is viewed as a significant shift away from globalization and free trade, potentially undermining the foundation of US economic might. Experts warn that these protectionist measures could lead to a trade war, increased inflation, and a recession. The article explores the historical context of US trade policies and the potential consequences of Trump's approach. The long-term aim is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit down to zero.</p>

          <p>Government attorneys are arguing that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis had ordered the administration to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. by Monday night. The government contends that such an order infringes on executive power and involves compelling action by a foreign sovereign. The White House continues to claim that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, a claim his attorneys deny.</p>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump that was publicly criticized by the president, says her business is now "in danger of not recovering." Trump called the portrait "truly the worst" and claimed it was "purposefully distorted," leading to its removal from Colorado's State Capitol. Boardman says the criticism has negatively impacted her business, as she feels her "intentions, integrity, and abilities" have been "called into question". She also described how "for the six years that the portrait hung in the Colorado State Capitol Building Rotunda, I received overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback".</p>

          <p>Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has introduced a novel method to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Developed in collaboration with Tsinghua University, the technique combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The new method is aimed to enable LLMs to deliver better and faster results to general queries. The academic paper, published on the online scientific paper repository arXiv, comes amid speculation about the start-upâ€™s next move following the global attention garnered by the firmâ€™s V3 foundation model and R1 reasoning model.</p>
