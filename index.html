          <p>Amber Smith, wife of former country star Granger Smith, has shared harrowing details from her forthcoming memoir about her husband's near-suicide attempt in 2019. Following the tragic drowning of their three-year-old son River, Granger, overwhelmed by grief and alcohol, put a gun to his mouth. Amber recounts his later confession about how close he was to pulling the trigger, before he found solace and turned to faith. The couple, who welcomed another son in 2021, are now advocates for children's water safety.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the deployment of DOJ agents to ICE facilities nationwide, citing an "onslaught of violence" against federal officers and property. This action follows President Trump's memorandum targeting "domestic terrorism" and "organized political violence." Bondi stated the DOJ would pursue serious charges, including terrorism offenses, against individuals involved in these acts. This development unfolds amidst ongoing tensions and protests, particularly in cities like Portland and Chicago, where federal agents have been met with resistance.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that a return of Donald Trump to power could mark a significant shift in US-China relations, moving beyond traditional ideological frameworks. The author posits a 'reverse convergence,' where the US might adopt a similar approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace as China, rather than imposing liberal democratic values. This analysis challenges the long-held Western 'convergence theory,' arguing it oversimplifies global social change and power dynamics between nations.</p>

Three people died in Globe, with two found in a vehicle and one in floodwaters, while another fatality occurred near Phoenix. The National Weather Service reported Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport experienced its highest one-day rainfall in nearly seven years.

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed at least 91 people across Gaza, with incidents reported in the Nuseirat refugee camp and Gaza City, impacting families and displaced persons. This escalation occurs despite increasing international pressure for a ceasefire, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defiantly rejected at the UN General Assembly. Hospitals in Gaza City are on the brink of collapse due to damage and severe shortages, while aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders have suspended operations due to safety risks. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 65,000 deaths in Gaza since October 2023.</p>

Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and farmers Sarah and Craig Taylor cultivated nine varieties, including basmati and risotto, benefiting from the hottest summer on record. This ambitious project, led by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food security and climate change adaptation. Growing rice on peat soils could also help lock away greenhouse gases, offering a dual solution for environmental and agricultural challenges.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran, freezing assets, halting arms deals, and penalizing ballistic missile development, effective Sunday. Triggered by France, Germany, and the UK, these 'snapback' sanctions come after Iran's continued non-compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal commitments and increased uranium enrichment. The move intensifies pressure on Iran's already reeling economy, where the rial is at a record low, driving up food prices and exacerbating public anxiety.

He details his evolving views on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, emphasizing that 'the cases swung, not me.' The article highlights his personal journey, including a reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia, and his Western roots, which he views as central to his judicial philosophy.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas resulted in one detainee killed and two critically injured. The shooter, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and was found with anti-ICE messages engraved on shell casings, indicating a targeted attack. The deceased victim was identified as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, with Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Jose Andres Bordones-Molina critically wounded. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric, and ordered increased security at facilities nationwide. This incident follows previous threats and attacks on ICE facilities in Texas.</p>

          <h2>Expert Analysis: Do Collagen Supplements Effectively Reduce Skin Ageing?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, consulting dermatologists and individuals who use them. While some users report brighter skin and stronger hair/nails, experts like consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth remain skeptical due to the complex journey collagen peptides must make through the body to reach skin cells. Studies funded by the wellness industry suggest benefits, but independent research shows no significant effect. Dermatologists recommend marine collagen over vegan options, but ultimately advise sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful anti-aging strategies than costly supplements.</p>

          <p>Bali, a famed tropical paradise, is increasingly disappointing tourists who encounter crowds, traffic, and construction, a stark contrast to its idealized social media image. Recent floods, exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked urban development, have underscored the strain on the island. While millions flock to Bali, the rapid growth in tourism has transformed once-serene areas into congested hubs, leading to concerns about cultural erosion and environmental impact. Local government has pledged to restrict new construction, and grassroots efforts are promoting sustainable development to preserve the island's natural beauty.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing "full force" if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. Trump stated the move aims to protect ICE facilities from "Antifa and other domestic terrorists," a group he formally designated as a domestic terrorist organization. This action expands the deployment of troops in American cities amidst the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. Democratic lawmakers and local officials, including Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, have pushed back, calling the deployment an abuse of power and urging peaceful resistance.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a powerful Category 5 storm, is swirling north of the Caribbean and may interact with another developing tropical depression, Imelda, in the western Atlantic. While an unlikely outcome, this potential collision could lead to the rare Fujiwhara effect, where two storms merge or orbit a common center. Meteorologists indicate that if an interaction occurs, Humberto's greater strength would likely absorb the weaker Imelda, rather than a prolonged 'dance.' Forecasters expect Humberto to pass west of Bermuda, while Imelda could bring heavy rainfall to the Bahamas and southeastern US coastline, prompting South Carolina to declare a state of emergency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The image shows Trump shouting "YOU'RE FIRED!" to Powell, who is holding a box of belongings. Trump has consistently criticized Powell for his cautious approach to interest rates, nicknaming him "Too Late Powell." While no US president has ever successfully fired a Fed chair, and the Supreme Court recently indicated a president lacks such authority, Trump's actions signal continued pressure on the central bank, raising concerns among economists about Fed independence.

This action aligns with Trump's 'I am your retribution' promise, targeting perceived enemies. The indictment, a two-page document signed by a newly sworn-in US attorney, alleges false statements to Congress, a claim previously investigated and deemed improbable by the inspector general.
