            <p>The Trump administration announced new fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports following a U.S. Trade Representative investigation that found China's shipbuilding practices unreasonable and restrictive to U.S. commerce.

This shift could free up resources for higher-priority and foreign inspections, though some higher-risk inspections would remain with the FDA.</p>

In recent weeks Russia has launched a fresh military push across the 600-mile (1,000km) frontline and stepped up its air attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump’s trade war may be a threat to China’s economy, but it may also offer a chance to improve relations with Europe and its neighbours in Asia, as well as “rehabilitating” its image internationally, according to analysts. Beijing has already started working to improve relations with these countries and forge alternative trade agreements and partnerships. Washington has imposed tariffs totalling 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far this year, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Underground comix have a heritage distinct from the humorous strips found in newspapers. They’re a gleeful blend of art and writing with roots in 1960s counterculture, X-rated cartoons, and the alternative press. Robert Crumb is one of the genre’s most influential figures. Diane DiMassa’s Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist, which was drawn in the 1990s, is another set of underground comics that also presents a world of unrestrained, gleeful havoc, though from a very different perspective.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration’s tariff war with China is most often seen through the lens of the economy. But to many economists, the bigger threat is that Trump’s global trade gambit will erode the United States’ main source of global authority: the long-term geopolitical relationships it has cultivated over nearly a century. A global trade war — or even just a war between the U.S. and China — would likely undermine efforts to build international consensus on a variety of non-economic issues, from eradicating global disease and climate change to the war on drugs.</p>

The trade levies are equivalent to a 28 percent sales tax on foreign parts and products, the highest effective rate since 1901, according to calculations by Yale’s Budget Lab.</p>
