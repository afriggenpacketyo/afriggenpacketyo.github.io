          <p>The White House announced a trade deal with China following weekend negotiations, but specifics remain unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent characterized the talks as "productive" and promised a more detailed briefing soon. While details are scarce, any reduction in trade war tensions could offer relief to the global economy, which has been strained since President Trump's tariff announcement in April. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described the discussions as constructive and expressed confidence that the agreement would address national security concerns related to trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its intention to release Edan Alexander, a US-Israeli hostage, as a gesture to advance ceasefire negotiations in Gaza. Alexander, a 21-year-old soldier, is the last known living American hostage held in the territory. This move follows direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official in Qatar, focused on securing a truce and facilitating humanitarian aid. The release is contingent on a temporary halt to Israeli military activity and aerial operations during the handover, according to a senior Palestinian official. The Israeli prime minister's office acknowledged the US notification of Hamas's intent but emphasized continued commitment to war objectives.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C., and Texas. This resettlement follows President Trump's executive order to prioritize Afrikaners, citing government-sponsored race-based discrimination, a claim strongly denied by South Africa's government. The initiative has sparked controversy, contrasting with the Trump administration's restrictive refugee policies. South Africa's foreign ministry criticized the move as politically motivated, while the U.S. State Department emphasized prioritizing Afrikaners facing racial discrimination.</p>

Ukrainian President Zelensky responded by stating he would personally attend negotiations, contingent on Russia halting hostilities. The Trump administration has aligned with Russia on a UN vote and resumed diplomatic ties, while maintaining existing economic sanctions.</p>

The representatives claimed immigration officials had opportunities to de-escalate the situation before arresting Baraka for trespassing. Homeland security officials have accused the Congress members of staging a "bizarre political stunt" and threatened to arrest them. The incident occurred at Delaney Hall, a facility recently reopened by ICE and operated by Geo Group, which has faced legal challenges in New Jersey.</p>
