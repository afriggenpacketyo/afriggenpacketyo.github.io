          <p>A 27-year-old man opened fire at a U.S. Border Patrol annex in McAllen, Texas, before being killed by responding agents. The shooter, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, was armed with an assault rifle and wearing a utility vest. The incident resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to two officers and a Border Patrol employee, who were subsequently hospitalized. Authorities are investigating the motive, noting the man had recently been reported missing from a nearby town and had no known criminal record.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the high-profile Karen Read case, from the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, to her recent acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges. It covers the prosecution's claims that she struck him with her SUV and the defense's argument of an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The summary details key evidence, witness testimonies, the first trial's mistrial, and the final verdict where she was convicted only of driving under the influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to levy 25% blanket tariffs on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. The announcement was made via letters to the leaders of both nations, which were subsequently shared by Donald Trump. These tariffs are noted to be separate from any additional sector-specific duties and include measures to prevent transshipping, a practice used to evade such economic penalties.

          <p>Keith Siegel, an American-Israeli man held by Hamas for 484 days, has publicly stated his belief that President Donald Trump can broker a deal to free the remaining hostages.

          <p>A public feud has erupted between Donald Trump and Elon Musk following Musk's announcement of a new political party, the "America Party." Trump derided the move as "ridiculous" and a "train wreck," asserting that third parties only create disruption and chaos. The disagreement stems from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending plans, which soured a previously close relationship that saw Musk support Trump's election and lead a government efficiency task force.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The announcement came as the bloc of developing nations, including China and Russia, held a summit and issued a statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. Trump did not specify which policies he considers "anti-American," but the move signals a further escalation of his administration's aggressive trade and tariff strategies.
