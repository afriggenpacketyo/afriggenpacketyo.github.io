          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:12:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo has announced the launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, set to be available this fall, as it adapts to declining traditional soda sales. This move follows the company's recent acquisition of Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda brand, and reflects a broader strategy to appeal to health-conscious consumers. The new beverage will contain three grams of prebiotic fiber and five grams of cane sugar, positioning it competitively against rivals like Olipop. The launch comes as PepsiCo's North American beverage volume has shrunk, highlighting the company's pivot towards functional and healthier drink options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Quarterback Jake Retzlaff has verbally committed to transfer to Tulane after withdrawing from BYU. His departure from BYU was prompted by a planned seven-game suspension for violating the university's honor code, which prohibits premarital sex. Retzlaff was previously involved in a lawsuit where he was accused of sexual assault, an allegation he denied; the suit was later jointly dismissed. As a non-Mormon, Retzlaff was still required to follow BYU's strict code, and his move to Tulane will allow him to play a full final season of eligibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Community bail funds, which saw a surge in popularity and donations after the 2020 protests, are now facing increased scrutiny and restrictive legislation from Republican lawmakers. These funds use donations to pay bail for individuals who cannot afford it, allowing them to await trial at home rather than in jail. Proponents argue they are a vital lifeline and an alternative to a cash bail system that disproportionately affects the poor, while critics raise public safety concerns. At least four states have passed laws restricting these funds, sparking a debate over criminal justice reform and community solidarity.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic examines the term "criminal alien," arguing it is a misleading and historically fraught label used by the Trump administration to justify harsh immigration policies. The article traces the term's origins to the 1929 Undesirable Aliens Act, which was rooted in eugenics and racial prejudice. It contends that data consistently shows immigrants are less likely to commit violent crimes than native-born citizens, and that most "criminal alien" convictions are for immigration violations, not violent offenses. The piece critiques the expansion of ICE detention centers while funding for traditional law enforcement agencies is cut.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly relying on tariffs as a primary tool for international leverage, often blurring the line between trade protection and punitive sanctions. This strategy, characterized by sudden tariff threats and reversals, creates significant uncertainty for global markets and trading partners. Unlike traditional sanctions, tariffs offer unilateral control and generate revenue, aligning with the "America First" agenda but risking global trade destabilization. The article notes this approach is being used to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking, prompting retaliatory measures and escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that the 700 U.S. Marines sent to Los Angeles a month ago will begin to withdraw from the city. The troops were deployed in early June amid large-scale federal immigration raids and protests, a move that was fiercely denounced by local officials as an inappropriate use of military force. A Pentagon spokesperson stated the withdrawal was directed as stability has returned to the city, crediting the Marines' presence with restoring order. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the withdrawal a "win for Los Angeles," reiterating that the military's presence on city streets was inappropriate.</p>

          <h2>Shark Attack Survivor Offers Key Tips for Staying Safe During an Encounter</h2>

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, shared his top survival tips amid recent shark sightings. He advises to first and foremost stay calm and avoid splashing, as panic can attract the shark. Secondly, he recommends maintaining eye contact and standing your ground, as sharks prefer an easy, unaware target. As a final resort, he suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose or gills rather than punching it. De Gelder is demonstrating these techniques in a new Discovery Channel special to help educate the public on shark safety.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight approaching Minot, North Dakota, was forced to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military bomber. The pilot informed passengers that the bomber appeared on a converging course without any prior warning from air traffic control. The incident occurred while the B-52 was reportedly conducting a low-altitude flyover for the North Dakota State Fair. The pilot successfully maneuvered the commercial jet away from the bomber, circled, and landed safely. The FAA, the Air Force, and the airline are all investigating the serious near-miss event.</p>

          <p>The England women's football team, the Lionesses, have decided to stop taking the knee before matches, stating the anti-racism gesture is no longer having a sufficient impact. The decision came after defender Jess Carter revealed she had received racist abuse online during the Euro 2025 tournament. Manager Sarina Wiegman and midfielder Georgia Stanway explained that the team felt a different approach was needed to tackle racism. Instead of kneeling, the players will stand together at kick-off to signal that current anti-racism efforts are not enough and to spark further conversation on the issue.</p>

This call for scrutiny comes as President Trump has openly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and demanded interest rate cuts, a move Bessent also appeared to support, citing moderating inflation.

The 33-year-old assemblyman's campaign, which focused on affordability and Palestinian rights, mobilized a diverse coalition of voters and grassroots organizations. His rise is seen as a sign of hope in a city where Islamophobia surged after 9/11, challenging assumptions about who can represent New York. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's success reflects a shift within the Democratic base and has made him a popular figure among Muslims nationwide.</p>

NHS England has instructed hospitals to cancel non-urgent care only in exceptional circumstances, aiming to minimize disruption. However, the BMA warns this directive will stretch non-striking doctors too thinly, compromising emergency services and putting patients at risk. This new, more aggressive approach from NHS leadership contrasts with previous strikes where non-urgent work was widely rescheduled to ensure safe staffing levels for emergency and urgent care.</p>
