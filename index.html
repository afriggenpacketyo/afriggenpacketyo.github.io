          <p>Jack Teixeira, serving a 15-year sentence for leaking classified U.S. national defense secrets, spoke out for the first time since his arrest, maintaining that he doesn't feel he betrayed his country. Teixeira said his intent was to educate the public about undisclosed information, particularly regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, believing they were being misled by the Biden administration. He claims his case was politicized and that others have received lighter sentences for similar offenses. Teixeira is currently seeking a pardon from Donald Trump, believing Trump will view him as a supporter. </p>

          <p>A High Court judge has temporarily halted talks between the UK and Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands deal following a last-minute injunction sought by two Chagossian women. The proposed agreement would transfer sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius while allowing the UK and US to continue using a military base there for 99 years. The legal action was brought by women who want to return to the islands, a move prevented by both the current and proposed arrangements. The court will hear the case again, while representatives of the Chagossian community are meeting with a Foreign Office minister to discuss the territory's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The House is set to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill, dubbed "The Big, Beautiful Bill," after unveiling an updated version aimed at appeasing various Republican factions.

Speaker Mike Johnson faces a tight margin, needing to secure almost all Republican votes as Democrats are expected to oppose the measure. Even if passed in the House, the bill is anticipated to encounter resistance in the Senate, where Republicans are likely to seek further changes. </p>

          <p>Juan Soto, the Mets' $765 million slugger, is under intense scrutiny in his first season with the team, despite solid performance. Early anxieties arose from instances of perceived lack of hustle and unfounded rumors about private travel arrangements. While his current OPS+ of 134 is above average, it falls short of his career standard, leading to heightened expectations and criticism. Experts suggest that Soto's track record and underlying statistics indicate he will soon return to his elite form, emphasizing the need for patience and perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approach to tariffs involves initially proposing high rates, only to later reduce them or offer exemptions, creating a sense of relief even when tariffs remain substantial. This strategy, known as the anchor effect, recontextualizes the numbers in a negotiation. Despite some tariffs feeling like a relief, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. is now the highest since 1934. While Trump argues that tariffs will create long-term gains, the uncertainty they cause poses problems for businesses and investment decisions. </p>

Experts say that these curbs reduce the ability of U.S. companies to access the Chinese market and accelerate domestic innovation in China.

          <p>The House voted to begin debating Republicansâ€™ sweeping domestic policy bill, facing challenges in unifying their ranks amid unified Democratic opposition. Speaker Mike Johnson sought to win over holdouts through concessions, but several Republicans still expressed dissatisfaction. The bill addresses tax cuts, military spending, and social program adjustments. Democrats criticized the measure for favoring the wealthy at the expense of social programs. The vote reflects the ongoing struggle to balance competing priorities within the Republican conference. </p>

          <p>Higher-than-expected borrowing figures for April have put pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with experts predicting likely tax increases in the autumn. Borrowing reached Â£20.2bn, up Â£1bn from April last year, marking the fourth-highest figure since 1993. Experts suggest that the government will struggle to meet its economic rules without future tax hikes. While tax receipts increased due to National Insurance contributions, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension costs. </p>

          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued as it reached a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional buyers. This surge occurs despite a recent drop in U.S. stock markets, diverging from Bitcoin's typical correlation with equities. Factors contributing to the rally include broader macro concerns, such as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which bolsters Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against fiat instability. Favorable regulatory developments and positive sentiment from key figures also support the market.</p>

The tower's base dates to the 14th century, but the building atop was constructed in 1995 and renovated last year to fix falling tiles. Questions have arisen regarding the quality of the $420,000 renovation and potential misuse of public funds. CCTV reported that the 1995 reconstruction was unauthorized, adding to concerns about the structure's integrity and oversight. </p>
