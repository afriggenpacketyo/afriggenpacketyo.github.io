        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, though profits were significantly impacted by trade tariffs. The company affirmed its full-year guidance but acknowledged a $1.1 billion reduction in operating income due to the tariffs, with its Korean operations being heavily affected. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost-saving measures. The automaker also noted that while EV sales are growing, the recent removal of government tax credits is expected to slow future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola's second-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street predictions, largely driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa division. However, the company experienced a 1% decrease in global unit case volume, with declines in North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific markets. CEO James Quincey noted that while some markets showed sequential improvement, economic uncertainty continues to affect consumer confidence. The company narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast to the top end of its previous range, projecting 3% growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laura Anne Jones, a Member of the Welsh Senedd, has defected from the Conservative Party to join Nigel Farage's Reform UK, becoming the party's first representative in the Welsh Parliament. Jones stated she could no longer support Conservative policies, a move that drew criticism from her former party, which said voters would feel "very let down." The defection follows a period where Jones faced investigations into her conduct and expenses, though she expressed confidence in the outcomes. The move highlights Reform UK's growing influence in Welsh politics ahead of the next Senedd election.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies have surged dramatically, becoming a focal point for retail traders in a revival of meme stock enthusiasm. The stock, which traded under $1 for most of the year, saw its price multiply after gaining traction on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. The rally was fueled by massive trading volumes, significant short interest leading to a potential short squeeze, and heightened options activity. This speculative trading frenzy echoes the GameStop mania of 2021, turning the struggling tech startup into a highly volatile market phenomenon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will launch a version of its namesake soda sweetened with U.S.-produced cane sugar this fall, complementing its existing high-fructose corn syrup formula. The move follows a social media post by President Donald Trump advocating for the change, which the company acknowledged. While "Mexican Coke," made with cane sugar, has long been popular in the U.S., this new product will be an official domestic offering. The decision comes despite long-standing U.S. tariffs that make cane sugar a more expensive ingredient than domestically subsidized corn syrup.</p>

Clooney had written a New York Times op-ed calling for a new nominee after observing the former president at a fundraiser. Hunter Biden dismissed Clooney's assessment, attributing his father's poor debate performance to a grueling schedule and sleep medication.

Both are considered "empty calories" and contribute to the same health risks, such as weight gain and Type 2 diabetes.

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced he will meet with Ghislaine Maxwell in the coming days to determine what she knows about Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. The move, directed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, comes after criticism of the Trump administration for not releasing more information from the Epstein investigation files. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed discussions with the government are underway, stating she will "testify truthfully" and expressing gratitude for the commitment to uncovering the truth. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in the affair.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called on technology companies to commit to powering all data centers with 100% renewable energy by 2030. The appeal comes as the rapidly growing AI industry's immense energy demands are leading some to turn to fossil fuels like gas and coal. Guterres emphasized that the future, being built in the cloud, must be powered by sustainable sources like wind and solar. His call precedes the U.S. administration's expected AI Action Plan, which may ease environmental regulations to accelerate the construction of power plants to meet the sector's energy needs.</p>

          <p>Russian lawmakers have approved legislation that introduces fines for individuals who search for or access online materials deemed "extremist" by the government. The bill is the latest step in the Kremlin's widespread crackdown on dissent, targeting a broad range of content, including materials from opposition groups and the "international LGBT movement." While it is unclear how authorities will enforce the law, observers suggest it may involve monitoring by internet providers or random checks of device search histories. The move has drawn criticism, even from some pro-Kremlin figures who argue it will hinder their own monitoring efforts.</p>

          <p>Facing significant financial losses and declining ridership, public bus companies across China are exploring unconventional business models to stay afloat. With passenger volumes less than half of pre-pandemic levels, operators are repurposing idle buses for new services. For example, the Zhengzhou Public Transport Group has partnered with a courier company to use its fleet for intracity deliveries during off-peak hours. Other innovative measures being tested include converting buses for pet transport, as companies seek creative revenue streams to compensate for the public's shift toward subways and ride-hailing services.</p>

Consumers are increasingly opting for cheaper supermarket own-brand products, seeking promotions, and preparing simpler meals to manage costs.

At a recent conference, Carlson compared the White House's dismissive attitude to the establishment liberals Trump campaigned against. This tension highlights a broader ideological split within the right-wing movement on issues beyond the Epstein scandal, including foreign policy and economic populism.</p>
