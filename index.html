          <p>Lucy Connolly received a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred after posting a tweet calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire, prompting a debate about free speech. While some view the sentence as tyrannical, others argue that Connolly's supporters are advocating for the right to be racist. Connolly's legal team argued the sentence was excessive, but the Court of Appeal disagreed, highlighting Connolly's other online posts indicating her views on illegal immigrants. The Free Speech Union has funded Connolly's appeal and expressed concerns about police overreach regarding online activity, while others maintain that online spaces can be dangerous and require police intervention.</p>

Widger, who has Klippel-Feil syndrome, said his diagnosis pushed him to pursue a life worth living, inspiring others to break out of their routines.

The annual salary will increase to over 6 million yen ($41,000), and chefs can opt for government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food. The government aims to fill vacancies at approximately a dozen out of 230 missions and hopes the new system will enable chefs to develop their careers more easily.</p>

This announcement puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced calls from Labour MPs to address both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move highlights divisions within the Labour party regarding welfare policies, with over 10 million pensioners losing out on winter fuel payments last year.</p>

          <p>North Korea's newest warship was severely damaged during a launch ceremony witnessed by Kim Jong Un, who blamed the incident on carelessness and vowed to punish those responsible. A malfunction caused the stern of the destroyer to slide prematurely into the water, crushing parts of the hull. Kim ordered the vessel to be restored by late June, though analysts doubt this is possible given the potential damage. The accident marks a setback for North Korea's naval modernization efforts, and analysts question the country's ability to scale its navy.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape," died at 90. Her book, published in 1975, redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, influencing the women's movement and leading to legal reforms. The book offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault, examining its use as a wartime tactic. While praised for its scholarship, it also drew criticism for its feminist dogma, particularly the assertion that all men threaten all women with sexual violence.</p>

This marks a shift from previous Liberal governments, with a British monarch not delivering Canada's throne speech since 1977. The invitation comes at a time when Canada faces economic challenges due to tariffs imposed by the US, and serves as a symbolic display of Canada's distinct identity.</p>

The practical test backlog also forces learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills, adding to the financial burden.
