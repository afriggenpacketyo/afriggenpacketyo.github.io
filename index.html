        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yoshihiko Noda, the head of Japan's main opposition party, has decided against submitting a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, making same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely. Noda cited concerns about creating a political vacuum amid rising tensions in the Middle East and worries over higher U.S. tariffs. Ishiba had previously stated his readiness to dissolve the lower house for a snap election if such a motion were submitted, but Noda's decision avoids this scenario. Noda's party is the only one capable of submitting such a motion on its own, but would require support from other parties for it to pass. </p>

          <p>Lithuanian hunters have declined a government request to shoot a young female bear that wandered into Vilnius, the capital city, causing a stir among residents. The government issued the kill permit as a precaution, but hunters, aware of the small bear population in Lithuania, refused to comply, advocating for sedation and relocation instead. The bear, estimated to be around 2 years old, was described as scared but not aggressive, and was later spotted peacefully wandering through a forest outside the city. This event sparked a debate about wildlife management and conservation efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has caused a spike in shipping insurance costs for vessels navigating the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for Gulf journeys, up from 0.125% before Israel's recent attack on Iran, and war risk insurance rates have also increased for the Red Sea. Insurance coverage relating to ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%, reflecting the heightened security risks in the region.

Ishiba aims to protect Japan's interests without being seen as yielding to U.S. pressure, emphasizing that any agreement must benefit both sides. Despite multiple rounds of negotiations, a deal has not been reached, primarily due to disagreements over the auto tariff. Failure to secure a deal could have economic repercussions, especially for smaller suppliers, while making concessions could hurt voter support ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>Japan is returning to long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) deals due to the growing demand from data centers supporting the artificial intelligence boom and rising costs of alternative energy sources. The country's new national energy plan also identifies gas as a key transition fuel for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This shift marks a change from previous years when Japan's LNG imports were declining due to nuclear power plant restarts and increased renewable energy use. The new energy plan encourages public-private cooperation to secure long-term LNG contracts, recognizing the importance of stable supply amidst price volatility and potential disruptions.

          <h2>Japan's Free High School Policy May Lead to Public School Exodus</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new policy of making high school tuition virtually free, even at private institutions, is raising concerns among educators and policy experts about a potential exodus from public schools. While intended to ease financial burdens on households, the policy may undermine the role of public schools as safety nets for students with diverse needs. Critics argue that the government has not provided adequate support to struggling public schools, many of which face declining enrollment and budget shortfalls. The policy, rushed through as part of a political deal, may exacerbate inequalities within the education system.</p>

          <p>During a visit by the Juventus football squad to the White House, former President Donald Trump engaged the players and staff in an awkward discussion about transgender women in sports. Trump, who previously signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports, questioned the team about their views on the subject. When asked if a woman could make the team, Juventus's general manager attempted to deflect the question, leading Trump to comment on his diplomacy. The incident occurred amid increasing hostility towards transgender people in the U.S., coinciding with a Supreme Court ruling upholding a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during preparations for an engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, resulting in a significant setback for the Super Heavy-Starship program. The explosion occurred as the Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and methane fuel, destroying the rocket and potentially damaging infrastructure at the test site. SpaceX confirmed the incident, stating that all personnel are safe and that they are working to secure the area. The explosion will likely delay the next test flight of the Starship, which is critical to NASA's plans for lunar landings.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully created a compact device capable of generating controlled nuclear reactions between hydrogen and lithium, marking a significant advancement in neutron generation technology. This portable neutron gun utilizes an electromagnetic technique to collide hydrogen protons with lithium atoms, producing a high-energy neutron beam. The device has potential applications in scientific research, industrial processes, and defense, offering a powerful yet compact source of neutrons. Each neutron packs 3 million electron volts of energy, similar to particles emitted during an atomic bomb explosion.</p>

Activists point out that those arrested were working individuals, not criminals, and are advocating for their rights and release. The raids are part of a broader trend of increased immigration enforcement, with some drawing comparisons to past administrations and criticizing the current approach as violating human rights.</p>

Pitcher said the family "didn't know anything" about her uncle's friendship with Turing, and had "no idea at all" how much the papers would be worth when they took them for valuation.

New Zealand's Foreign Minister stated that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship, which has been undermined by the deals. The Cook Islands has responded by saying it is determined to address the issue urgently, adding that it "highly values" New Zealand's development assistance over the years.</p>
