          <p>Anthony Coulson, a general manager at McVitie's, suggests that chocolate digestives are best enjoyed with the chocolate side facing down, allowing the chocolate to melt and enhance the flavor. This counters the popular method of eating it chocolate-side up. McVitie's has been producing these biscuits for a century, with approximately 80 million packets made annually, all with chocolate made in Greater Manchester. While Coulson acknowledges personal preference, he posits the chocolate-down method provides a better sensory experience. </p>

          <p>President Zelensky's firm stance against recognizing Russian control over Crimea is deeply rooted in Ukraine's domestic political landscape. Formal recognition would be seen as a betrayal of Ukrainians in Crimea and a dangerous concession to Russia. No Ukrainian politician would risk political suicide by voting to legalize the occupation, highlighting the significance of Crimea to Ukrainian national identity and territorial integrity. This stance is further solidified by the hopes of reuniting families separated since the 2014 occupation. </p>

While the revised outlook doesn't account for potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., it does include a charge related to the Hengrui Pharma agreement.

          <p>China has refuted claims by the Trump administration that active negotiations are underway regarding tariffs, asserting that the U.S. should first revoke its unilateral tariffs. This denial comes despite signals from U.S. officials suggesting a potential trade pact, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicating an "opportunity for a big deal." China maintains that any discussions must be based on mutual respect and equality, and insists on the cancellation of all tariffs currently imposed on Chinese goods.</p>
