          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves asserted that the UK has secured the best trade deals with the US, EU, and India, positioning Britain as a prime location for investment and business. Reeves highlighted recent agreements, including a deal with the EU that she described as the best for any country outside the bloc, and hinted at upgraded economic growth forecasts due to these deals. However, opposition parties have criticized the government for concessions made in these trade agreements, while Reeves mentioned a future deal with Gulf nations, signaling continued trade expansion efforts.

          <p>The US Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially subjecting them to deportation. This decision overturns a lower court's block on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's move to end TPS, which had allowed Venezuelans to live and work legally in the US due to unsafe conditions in their home country. Activists and attorneys for the migrants have strongly criticized the ruling, citing the impossible choices it presents for families, while Homeland Security framed the decision as a victory for American safety, reflecting the ongoing contentious debate over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in New Orleans after ten inmates, some charged with violent crimes, escaped from the Orleans Parish jail, highlighting long-standing issues of poor conditions and insufficient oversight. The escape, marked by a taunting message left behind, has prompted scrutiny of the jail's security, including non-functional cameras and defective locks. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has demanded answers, emphasizing the need to address failings in the criminal justice system, while investigators suggest the inmates may be receiving outside assistance. The jail has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 due to problems such as overcrowding and understaffing, raising questions about the facility's management and security protocols.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian resident of Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, has been arrested in Japan after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture, causing a collision with multiple vehicles.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, surged over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's potential to capitalize on the electric vehicle (EV) boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the funds to construct a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients.

Injuries to key starters have forced the team to rely on depth arms, contributing to longer innings and increased workloads for the staff.

The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment removing parental responsibility from convicted sexual abusers, but only if they abused their own children, a limitation the family finds disappointing. The original case involved a mother who spent over Â£30,000 to remove her ex-husband's parental rights after his conviction for serious child sex offenses.

          <p>The United States has initiated its first government-funded voluntary deportation flight, sending 68 migrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their home countries. The migrants received $1,000 debit cards and the offer to one day apply for legal entry into the U.S. In return, the Trump administration has promised to increase deportations substantially, but some experts believe the self-deportation offer will only appeal to a small portion of migrants already considering return. Some of the migrants cited increasing difficulties and hostility in the U.S. as reasons for their return, although deportation numbers remain below last year's pace.</p>
