          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, former President Trump addressed the possibility of regime change in Iran on social media. He questioned why a regime unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN" would not be replaced, echoing his campaign rhetoric. The strikes, which Trump deemed a "spectacular military success," targeted key Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. The article highlights Trump's evolving views on military intervention, contrasting his campaign promise of "no more wars" with recent actions. Optimism regarding the situation remains low as the potential for further escalation looms large.</p>

The statement was made during an emergency UN Security Council meeting. While other council members expressed concern, divisions emerged along geopolitical lines, with China and Russia defending Iran and the U.S. and its allies defending Israel.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is under renewed scrutiny as Japan faces the potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. tensions rising, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. Japan currently houses six pandas, all born domestically but owned by China, with their loan periods expiring soon. Experts believe China may offer new panda loans to Japan as a gesture of goodwill amid complex geopolitical dynamics and trade disputes. The article suggests that panda diplomacy, while symbolic, may not have the same diplomatic impact as in the past.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil trade route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. In 2024 and early 2025, it facilitated over a quarter of global maritime oil trade. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that an Iranian effort to block the strait "would be a suicidal move," likely drawing backlash from many powerful countries. The U.S. has long pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>

          <p>Six teenagers, ranging in age from 14 to 18, were shot at a party in Moreno Valley, California, with five suffering life-threatening injuries. Riverside County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a report of gunshots and found one victim with multiple gunshot wounds, later discovering four additional victims at the scene. A sixth teenager arrived at the hospital separately with gunshot wounds, also linked to the incident. Sheriff’s deputies were unable to identify a suspect at the crime scene, and the shooting's circumstances remain under investigation.</p>

The prime minister has spoken to President Trump in the aftermath of the attacks, but the situation remains tense.</p>

          <p>The Iranian community in Los Angeles, the largest outside Iran, is grappling with mixed emotions following the U.S. military attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Many Iranian Americans express anger and hate towards the Iranian regime but worry about the potential consequences for civilians in Iran. Some express concerns about a wider war and the potential loss of Israeli lives. The community's reaction is muted, with some stores and restaurants having more journalists than Iranian patrons. The community is trying to balance their dislike for the government with concern for family members left behind.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called for China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for crude oil. China is Iran's most important oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the Islamic Republic. An attempt to block the waterway could have profound consequences for the global economy. In 2024, some 20 million barrels per day of crude oil, or 20% of global consumption, flowed through the strait. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This shift is attributed to government subsidies, long-term planning, and dominance in battery production. China's BYD now leads the global EV market, surpassing Tesla. The government provided vast subsidies to grow the industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EVs. This combination of planning and funding has allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production, but other countries see it as unfair business practice.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a clinic by year-end offering ketamine for severe depression, providing an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The clinic director admits the cost of ketamine-assisted therapy may be out of reach for many and hopes it will soon be available on the NHS. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>
