          <p>The United States and China have reported making substantial progress in recent trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war between the two economic giants. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the talks were "in-depth" and "candid." These meetings, the first since significant tariff hikes were imposed earlier in the year, have raised hopes for a reduction in trade barriers and a stabilization of the global economy. Full details from the talks are expected to be released soon, with speculation of potential tariff cuts, though some experts remain cautious about the extent of the agreement.</p>

This "most favored nation's policy" aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, but faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it will stifle innovation.

The plane, a 747-8, will require security checks and modifications before being accepted and is intended for donation to the future Trump presidential library. Qatar's Media Attaché confirmed discussions about a possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One, but denied reports of an immediate gift. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has called for an investigation into the potential acceptance of the plane as a gift, citing concerns about ethics and federal regulations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is defending the potential acceptance of a luxury plane from Qatar’s royal family as a "transparent" deal, despite criticism and accusations of bribery and corruption. Qatar acknowledged discussions about a possible transfer of a plane for temporary use as Air Force One, but denied a final decision or that it was a gift. Trump confirmed the plan on his Truth Social platform, stating the Defense Department is receiving a "free of charge gift" to replace the aging Air Force One. The proposal has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue it raises ethical concerns and constitutes foreign influence.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, renowned for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, is facing serious strain from a shrinking workforce and an aging population. The system, which ensures medical care remains accessible through mechanisms like capped out-of-pocket costs, is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that politicizing the health insurance system could undermine its stability and erode public trust in government. Prime Minister Ishiba's government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing steps, with a portion expected from medical system savings, leading to debates over increasing the burden on patients with high medical costs.</p>

The proposal is a "most favored nation" pricing model, where the United States would pay the lowest price among its peer countries. The plan will likely face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it would cut into profits and reduce research spending.

While high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle, some experts believe the convenience and positive perception of protein have led to manufacturers using it as a marketing tool. Nutritionists caution that many of these products are ultra-processed and may not be as healthy as advertised, while excess protein consumption can lead to weight gain.</p>
