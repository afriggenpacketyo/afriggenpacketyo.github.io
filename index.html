          <p>Human microbiome scientist Wang Leyao has left her position in the United States to join the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (Smart) in China. Formerly an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a member of an NIH cohort, Wang's move comes as U.S. medical research agencies face significant challenges. The article notes that agencies have been embroiled in controversy and faced funding cuts and policy shifts during the second Trump administration. This has reportedly left thousands of American researchers in a state of uncertainty regarding their work and funding.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from expanding its "expedited removal" policy across the entire country. The ruling cites significant concerns that the policy, which allows for rapid deportations without a full judicial hearing, violates the due process rights of migrants. Previously limited to areas near the border for recent arrivals, the expansion would have applied to individuals anywhere in the U.S. who could not prove they had been in the country for more than two years. This decision represents a major legal setback for the administration's broader immigration enforcement agenda, although it is expected to be appealed.</p>

          <p>Despite struggling with a lower back injury that required a medical timeout, Novak Djokovic defeated Britain's Cameron Norrie to advance to the fourth round of the US Open. The 24-time Grand Slam champion won the match in four sets, ending British singles interest in the tournament. Norrie, who has now lost all seven of his matches against Djokovic, briefly gained an advantage in the third set but was unable to maintain his momentum. Djokovic, who is aiming for a record 25th major title, acknowledged the physical challenge but ultimately showcased his resilience and superior play to secure the victory.</p>

          <p>South Korean authorities have indicted former first lady Kim Keon Hee on charges of bribery and stock market manipulation, alleging she amassed over $720,000 in criminal proceeds. The charges include a stock manipulation scheme from 2010-2012 and accepting bribes in exchange for political support. Kim is the wife of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached and arrested earlier this year over his attempt to declare martial law. The investigation is part of a broader probe into Yoon's administration, which he had previously vetoed while in office, creating significant political turmoil in the country.</p>

          <p>Russian forces have launched what Ukrainian officials are calling a "massive attack" on the central Dnipropetrovsk region. Regional Governor Sergiy Lysak reported explosions in the cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd, urging residents to take shelter. This assault marks a significant escalation in a region that has, until recently, largely avoided the heaviest fighting of the war. The attack comes as Kyiv confirmed that Russian troops had entered the region earlier in the week, signaling a potential new focus for Moscow's offensive operations.

          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly criticized the planned deployment of the U.S.-made Typhon missile system in Japan during joint military exercises next month. Beijing stated that it firmly opposes the deployment in Asian countries, arguing it undermines the security interests of other nations in the region. Analysts view the move as a strategic signal from the U.S. and Japan directed at China, particularly concerning potential conflicts over Taiwan. The Typhon system is scheduled to be deployed at a U.S. base in Yamaguchi prefecture for the duration of the exercises before being withdrawn.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated a Justice Department paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making a vulgar gesture at National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. According to reports, Baxter raised her middle finger and uttered obscenities at the troops while on her way to work. The dismissal reflects the administration's firm stance on supporting law enforcement, with a spokesperson stating the DOJ may not be a good fit for those who don't. The incident occurs amid heightened tensions following President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to the capital to address what he declared a crime emergency.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying across the United States, with California and Missouri taking steps to counteract a new Texas law designed to favor Republicans. After Texas Republicans redrew maps to create five new GOP-leaning districts, California lawmakers voted to redraw their own state's maps to add five Democratic seats. Following this, Missouri's governor has called a special session to create one more Republican seat. This escalating arms race over gerrymandering is driven by President Trump's call for Republican-led states to secure control of the U.S. House ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems.

Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about any such plan and argued that the president has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction. The comments come after President Trump deployed federal agents and National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and suggested Chicago could be next. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker for deflecting from what it described as a severe crime crisis in the city.</p>

          <p>Campaigns are set to spend millions of dollars on television ads for California's upcoming special election on Proposition 50, a measure that would redraw congressional district maps. The opposition has already booked over $10 million in airtime, while supporters have purchased at least $2 million, with more expected. This rare mid-decade redistricting effort was initiated by Democrats to counter a similar Republican-led move in Texas, turning California into a key battleground for control of the U.S. House. The high-stakes fight pits Governor Gavin Newsom against a coalition including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced the cancellation of $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that had been previously approved by Congress. President Trump utilized a rarely used procedural move known as a "pocket rescission" to withhold the funds for 15 international programs near the end of the fiscal year. The move bypasses the typical congressional approval process for spending changes. Both Democratic and some Republican lawmakers have criticized the decision, with some calling it an illegal violation of Congress's power of the purse and warning it could increase the likelihood of a future government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A charity program is helping teenagers with anxiety and poor school attendance by pairing them as mentors with toddlers from a local nursery. The initiative, run by the charity Power2, aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the older students. Participants have reported significant improvements, with one teenager's school attendance more than doubling. The program operates on the principle that giving a disengaged teen responsibility for a younger child can positively impact their own engagement with learning. It addresses the growing issue of school avoidance, which has nearly doubled since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A new investigation has concluded that Buford Pusser, the legendary Tennessee sheriff who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," killed his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged it to look like an ambush by his enemies. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation reexamined the cold case and found inconsistencies between Pusser's account and the physical evidence. An exhumation and new autopsy revealed Pauline was likely shot outside their car, and Pusser's own wound was likely self-inflicted. Authorities stated that if Pusser, who died in a car crash in 1974, were alive today, he would be indicted for murder.</p>

In states like Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico, CVS cannot administer the vaccine even with a prescription.

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine indicates that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too soon, contrary to clinical guidelines. The research, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that 42% of children aged 3 to 5 were prescribed drugs within 30 days of their diagnosis. Experts recommend behavioral intervention as the first line of treatment for this age group, as stimulant medications can have side effects like irritability and emotional problems. The study highlights a need for further investigation into why early medication is being chosen over other recommended strategies.</p>

The move follows frustrations from veterans over a slow and difficult process to return to service after the Biden-era mandate was rescinded in 2023. Since President Trump signed an executive order to reinstate them, only a small fraction of the hundreds who have applied have been brought back.</p>

Appearing on Fox News, Johnson deflected by calling Newsom an attention-seeker before acknowledging that his own hometown has only seen gradual crime reduction.

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts in a bid to gain a partisan advantage for the GOP. The proposed new map specifically targets the Kansas City-area district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. This makes Missouri the third state, after Texas and California, to engage in an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle. The move aligns with President Trump's call for Republican-led states to reshape district lines to help the party maintain its majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the upcoming elections.</p>
