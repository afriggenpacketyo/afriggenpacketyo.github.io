          <p>Tommy Fleetwood secured his maiden PGA Tour title at the Tour Championship, ending a significant wait of 164 starts with a decisive three-shot victory at 18 under par. The Englishman's triumph, which also earned him the FedEx Cup, was met with an outpouring of emotion and chants from an adoring crowd, including praise from fellow European Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose. This heartwarming win not only highlights Fleetwood's exceptional mental strength and persistence but also provides a substantial confidence boost for European golf ahead of the crucial Ryder Cup next month. Fleetwood expressed profound gratitude for the immense support and voiced his aspiration that this hard-fought victory marks the first of many to come in his distinguished career.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been abruptly removed as Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, with Christine Bordine, the agency's deputy director, stepping into the acting role. This high-profile ousting follows a DIA preliminary assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which reportedly contradicted President Trump's public statements about the extent of the damage. Democratic Senator Mark Warner sharply criticized the move, characterizing it as indicative of the Trump administration's "dangerous habit" of prioritizing loyalty over the integrity of national security intelligence. The article notes that several other senior military officials have also been recently removed from their positions, fueling broader concerns about the politicization of intelligence within the defense establishment.</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner after he published an open letter in the Wall Street Journal, accusing the French government of insufficient action against rising antisemitic violence. Kushner's letter controversially linked the surge in antisemitism to France's statements about recognizing a Palestinian state, a claim the French foreign ministry "firmly refutes" as unacceptable interference in its internal affairs, citing the Vienna Convention. This diplomatic spat highlights deep ideological and political divides between France, the United States, and Israel, particularly concerning the ongoing conflict in Gaza and its ripple effects on hate crimes. France, home to significant Jewish and Muslim communities, has seen a reported spike in such incidents since October 7, 2023.</p>

The 25-year-old BMW driver sustained major injuries but survived, while a 22-year-old passenger in the Sentra remains in critical condition. Authorities are actively investigating the incident, with potential charges pending against the BMW driver, though alcohol has been ruled out as a factor in this tragic event.</p>

          <p>Da Wei, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, has critically assessed US policy toward China, characterizing it as marred by "ignorance and neglect" in the ongoing geopolitical competition. In a recent interview, he provided insights into the current high-level trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, which have seen a 90-day extension of the tariff truce. Da Wei expressed cautious optimism that an agreement over tariffs could be reached, ideally by autumn, believing that both nations are keen to finalize a deal. His analysis, rooted in extensive research on China-US relations and US security policy, offers a nuanced perspective on the complex diplomatic and economic challenges facing the two global powers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric against Baltimore, threatening to deploy the National Guard to the city to "clean up" crime, following a "nasty" and "provocative" invitation from Maryland Governor Wes Moore for a "safety walk." This move is part of Trump's broader strategy to use federalized military personnel for domestic law enforcement in Democratic-led cities, a policy that has drawn fierce criticism from Democrats. Governor Moore condemned Trump's comments as "tone deaf and ignorant," asserting that crime figures in Washington D.C., where troops are already deployed, show significant decreases. The proposed deployment highlights an ongoing national debate over federal intervention in local governance and public safety strategies.</p>

Carter-Walters, co-founder of "Chicago Flips Red," publicly supports the crackdown, believing it will effectively deter crime.

          <p>Jerry Adler, a revered figure who spent decades as a stage manager, producer, and director on Broadway before transitioning to a successful acting career in his 60s, has passed away peacefully at the age of 96. Adler was widely recognized for his memorable roles as Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." His unexpected pivot to acting, which he humorously described as saving him from a "mediocre career," led to over 30 years of consistent work across film and television. Adler, who published a memoir last year, firmly believed in staying active, famously stating, "I think retirement is a road to nowhere."</p>

          <p>Joe Root's magnificent unbeaten 64 guided Trent Rockets to a thrilling three-wicket victory over Welsh Fire, securing their place in the knockout stages of The Hundred men's competition. Chasing a target of 151, the Rockets experienced a late-game collapse, losing five wickets for just 20 runs, but Root's calm demeanor and crucial hitting, including a six and a four, stabilized the innings. Sam Hain ultimately struck the winning runs with a single ball to spare, confirming the top three teams and eliminating others from contention. The article also notes a controversial no-ball decision early in Root's innings, which could have significantly altered the game's outcome.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces reportedly killed four aid seekers near Gaza City, adding to the tragic toll of Palestinians dying while desperately trying to access food in a region facing a declared famine. UNICEF and Senator Jeanne Shaheen vehemently condemned the escalating humanitarian crisis, with Shaheen directly attributing aid obstruction to Prime Minister Netanyahu. Witnesses described indiscriminate gunfire on a crowd heading to a food distribution point, hundreds of meters from the site. This incident occurs amidst intensified Israeli military operations in northern Gaza, with the Hamas-run Health Ministry reporting a rising number of malnutrition-related deaths, including children, and a disproportionately high civilian casualty ratio, exacerbating an already dire situation.</p>

          <h2>California Cannabis Tax Cut Sparks Child Care Funding Debate</h2>

          <p>A proposed cannabis excise tax cut in California is generating a significant conflict, pitting the struggling legal weed industry against child-care advocates who fear a loss of $81 million annually for subsidized child-care slots. The cannabis industry, facing declining sales and intense competition from the illicit market, argues that the current 19% tax rate is unsustainable and advocates for a return to 15%. Governor Gavin Newsom's office has pledged to prevent any cuts to child care if the bill passes, though the source of replacement funds remains uncertain amidst the state's challenging financial landscape. This situation highlights the inherent instability of relying on "sin taxes" to fund crucial social services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Critics are warning that Donald Trump will be an inescapable and central figure at the 2026 World Cup, citing his frequent meetings with FIFA president Gianni Infantino and the announcement that the World Cup draw will be held at the Trump-controlled Kennedy Center. Trump's recent Oval Office appearance, where he displayed a "TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING" hat and held the World Cup trophy, underscored his intent to dominate the event. The article criticizes Infantino for appearing to endorse Trump's domestic policies, including the National Guard deployment in Washington D.C., and suggests that Trump will leverage the tournament to advance his political agenda, potentially impacting other host cities.

          <p>The Football Association has launched an investigation into a controversial banner displayed by Crystal Palace fans, which depicted Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis holding a gun to midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White's head. Nottingham Forest officials are "hugely disappointed" that the inflammatory banner, which also contained text alluding to unproven allegations against Marinakis, was permitted inside Selhurst Park. Marinakis has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to such claims. This incident further heightens tensions between the two clubs, following a contentious summer where Palace was relegated from the Europa League, with Forest taking their place, due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules.

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to reduce unacceptable delays and decrease its reliance on hotel accommodation for asylum seekers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to expedite the appeal process, which currently averages over a year. However, the Refugee Council argues that the most effective way to clear the appeals backlog is by improving the accuracy of initial decisions, noting that nearly half of original rulings are overturned. This initiative comes amidst rising public frustration and widespread protests across the UK over asylum hotel usage, with recent demonstrations leading to multiple arrests.</p>

He emphasized the importance of effective, on-the-ground strategies to address crime, highlighting Baltimore's 22% decrease in homicides for 2025. Moore's comments underscore a deep political and constitutional divide over federal intervention in local law enforcement matters, asserting state autonomy in public safety decisions.</p>
