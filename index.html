          <p>Former President Barack Obama expressed his support for Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a quorum for a vote on a Republican-backed redistricting bill. In a Zoom meeting, Obama called their actions inspiring and part of a larger effort to protect fair elections against what he termed an egregious gerrymander. The move by the Texas Democrats is a response to a plan that could give Republicans five additional congressional seats, leading to a political and legal standoff with Texas GOP leaders.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after the Hamas attack, Israel is experiencing profound internal divisions over the ongoing war in Gaza, challenging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's calls for unity. The conflict has created chasms between secular and religious Israelis, as well as between those who prioritize the return of hostages and those who support the government's goal of total victory. This article explores the contrasting perspectives within Israeli society, from protests against Palestinian civilian casualties to the messianic fervor of the religious right, highlighting a deeply fragmented social fabric.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, their objectives appear to be markedly different. Putin seeks to reassert Russia's position on the global stage, using the meeting as a symbol that Western efforts to isolate him have failed, while also aiming to solidify territorial gains in Ukraine. Conversely, Trump is driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker and to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the war, though his vacillating statements have created uncertainty about his specific strategy.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to counter a Republican redistricting effort in Texas by redrawing his state's own congressional maps to favor Democrats. The proposal, which would require voter approval in a special election, aims to "neutralize" the potential five-seat gain for Republicans in Texas, a move Newsom frames as a necessary defense of democracy against partisan gerrymandering. The announcement was marked by the unexpected presence of federal Border Patrol agents, which Newsom and other Democrats decried as an intimidation tactic orchestrated by the Trump administration.</p>

Williams, a two-time U.S. Open champion, received a wild card invitation to participate in her 25th singles championship at the event. Her participation highlights the longevity seen in professional tennis, where athletes often compete at elite levels well into their 30s and 40s, challenging conventional notions of athletic peaks.</p>

This looming insolvency could result in a significant cut to benefits for future retirees unless policymakers intervene, a situation that has eroded public confidence despite the program's vital role in American retirement security.

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has experienced a more than 1,700% surge since its 2020 public debut, reaching a market valuation exceeding $430 billion. This astronomical growth has been largely fueled by lucrative U.S. government and military contracts, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite having a fraction of the revenue of tech giants like Apple or Microsoft, its stock trades at a significantly higher forward price-to-earnings ratio, indicating immense investor confidence in its future AI-driven potential.

          <p>Wholesale retailer Costco has stated that it will not sell the abortion pill mifepristone at its pharmacy locations. The company attributed its decision to a "lack of demand from our members and other patients," noting that the medication is typically dispensed directly by medical providers. The move was praised by the Alliance Defending Freedom, an anti-abortion advocacy group that had campaigned for Costco and other retailers to refrain from becoming what it termed "abortion dispensaries."</p>

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency, the virus continues to spread rapidly across Africa, with outbreaks now reported in 24 countries. A new, more transmissible strain has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is spreading to neighboring nations, but the global response has been criticized as dangerously inadequate. Experts warn that underfunding, limited surveillance, and a failure to deliver pledged vaccines are allowing the virus to become entrenched, posing a long-term threat.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, dropped nearly 16% after it announced that tariffs would significantly impact its profits in the coming fiscal year. The company projected that higher duties, exacerbated by the suspension of the "de minimis" rule for small-value imports, will cost it $160 million and lead to earnings below analyst expectations. Despite strong current sales trends, the forecast reflects the growing financial pressure that U.S. tariffs are placing on consumer brands that rely on international manufacturing.
