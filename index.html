          <p>A significant number of car buyers are facing negative equity, owing more on their auto loans than their vehicles are worth, a trend reaching a four-year high in Q2 2025. This situation, where the average amount owed is over $6,700, complicates new car purchases by requiring drivers to either pay the balance or roll it into a new loan. Experts suggest longer loan terms and smaller down payments contribute to this issue, which becomes problematic during trade-ins or if a vehicle is totaled. Consumers are advised to research credit scores, seek pre-approvals, and consider gap insurance to mitigate risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands protested in Ankara against the Turkish government's crackdown on the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) ahead of a critical court ruling. CHP leader Ozgur Ozel denounced the upcoming hearing, which could oust him from leadership, as a "judicial coup" by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's administration. Protesters chanted for Erdogan's resignation, accusing the government of suppressing democracy and targeting political rivals. The case, alleging vote-rigging in a 2023 CHP congress, is seen by critics as a politically motivated attempt to undermine the rising opposition party.</p>

          <p>Australian researchers have achieved a significant breakthrough with the approval of a single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a major cause of death and infertility for the marsupials. Developed over a decade, the vaccine reduces infection, prevents disease progression, and can even reverse existing symptoms. Chlamydia can cause blindness and starvation in koalas, and while antibiotics exist, they are not always effective and can have adverse side effects. This innovative vaccine offers hope for reducing the devastating spread of the disease and aiding koala conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Fitness experts are highlighting the benefits of "Zone Zero," a low-intensity activity level where heart rate stays below 50% of maximum, encompassing gentle movements like walking or stretching. While not an official medical category, this concept encourages everyday activity, supporting recovery, regulating blood sugar, and improving circulation without stress. It serves as a foundation for fitness, complementing more vigorous workouts, and is easily accessible without special equipment. This approach helps people stay active, especially those not ready for traditional exercise, by focusing on consistent, light movement throughout the day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With two weeks left in the regular season, the Dodgers are in a crucial battle for playoff positioning, specifically aiming for a bye into the division series. Currently trailing the Phillies for the second-best record, securing a bye is seen as advantageous by the team's president of baseball operations, Andrew Friedman, despite past division series losses. A bye offers rest for injured players and allows for optimal pitching rotation, avoiding the risks of the wild-card round. The upcoming series against the Philadelphia Phillies is therefore vital for their postseason aspirations.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has refused an interview request from the Metropolitan Police ahead of his release for a separate offense. Brückner, currently serving a sentence in Germany for the sexual assault of an elderly woman, denies involvement in McCann's case and has never been charged. The Met Police confirmed the suspect's refusal but stated they would continue pursuing all viable lines of inquiry in the high-profile, unsolved missing person investigation.

          <h2>Expert Argues China Needs Indigenous Knowledge for AI Development</h2>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to develop its own knowledge system, particularly in the social sciences, to avoid "intellectual colonialism" in the AI era. He argues that Western social science theories, based on Western practices, fail to adequately explain non-Western civilizations like Confucianism. Zheng emphasizes that the meaning of society and technology is shaped by humanities and social sciences, and China must fully embrace its secular civilization to play a proper role in the international order. This approach is deemed crucial for building a better and more relevant AI framework.</p>

          <p>Two men have been arrested in Salt Lake City, Utah, on suspicion of placing an incendiary device under a news media vehicle. The bomb, which was lit but failed to detonate, prompted a response from police and fire bomb squads. Following an FBI investigation and a search warrant, explosives, firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction were discovered at a home in Magna. The suspects, aged 58 and 31, could face charges related to weapons possession and threats of terrorism, though a motive and their relationship remain unknown.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK ambassador to the United States, citing his links to Epstein. Business Secretary Peter Kyle admitted such an appointment would be "highly unlikely" if the full extent of Mandelson's relationship with Epstein had been known. Mandelson was recently sacked after emails revealed supportive messages to Epstein during his 2008 sexual assault charges. Giuffre's family emphasized that accountability is still needed, highlighting concerns about others connected to Epstein who may still hold positions of power.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a tragic surge in maternal and infant deaths in Afghanistan, directly linked to the closure of over 400 medical facilities after the Trump administration abruptly cut US aid. Personal accounts, like Abdul's story of losing his wife and baby due to a closed clinic, underscore the devastating human cost. The US justified the cuts citing concerns about aid benefiting the Taliban, who deny the allegations. With funding slashed and a ban on female higher education, the healthcare system is overwhelmed, leading to a projected 50% increase in maternal mortality this year, severely impacting women's access to life-saving care.</p>

          <p>"Buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans, offering interest-free installment payments, are increasingly popular with consumers, with an estimated 91.5 million Americans expected to use them in 2025. This trend poses a direct challenge to the credit card industry, as BNPL services divert potential transaction activity and revenue from traditional lenders. Banks and financial institutions are also cautious due to BNPL's "giant black hole" in consumer credit profiles, making it difficult to assess overall credit quality. The rapid adoption of these alternative credit options is reshaping the financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Utah's recently passed bill allowing open carry of firearms on college campuses is under intense scrutiny following the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. While the suspect's legal right to possess the hunting rifle is unclear, the law's timing and implications for campus safety are being questioned. Critics highlight Utah's permissive gun laws, including the absence of red-flag laws and permitless carry, contrasting with efforts to harden K-12 schools. Experts argue that while open carry might deter some crimes, it is inadequate against politically motivated violence, emphasizing the need for robust screening in public spaces.</p>
