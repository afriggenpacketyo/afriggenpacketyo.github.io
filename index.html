The argument centers on Nvidia's end-to-end AI platform, which provides essential technology for training self-driving models and powering in-vehicle computers. Unlike many competitors still in the development phase, Nvidia is already profiting from this sector, as nearly every automaker developing autonomous technology reportedly uses its systems, giving it a significant market lead.

Ofgem is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals, which could offer more payment certainty and potentially save some households up to Â£200 annually. (not investment advice)</p>
