          <p>Federal authorities have charged dozens of individuals, including Miami Heat player Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, in a widespread illegal sports betting and organized crime investigation. The nationwide probe uncovered two related schemes: one involving players allegedly faking injuries for prop bets, and another concerning high-stakes poker games rigged by organized crime families. Prosecutors detailed the use of sophisticated cheating technologies and money laundering techniques, with alleged losses in the hundreds of millions. The ongoing investigation spans 11 states and involves charges of wire fraud, extortion, and illegal gambling.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Spain have identified the body of a man who was swept away during the catastrophic floods in the Valencia region one year ago. The discovery, confirmed by DNA analysis, brings a somber conclusion to one of the three missing person cases from the disaster, which claimed over 230 lives. The victim's body was found 19 miles from where he disappeared, highlighting the flood's destructive power. The event has prompted ongoing public scrutiny of the government's emergency response and alert systems, with a state funeral planned to mark the anniversary.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest level in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability and stimulated buyer activity. Despite the rise in sales and a slight increase in inventory, the market remains tight, with the median home price climbing 2.1% year-over-year to $415,200. Persistently high prices continue to pose a challenge for many potential buyers, particularly at the lower end of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, has proposed a plan to overhaul the city's 911 response system by empowering dispatchers to determine if a police presence is necessary, potentially sending social workers instead. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from former NYPD personnel, who labeled it a "reckless and dangerous" idea that could increase liability and endanger civilians. Critics argue that assessing the volatility of situations involving emotionally disturbed individuals over the phone is impossible. Mamdani's past calls to "defund the police" are also being highlighted by opponents who question his current stance on law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Amid a growing controversy surrounding the UK's grooming gangs inquiry, a group of five abuse survivors has written to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, stating they will only continue to cooperate if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips remains in her role. This declaration of support comes after four other members of the inquiry's survivor panel resigned and demanded Phillips's removal. The division among survivors centers on Phillips's leadership and a dispute over whether the inquiry's scope should be expanded beyond grooming gangs. The five survivors praised Phillips's commitment and impartiality, creating a clear rift within the panel advising the government.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are monitoring a severe marine heatwave, known as a "blob," in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, with August temperatures recorded at 2.5°C above preindustrial levels. This significant ocean warming could lead to more thunderstorms and increased flooding in the U.S. Pacific Northwest in the coming months. The phenomenon, which has become more frequent and intense over the past decade, also poses a threat to marine ecosystems by causing harmful algal blooms and forcing species to migrate. While its direct impact on weather further inland is debated, experts agree that such events are a clear signal of a changing climate.</p>

          <p>During a public inquiry into the Southport attack, a teacher from the killer's former school described having a "visceral sense of dread" about his potential for violence. Joanne Hodson testified that Axel Rudakubana, who killed three children in a dance class, exhibited disturbing behavior and had openly admitted he brought a knife to his previous school "to use it." Hodson expressed frustration that her pleas for help were ignored by other agencies, who she felt "peeled away," leaving the school to manage the risk alone.

          <p>A Texas-based oil executive and Republican donor, Steve Nicandros, has been privately lobbying U.S. lawmakers to oppose legislation aimed at pressuring Georgia's anti-Western ruling party, Georgian Dream. In a letter to members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Nicandros argued that the measures could harm U.S. business interests and push Georgia further into Russia's influence. The lobbying effort has angered some Republicans, like Representative Joe Wilson, who sponsored a bill to punish the increasingly authoritarian government in Tbilisi.

          <p>The U.S. federal government officially entered a shutdown after President Trump and congressional Republicans could not resolve a funding impasse with Democrats. The primary point of contention is the Republican refusal to permanently extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats have demanded. A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding, forcing non-essential federal agencies to cease operations and furlough employees. This marks the latest in a series of funding battles over the past decade, with the previous shutdown in 2018 causing an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses.</p>

          <p>The gross national debt of the United States has surpassed the $38 trillion mark for the first time, a milestone reached during an ongoing government shutdown that is disrupting the economy. Fiscal policy experts note that shutdowns exacerbate the debt by delaying economic activity and increasing costs associated with pausing and restarting federal programs. The rapid accumulation of debt, which grew by a trillion dollars in just two months, is raising concerns among economists about rising interest costs and potential impacts on investor confidence. Critics argue the situation highlights a lack of fiscal discipline from lawmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts recommend allocating between 10% to 30% of cash savings into CDs, depending on individual financial goals and emergency fund needs. They advise against over-allocating, as other assets like stocks have historically provided better long-term returns against inflation. For those considering CDs, a laddering strategy—splitting deposits into accounts with different maturity dates—is suggested to maintain liquidity while capitalizing on strong short-term rates.

          <h2>Electric Vehicle Maker Rivian to Lay Off Over 600 Employees</h2>

          <p>Rivian Automotive is planning to lay off more than 600 employees, representing about 4% of its workforce, as it confronts a challenging market for electric vehicles. The company is facing headwinds from changing regulations, including the elimination of a federal EV incentive, as well as slower-than-expected consumer demand. Rivian, which lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter, has also narrowed its delivery forecast for the year. The layoffs reflect growing pressure on EV manufacturers as they navigate market shifts and strive for profitability in an increasingly competitive and uncertain environment.</p>

          <p>Despite earlier tensions over trade, relations between the United States and the European Union have reportedly grown closer due to a shared frustration with Russia's refusal to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. This week, Washington and Brussels announced complementary sanctions targeting Russia's vital oil and gas industry, demonstrating a united front. U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Andrew Puzder, stated that both sides are aligned on the need to increase pressure on Moscow. The coordinated action follows President Trump's cancellation of a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, signaling a tougher stance from his administration.</p>

          <p>At least 20 people have died in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) this year, marking the deadliest year for the agency since 2004. This increase coincides with a significant rise in the detainee population, which is now near 60,000. Former officials warn that the combination of a larger population, reduced oversight, and persistent difficulties in hiring medical staff in remote facilities is creating a high-risk environment. Critics and former employees suggest that the gutting of oversight offices and a shift toward more community-based arrests contribute to the dangerous conditions leading to more deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump appears to have abandoned his previous conciliatory approach toward Russia, opting instead for a more confrontational strategy to pressure Moscow over the war in Ukraine. This shift is marked by the cancellation of a planned U.S.-Russia summit in Budapest and the imposition of new, direct sanctions on major Russian oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil. The move signals Trump's growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's unwillingness to compromise on a peace deal. This change in tactics represents a departure from past instances where threats of pressure were followed by diplomatic engagement rather than punitive action.</p>

          <p>A Cuban man, Roberto Mosquera del Peral, who was deported from the United States to the African nation of Eswatini, is on a hunger strike after being held in a maximum-security prison for over three months without charge. His lawyer states his life is "on the line" and that he is being denied access to legal counsel as part of a controversial U.S. third-country deportation program. The program, which sends deportees with criminal records to African nations, has been criticized by human rights groups for denying due process.

The remark, made while discussing his government's efforts to increase deportations, has been widely condemned as racist and echoing the rhetoric of the far-right. Critics accuse Merz of fomenting prejudice and unfairly blaming diverse urban populations for societal problems. Despite the backlash, Merz has defended his comments, suggesting that his concerns about safety are widely shared, particularly among women, a claim that has been refuted by a petition signed by nearly 200,000 people.</p>

          <p>England has won its T20 series against New Zealand 1-0 after the third and final match in Auckland was abandoned due to rain, with only 3.4 overs played.

Captain Harry Brook described the tour as "very worthwhile" despite the limited playtime, emphasizing the benefits of team bonding activities off the field.

          <p>Oil prices jumped more than 5% after the Trump administration announced new sanctions against Russia's two largest crude oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The U.S. Treasury Department cited Moscow's lack of commitment to a peace process in Ukraine as the reason for the move, which aims to harm the Kremlin's ability to fund its war effort. The sanctions caused Brent crude to rise to $65.74 per barrel and U.S. crude to $61.63. This action represents a significant escalation of economic pressure on Russia and introduces new volatility into global energy markets. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategy represents a form of regulation that targets the core of the AI stack—hardware and models—rather than the user-facing applications.

This discrepancy could mean Israel is controlling a significantly larger area, creating what analysts describe as a "buffer zone" or "kill zone."

          <p>Kelly Reichardt's latest film, "The Mastermind," offers a methodical and often humorous character study of a clumsy art thief whose grand ambitions quickly unravel. Set in 1970s Massachusetts, the movie follows J. B. Mooney (Josh O'Connor), an unemployed carpenter who masterminds a poorly conceived plan to steal paintings from a local museum. Rather than focusing on the heist itself, the film explores the chaotic aftermath as J. B.'s selfish and impulsive actions lead him down a path of self-destruction. The film contrasts its patient, atmospheric style with its protagonist's reckless nature to deliver a precise exploration of middle-class malaise and unearned confidence.</p>
