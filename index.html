          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the US is prepared to "fight and win" against China if deterrence fails, urging Asian allies to boost military coordination and defense spending during the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. Hegseth criticized China's increasing military pressure in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, emphasizing the need for allies to act urgently and increase their defense investments. He also addressed concerns about China's influence over the Panama Canal, vowing to prevent its weaponization or control by China. Hegseth's remarks reflect increasing trade frictions and geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Optimism is moderate given the tense international climate.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, citing her as a "highly partisan person" and a supporter of DEI initiatives.

          <p>President Donald Trump promoted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and under U.S. control.
