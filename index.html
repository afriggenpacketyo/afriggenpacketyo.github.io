            <p>China has announced sanctions against several US Congress members, officials, and NGO leaders for what it deems as their 'bad behavior' regarding Hong Kong-related issues. This action is a response to the US imposing sanctions on Chinese officials in Hong Kong, escalating tensions amidst an ongoing trade war between the two nations. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson condemned the US actions as interference in China's internal affairs, emphasizing that any further wrongful actions will be met with resolute retaliation and reciprocal countermeasures from China, signaling a further deterioration of diplomatic relations. Optimism score reflects heightened tensions and potential for further conflict.</p>

The Justice Secretary has acknowledged the need for improved protection for prison officers, and a full independent review of the incident is planned.</p>

            <p>The UK is facing accusations of mimicking Donald Trump's policies and exhibiting colonial impulses through tightened visa restrictions on African and Caribbean nations. Critics argue that these policies disproportionately affect people of color from former colonies, creating a double standard where Ukrainians or those bringing wealth are welcomed. The article highlights the Commonwealth's perceived ineffectiveness and calls for the Caribbean and African nations to emancipate themselves from mental slavery, advocating for new alliances and models of cooperation rooted in mutual respect rather than colonial debt.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry has concluded that 'professional failures' led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The inquiry cited an 'operational misunderstanding' and a 'breach of orders' as contributing factors, resulting in the dismissal of a unit's deputy commander and a reprimand for another commanding officer. While the IDF claims that some of the casualties were Hamas members, video evidence contradicts initial claims that the convoy lacked proper markings. The incident has sparked criticism and calls for an independent investigation, highlighting concerns about accountability and the protection of humanitarian workers in conflict zones.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for Xiamen Airlines in China has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to the increased costs associated with tariffs. Trump's recent increase in tariffs on Chinese imports, met with retaliatory tariffs from China on US goods, has made the delivery economically unviable. The situation highlights the impact of the ongoing trade war on international business and raises concerns about the future of aircraft deliveries.

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) steady, as stronger-than-expected macro data provides room to focus on stabilizing the yuan amid trade tensions with the US. The decision comes after China reported positive economic data for the first quarter. The PBOC's move aligns with expectations, as a Reuters poll indicated that most economists anticipated the bank to hold rates steady. This decision reflects a balancing act between supporting economic growth and managing currency pressures amidst global trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tightened US controls on Nvidia's chip sales to China could benefit domestic AI chipmakers like Huawei, according to analysts. The Commerce Department's export license requirement for Nvidia's H20 GPUs and additional AMD chips creates an opportunity for Chinese companies to grow and improve their solutions. Huawei, in particular, is seen as a leader in China's race to find an Nvidia competitor with its Ascend 910 series. However, export controls also hinder China's ability to produce advanced GPUs at the same scale as Nvidia due to restrictions on accessing chipmaking equipment.</p>

            <p>Ingrid Lindblad won the LPGA's JM Eagle LA Championship, marking her first LPGA victory in her third career tour start. Lindblad converted six birdies Sunday, enough to weather the field and win the LA Championship at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. Fellow rookie Akie Iwai missed a 13-foot putt on the 18th hole that would have forced a playoff. The LA Championship, which is usually held at Wilshire Country Club, moved to El Caballero in 2025 because of course renovations at Wilshire.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's president has offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the US and imprisoned in his country - if Venezuela releases the same number of political prisoners. The Venezuelan government argues that it has no political prisoners - a claim rejected by rights groups. President Donald Trump's administration accuses them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. Washington pays El Salvador to keep those deported in its notorious high-security Terrorism Confinement Center.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used a second Signal chat to discuss last month's airstrikes in Yemen with his wife, brother and personal lawyer, sources told ABC News on Sunday. In response, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois called for him to “resign in disgrace” in a statement on Sunday. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also issued a statement on Sunday, saying that he has “grave concerns about Secretary Hegseth’s ability to maintain the trust and confidence of U.S. servicemembers and the Commander-in-Chief.”</p>
