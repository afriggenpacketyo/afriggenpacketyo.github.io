          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights are expected to participate in the Budapest Pride march in large numbers, defying a police ban enacted under new legislation. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the nationalist government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, which has been criticized for repressing civil liberties. Despite receiving support from over 30 embassies and members of the European Parliament, attendees risk facing misdemeanor charges and fines, highlighting the growing pressure on civil society in Hungary.</p>

          <p>A significant policy rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government regarding the future of nuclear energy. The dispute pits the Economy Minister, who is open to nuclear technology, against the Environment Minister, who insists on adhering to the country's nuclear phase-out plan. This conflict is amplified by Germany's joint energy statement with pro-nuclear France and plans for new gas-fired power plants, which climate experts warn could jeopardize Germany's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2045.</p>

This perspective suggests China is already well-positioned to lead in an area of growing importance to the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has conducted the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Neuralink, helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature through a neck vein, potentially reducing surgical risks and recovery times for BCI technology.</p>
