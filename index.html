        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted the failure of Spirit Airlines, stating he is "good at math" when asked for his reasoning. He argued that the entire ultra-low-cost carrier model, which relies on low base fares supplemented by numerous fees, is unsustainable because it antagonizes customers. Kirby asserted that a business model predicated on creating a negative customer experience cannot succeed in the long term, especially as larger airlines effectively compete with their own basic economy fares. His comments reflect a broader industry skepticism about the viability of the budget airline sector amid rising costs and shifting consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court panel has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after convicting him on multiple counts related to an attempted coup. The charges stem from his efforts to illegally remain in power following his 2022 electoral defeat, which culminated in his supporters storming government buildings. Bolsonaro, who is the first former Brazilian president to be convicted of such a crime, is currently under house arrest and can appeal the sentence. The verdict has deepened political divisions within Brazil and drawn criticism from allies like former U.S. President Donald Trump, who called the trial a "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the New York Yankees' 9/11 anniversary game against the Detroit Tigers, marking his first appearance at a Major League Baseball game since 2021. Prior to the game, he met with the team in the clubhouse and delivered a speech. The event at Yankee Stadium featured heightened security, partly due to the president's attendance and also in the wake of the recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The visit was a commemorative occasion, with the stadium scoreboard displaying highlights from the 2001 World Series, which took place shortly after the September 11th attacks.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, members of Congress from both political parties are reassessing their security protocols for public appearances. Several lawmakers have postponed outdoor rallies or moved scheduled press conferences indoors, citing an abundance of caution due to rising concerns over political violence. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace stated she would resume carrying a firearm for her safety, reflecting a broader anxiety on Capitol Hill. The incident, involving a shooter firing from a rooftop, has prompted a significant reevaluation of the safety of outdoor events for public figures.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course, began with Routh representing himself and forfeiting his opening statement. The judge cut him off after he delivered a rambling speech that mentioned Adolf Hitler and global conflicts, deeming it irrelevant to the case. Prosecutors then laid out their argument, describing Routh's actions as a carefully crafted and deadly serious plot, citing his possession of military-grade rifles and a trail of lies. Routh has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from a diverse range of political figures, including President Donald Trump and former presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton. In a rare moment of bipartisan agreement, leaders denounced the act as despicable and called for an end to political violence. President Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and blamed the killing on what he termed "radical left" rhetoric. Meanwhile, other politicians emphasized the need for civility and debate over violence, highlighting the tragic irony that Kirk was a proponent of engaging in public discourse.</p>

The Justice Department wants the stay lifted before the Federal Open Market Committee's crucial meeting next week, where a decision on lowering interest rates is expected. President Trump moved to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, last month over allegations of mortgage fraud, which a lower court found was not legally sufficient cause for removal. The move is part of a broader conflict between the president and the central bank over its interest rate policy.</p>

          <p>Amazon has suspended a Palestinian software engineer after he posted messages on internal Slack channels protesting the company's work with the Israeli government. The engineer, Ahmed Shahrour, had criticized Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint cloud computing contract between Amazon, Google, and Israel, urging the company to drop its involvement. The suspension highlights growing activism among tech workers who oppose their companies' business dealings with the Israeli military. Shahrour alleges that Amazon has also taken other steps to silence pro-Palestinian employee speech, including deleting posts and warning other employees.</p>

Discovery's assets, which include DC superheroes, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones, would establish a dominant force in theatrical releases and streaming. The deal would also consolidate significant sports media rights, including the UFC, NHL, and March Madness, creating a powerful competitor to existing giants like Disney and its ESPN division.</p>

          <p>With the latest consumer price index report showing that inflation rose to 2.9% in August, this article suggests that investors may want to consider gold as a hedge. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset that tends to maintain its value, and can even rise in price, during periods of economic uncertainty and currency devaluation. The article notes that while inflation is cyclical, the recent upward trend could make a portfolio allocation to gold a prudent strategy to protect purchasing power, though it cautions against over-investing.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging that the ride-hailing company engages in systemic discrimination against people with disabilities. The complaint, filed in federal court, claims that Uber and its drivers routinely violate the Americans with Disabilities Act by refusing to serve riders who use service animals or stowable wheelchairs. The lawsuit also accuses Uber of imposing improper surcharges, such as cleaning fees related to service animals. Uber has stated that it has a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and fundamentally disagrees with the DOJ's allegations.</p>

          <p>The search for the next chair of the Federal Reserve is actively underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent leading the process by meeting with several potential candidates. Recent interviews included former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard, who are on President Trump's short list. In addition to vetting candidates, Bessent is reportedly advocating for a reform agenda at the central bank, aiming to reduce the Fed's massive bond portfolio and lessen its overall economic footprint.

          <p>Average mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in almost a year, with 30-year terms now at 6.35%. This continued decline is attributed to expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The lower rates may present a significant opportunity for prospective homebuyers and homeowners considering a refinance. The article advises consumers to assess their financial situations and weigh the risks of waiting for potentially lower rates against the possibility that they could rise again, as they did in 2024.

          <p>As part of a new trade deal, Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in U.S.-based projects in exchange for a lower 15% baseline tariff rate.

After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift heavily in favor of the United States, with America receiving 90% and Japan 10%.
