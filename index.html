          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded the immediate removal of homeless people from Washington, D.C., promising to provide alternative shelter far from the capital. This directive is part of a broader, intensified focus on crime in the city, despite official data showing a decline in violent crime rates. Trump's rhetoric has escalated following a recent assault on a former administration official, and he plans to deploy federal law enforcement to address the issue, drawing criticism from local Democratic leaders.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket tournament, Southern Brave secured a decisive nine-wicket victory over Birmingham Phoenix, largely due to a strong bowling performance. England's Jofra Archer claimed two wickets for 16 runs, while New Zealand's Michael Bracewell took three for 10, restricting Phoenix to a low score of 106-7. Southern Brave's batsmen, Leus du Plooy and James Vince, chased the target comfortably, reaching it with 19 balls remaining and placing their team at the top of the league table.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Texas Republican Representative Tony Gonzales discussed U.S. immigration policy, defending the actions of ICE agents against criticism. He argued for focusing enforcement on violent criminals rather than minor offenders, suggesting that new funding will enable more targeted operations. Gonzales also addressed concerns about the indefinite detention of migrant children and the use of military facilities like Fort Bliss for housing detainees, acknowledging the complexities but supporting current measures for streamlined processing.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte stated that the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is a crucial opportunity to test Russia's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Rutte emphasized that any potential deal must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and future, even while acknowledging the complex reality of Russian-controlled territory. While Rutte praised Trump's efforts to pressure Russia, former national security adviser John Bolton expressed concern that the meeting could legitimize Putin and that negotiations might be sliding in Russia's favor.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as Surgeon General under the first Trump administration, sharply criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for his response to a shooting at the CDC's Atlanta campus. Adams also condemned Kennedy's decision to halt $500 million in mRNA vaccine research, calling the technology one of President Trump's greatest achievements and warning that cutting its funding will cost lives. He argued that the secretary's rhetoric has fanned the flames of anti-science sentiment and undermined public health institutions.</p>

          <p>Former baseball star David Justice recently discussed his 1990s marriage and subsequent divorce from actress Halle Berry, attributing their split to his own immaturity and traditional expectations at the time. Justice explained that his perspective on a wife's role was based on his Midwest upbringing, which clashed with Berry's burgeoning Hollywood career. He admitted that they never had issues with infidelity and believes their marriage might have survived with therapy, providing a retrospective look at their high-profile relationship.</p>

The meeting was requested by several European council members, who, along with other nations, have expressed strong opposition to the plan, fearing a violation of international humanitarian law and a worsening humanitarian crisis.</p>

Fulfilling a campaign promise to end the war, Trump's direct engagement with the isolated Russian leader raises fears that a potential deal could involve ceding Ukrainian territory. The meeting, brokered through back-channel discussions, bypasses traditional diplomacy and puts Trump's self-professed dealmaking skills at the center of a high-stakes effort to resolve Europe's largest conflict since World War II.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to cardiologists, individuals with high blood pressure should avoid taking licorice root supplements, as well as consuming licorice in other forms like tea or candy. The compound glycyrrhizin, found in licorice, can dangerously elevate blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance strains the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including headaches, fluid retention, and even an abnormal heart rhythm. Doctors advise consulting a physician before starting any new supplement.</p>
