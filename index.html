          <h2>Schumer Calls for Investigation into FAA Amid Newark Airport Chaos</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, citing a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, old technology, and depleted federal funds as key issues. The problems, which have caused hundreds of flight delays and cancellations, are attributed to equipment outages and staffing shortages at the Philadelphia air traffic control center that oversees Newark's airspace. United Airlines has cut 35 roundtrip flights daily due to the disruptions, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to release a new plan to revamp the air traffic control system this week. The situation is exacerbated by runway construction, limiting the number of planes that can take off and land, prompting calls for immediate solutions to prevent further travel disruptions.</p>

          <p>The City Parks Foundation has canceled R&B singer Kehlani's scheduled Central Park performance, citing security concerns raised by the Adams administration. This decision follows a warning from a top New York City official that the group's license to stage the SummerStage concert series could be at risk if the concert proceeded. The cancellation comes after Cornell University also dropped Kehlani from headlining a concert due to the singer's pro-Palestinian stance, which they deemed antisemitic. Kehlani, who has been vocal about her anti-genocide views and criticism of the Israeli government, expressed being unfazed by the cancellation and reaffirmed her commitment to her art.</p>

          <p>Michael Rogers, the FDA's associate commissioner for inspections and investigations, has abruptly retired after 34 years with the agency, reportedly amid frustration with the FDA's new commissioner and sweeping cuts ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Rogers oversaw food inspections during the infant formula crisis and the reorganization of the FDA's inspections office. The cuts come as Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary plans to expand foreign surprise inspections while shortening the length of foreign inspection trips.

          <p>Travelers at Newark Liberty International Airport continue to face major delays and cancellations due to air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and runway construction.

The proposal aims to support the entertainment industry and retain film and television production in the United States. This initiative follows Trump's social media post advocating for a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the country, causing confusion and concern in Hollywood. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal, reflecting bipartisan efforts to address the challenges faced by the industry due to international competition.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, spoke out after being detained during a citizenship interview, stating that President Trump "will not silence me." Mahdawi, who helped lead Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a rarely used law allowing the government to revoke visas. He criticized the Trump administration's rationale as "laughable" and emphasized his commitment to peace. Mahdawi's detention has raised concerns about the suppression of student activism and free speech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. Judge Jamal Whitehead rejected the administration's interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling, stating that the government must continue processing refugees who had already been approved for travel to the U.S. The order requires the administration to resume processing cases and facilitate admission for those refugees whose clearances have not lapsed, marking a legal victory for refugee aid groups and affected individuals.</p>
