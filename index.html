        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing expectations and narrowly avoiding a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a significant surge in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products, as companies reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, economists express caution, noting that while domestic consumption showed a slight recovery, the overall pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained due to softening global trade and slowing investment. Future economic performance may be challenged by the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared former President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The ruling states that the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the policy, which has been on hold amid numerous legal challenges since it was signed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed executive orders aimed at establishing the U.S. as a global leader in artificial intelligence, with a specific focus on deregulation and eliminating perceived political bias. One order targets what the White House terms "woke" AI, requiring federally funded companies to maintain politically neutral models free from ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Another order seeks to expedite the construction of data centers by easing environmental regulations. These actions are part of a broader "AI action plan" designed to accelerate development by removing "red tape" and promoting the export of American AI technology.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which analysts view as an indirect strategy to reshape regional supply chains and counter China's economic influence.

While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the deals are seen as a way to contain China's regional dominance. However, experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, having increasingly localized their production within these countries, potentially mitigating the impact of the new U.S. arrangements.

Spain, who won that encounter, will be looking to complete a treble of major trophies, while England aims to defend its European champion title. Both teams are considered the best in Europe, setting the stage for a dramatic and closely contested match. While England's squad has seen some changes since their last meeting, former players and pundits believe the Lionesses have the capability to defeat the world champions in this one-off game.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has characterized the current stock market as a mixed environment, driven by both positive and negative forces. He pointed to positive factors like a less severe than feared trade deal with Japan and strong earnings from several major companies, including Alphabet. However, Cramer also expressed concern about "froth" in the market, citing speculative trading in certain stocks that reminds him of previous market bubbles. He advised investors to be "skeptical, but not cynical," suggesting that while there are risks, there are also significant opportunities for profit in the current landscape.

          <p>Vehicle production in the United Kingdom during the first half of the year has dropped to its lowest point since 1953, not counting the COVID-19 pandemic period. Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) shows a 7.3% fall in car output and a 45% plunge in van production. The decline is partly attributed to uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some manufacturers to slow or halt production lines. While production of electric and hybrid vehicles saw a slight increase, the industry body expressed doubt about reaching pre-pandemic output levels anytime soon, highlighting significant challenges for the UK's automotive sector.

          <p>As the Los Angeles Rams, considered a Super Bowl contender, open their training camp, they face several key concerns despite a talented roster. Quarterback Matthew Stafford is starting camp with back soreness, limiting his participation in early drills, a worrying sign for the team's most critical player. The offensive line is also a question mark, with left tackle Alaric Jackson dealing with a recurring blood-clot issue and his replacement, D.J. Humphries, coming off a major knee injury. Other issues to watch include the depth at the cornerback position and the ongoing contract negotiations for star running back Kyren Williams.</p>

          <p>A historical exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument in California has been altered, becoming the first known instance of compliance with a Trump administration executive order to remove "unpatriotic" language from national parks. The original 2021 exhibit, "History Under Construction," had added context to an existing sign, including the role of Indigenous peoples and the racist views of some historical figures like John Muir. Following the order, these additions were removed, restoring the sign to its previous, less complete version. Former park staff who created the expanded exhibit criticized the move as an act of censorship that erases a more complex and inclusive telling of American history.</p>

          <p>According to The Wall Street Journal, Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times within the Department of Justice's files on Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing reportedly occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not be releasing the files to the public, a decision that drew criticism from some of Trump's supporters. The report states Trump was also told many other high-profile individuals were named and that the files contained unverified hearsay.

          <p>Southern California Edison has announced it will launch a direct compensation program for victims of the deadly Eaton fire, in a move aimed at avoiding protracted and costly litigation. The program will be open to individuals and businesses who suffered property loss, injury, or the death of a family member in the January blaze. While the official cause is still under investigation, a leading theory involves Edison's equipment, and the utility stated it wants to resolve claims fairly and promptly. Some attorneys for fire victims expressed skepticism, suggesting such programs have historically resulted in underpaying victims compared to legal settlements.</p>

Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the request did not meet the strict legal criteria required to bypass federal rules on grand jury secrecy, stating her "hands are tied." The decision is a setback for the Trump administration's push for transparency in the case, which came after public pressure. This ruling does not affect separate, pending requests in New York to release grand jury materials from the later investigation that led to Epstein's 2019 indictment.</p>

This is not an isolated incident, with similar submerged ceremonies occurring in previous years due to typhoons and seasonal monsoons.

The legal action, filed in Delaware, states that Owens has spread "outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions" and refused requests for a retraction. Owens responded to the lawsuit by standing by her allegations and describing the legal action as a "desperate public relations strategy."</p>
