          <p>As the Trump administration attempts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has threatened to strike Iran’s main nuclear enrichment facilities. Tensions between Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump stem from their differing views on exploiting Iran’s current weakness.

The central divide in the negotiations is whether Iran must halt all enrichment of nuclear material.
