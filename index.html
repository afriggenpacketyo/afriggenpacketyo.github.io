          <p>Paramount Skydance is reportedly working with investment banks to prepare an all-cash offer for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery. While no official offer has been received, the news caused WBD's stock to surge over 25%. This potential consolidation comes as the media industry grapples with the shift to streaming, which has disrupted traditional pay-TV models. The move follows the recent merger of Paramount and Skydance and WBD's own plans to separate its TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge's ruling that blocked the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had argued that Cook's reinstatement was in the public interest to maintain the Federal Reserve's independence. President Trump sought to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her lawyers contend the firing is a pretext in a broader campaign to pressure the Fed on interest rates.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, WNBA star Natasha Cloud has made an emotional call for stricter gun legislation in the United States. In a series of social media posts, Cloud expressed her exhaustion with gun violence and argued that the Second Amendment was not intended for modern military-grade weapons. She emphasized that gun violence affects everyone regardless of political affiliation or wealth and urged lawmakers to prioritize legislative action over prayers to protect families from such tragedies.</p>

          <p>In response to the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk, the White House made a last-minute decision to move the annual 9/11 Commemoration Ceremony at the Pentagon. The event was relocated from the traditional 9/11 memorial site to the building's inner courtyard as a security precaution. This change underscores the heightened security concerns following what officials are treating as a political assassination. The article also notes that Vice President JD Vance traveled to Salt Lake City to meet with Kirk's family.</p>

          <p>Beijing has strongly condemned a proposal by the Mexican government to increase tariffs by up to 50% on certain imports, a move widely seen as targeting Chinese products. A Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson stated that Beijing firmly rejects actions taken under coercion and will protect its interests. The Mexican government argues the tariffs are necessary to protect local jobs in key sectors like automotive and textiles. The proposal comes amid increasing pressure from the United States for its trading partners to adopt a more confrontational stance toward China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has extended restrictions on federal agents' use of 'less-lethal' weapons like projectile launchers and tear gas during protests in Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera ruled that the First Amendment requires protecting journalists and peaceful protesters from indiscriminate force, which he described as having been used with 'surprising savagery.' The ruling bars the use of such weapons against reporters, legal observers, and non-threatening protesters unless there is an immediate and serious threat of physical harm, marking a victory for press freedom and civil liberties groups.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Filippo Ganna won the 18th stage of the Vuelta a Espana, an individual time trial that was significantly shortened due to security concerns over planned protests. The stage was reduced from 27.2km to 12.2km to better protect the riders. In the overall race standings, leader Jonas Vingegaard saw his advantage shrink slightly as second-place rider Joao Almeida finished ten seconds faster in the time trial.

          <p>Professional golfer Patrick Reed has stated that paying American players to participate in the Ryder Cup is 'unnecessary.' His comments come as U.S. players are set to receive $500,000 each for the upcoming event, with a portion designated for charity. Reed, a former Ryder Cup standout, likened the event to the Olympics, arguing that the honor of representing one's country should be the sole motivation, not a monetary reward. European players have historically not been paid for their participation in the biennial golf tournament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% in 2026, according to new estimates based on recent inflation data. This would be a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by about $54. However, advocacy groups and analysts warn that this increase may not be sufficient to cover rising costs for seniors, particularly with Medicare Part B premiums also expected to rise, potentially negating much of the benefit increase for many retirees.

Farage has denied providing the funds, stating his partner could afford it due to her 'wealthy French family,' a claim a BBC investigation found little evidence to support.</p>
