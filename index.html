          <p>Announcing a major trade agreement with Japan, President Trump stated the deal includes a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. The agreement, which Trump called potentially the largest ever, also involves a purported $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The announcement followed tense negotiations and came after Japan's ruling coalition lost its majority, with the deal providing a potential political boost for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Japanese auto stocks surged in response to the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of Brian Holmes, who died at Castle Hill Hospital after a heart procedure, claims the hospital issued a second, altered death certificate to hide a medical mistake. An unpublished review seen by the BBC found that Mr. Holmes received "very poor care" and that the initial cause of death, a failed TAVI procedure, was removed from the official record. The hospital is currently under police investigation for several deaths related to the same procedure, with a mortality rate above the national average. The family was unaware of the full extent of the errors until the review was revealed.</p>

          <p>Police in Hillsborough County, Florida, are warning parents about a dangerous social media trend known as the "door kick challenge." The warning comes after five minors were involved in an incident where they kicked a homeowner's front door and fired an airsoft gun before fleeing. Authorities released video of the event and expressed concern that such pranks could escalate into tragic situations if homeowners react defensively. Experts suggest that participants are motivated by the desire for online attention and "clout" without considering the severe potential consequences.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced significant gains following reports of a new U.S.-Japan trade agreement. The deal reportedly lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, providing a major boost to Japan's auto industry, which is a cornerstone of its economy. Toyota's stock jumped over 11%, while Mazda surged more than 17%, reflecting market relief and optimism after a period of uncertainty over potential tariff hikes. The positive market reaction underscores the economic importance of auto exports to the United States for Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Worcestershire-based musician, Anna Downes, has criticized West Mercia Police for their handling of her cyberflashing case, stating she felt "ignored" and "a nuisance." After receiving unsolicited explicit images from a fellow musician she had met once, it took nearly six months and media intervention for the perpetrator to be arrested and convicted. Cyberflashing became a specific crime in the UK in 2023, but Ms. Downes' experience highlights challenges in enforcement and victim support. She chose to waive her anonymity to encourage others to report such crimes and to advocate for them to be taken more seriously.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed all national sports governing bodies to comply with President Trump's executive order, effectively barring transgender women from competing in women's sports. In a letter, the USOPC stated its obligation as a federally chartered organization to align with federal policy, which threatens to rescind funding for non-compliant organizations. This move follows a similar policy change by the NCAA and has been condemned by groups like the National Women's Law Center as sacrificing athletes' needs for political demands.

The dam is projected to generate 300 billion kWh of electricity annually but has raised significant security and ecological alarms for neighboring India. The project's location on the Yarlung Zangbo River, which flows into India as the Brahmaputra, gives Beijing control over a vital water source for the region. This development is seen not just as an energy initiative but as a move with profound geopolitical and environmental implications.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from the Los Angeles Times characterizes July 2025 as a month of "capitulation," citing several instances of institutions seemingly bending to pressure from the Trump administration. The article points to the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" by Paramount, which is seeking federal approval for a merger, as a potential move to appease the President. It also highlights House Speaker Mike Johnson's decision to cut short a workweek to thwart a bipartisan investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein.

An Obama spokesperson dismissed the allegations as "bizarre," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction."

          <p>The civil war in Sudan has escalated as the oil-rich Kordofan region becomes a new major front line between the national army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Both sides are vying for control of the strategically vital area, which controls the country's oil supply and pipelines crucial to South Sudan. Recent attacks have resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths, with both the army's airstrikes and RSF ground attacks drawing condemnation for targeting non-combatants. The intensified fighting in Kordofan represents a dangerous new phase in a conflict that has already displaced 12 million people.</p>

          <p>One month after Israeli airstrikes targeted Iran's notorious Evin Prison, inmates who were transferred to other facilities report facing "unbearable and inhumane conditions." Families of political prisoners told the BBC about severe overcrowding, lack of beds and air conditioning, and insect infestations in prisons like Fashafouyeh. The original attack, which Israel claimed targeted intelligence operations, killed 80 people and has been labeled a potential war crime by Amnesty International. The transferred detainees, including political dissidents and human rights defenders, now face new hardships in facilities known for even worse conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company is set to implement a "low double-digit" price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the unprecedented cost of cocoa. The price of cocoa has skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa, caused by climate change-related weather events and disease, as well as chronic underinvestment in farms. This move will affect iconic brands like Hershey Kisses and Reese's. The company stated the price hike is unrelated to trade policy and reflects the global reality of rising ingredient costs, as it also pivots towards producing snacks that are less cocoa-intensive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is deliberately purging women from the U.S. military's senior ranks. The author points to the recent removal of several high-ranking female officers, including the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy and the first female Chief of Naval Operations. The article connects these firings to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's previously stated views, which describe the inclusion of women in combat roles as "social engineering." The author contends this sends a chilling message that women are not welcome in leadership, undermining military readiness.</p>

          <p>Residents of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile are raising concerns about "overtourism," pointing to the proliferation of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous thoroughfare. Locals argue that the dominance of these shops has displaced essential businesses like grocers and butchers, making the area less livable for families. The number of pupils at the local primary school has fallen by 29%, which some attribute to the pressures of mass tourism. While tourism supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, some residents feel the balance has tipped too far, eroding the community's character.</p>
