          <p>The White House has strongly criticized Illinois Governor JB Pritzker for rejecting President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago to combat crime. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson accused Pritzker of prioritizing "anti-Trump creds" over public safety, calling him a "slob" on social media. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, deemed the administration's "ultimatum" as "absolutely outrageous and un-American," refusing the deployment without state consent. This political clash highlights ongoing tensions between the federal government and state leadership regarding domestic law enforcement and the appropriate use of military assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, found no evidence necessitating federalized troops and argued against circumventing her prior decision to deny Oregon's National Guard deployment. The ruling emphasized that using the military without state consent risks sovereignty and inflames tensions. Trump's deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, criticized the decision as an "egregious violation of constitutional order," while the White House expressed confidence in the president's legal authority to deploy forces.</p>

          <p>England captain Harry Kane has indicated a willingness to discuss a new contract with Bayern Munich, signaling a diminished interest in returning to the Premier League. Kane, halfway through his four-year deal, has achieved remarkable success with the German club, scoring 103 goals in 106 appearances and helping secure the 2024-25 Bundesliga title, his first career honor. Despite ongoing speculation and a desire from Tottenham's manager for his return, Kane stated his perspective on moving back to England has cooled. He affirmed his current commitment to Bayern, expressing full focus on future achievements with the team.</p>

          <p>Miami Beach's rainbow-colored crosswalk, a symbol of the LGBTQ+ community's history and contributions, has been removed by the Florida Department of Transportation. This action follows a state order for the removal of all street art, which Miami Beach officials unsuccessfully appealed. Critics view this as the latest move by Governor Ron DeSantis's administration against the LGBTQ+ community, alongside other restrictive policies. City officials collected the pavers for future repurposing, while the Governor maintains the decision is about using streets for their "intended purpose."</p>

          <p>China is drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial document outlining national development goals, with a significant focus on restoring confidence within the private sector. Entrepreneurs have faced years of sluggish demand, intense price wars, and unexpected administrative penalties, leading to widespread fatigue. Despite numerous government measures, over 60% of private businesses still describe the economic climate as "difficult." The upcoming plan seeks to address these challenges and help private firms remain competitive in an unpredictable global environment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would consider pardons for convicted sexual trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell and hip-hop mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs. Trump's comments on Maxwell came after the Supreme Court denied her appeal, despite him claiming he hadn't "heard the name in so long." He also mentioned Combs, referring to him by an old nickname, had requested a pardon following his recent prostitution conviction. These statements have drawn renewed scrutiny to Trump's past associations and his use of presidential clemency.</p>

While federal data indicated a rise in violent crime in Memphis, local police reported a decline, with murder at a six-year low. The differences are attributed to varying geographical scopes—FBI data covers a nine-county metro area, while MPD focuses on city limits—and different counting methods, with the FBI tallying each victim versus MPD counting each incident. Experts urge caution and clarity when discussing crime data to avoid misinforming the public.</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, owner of Modelo, reiterated its lowered full-year guidance despite beating top and bottom-line estimates in its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. The company cited a "challenging macroeconomic environment" and aluminum tariffs as factors impacting its operating margin and net sales. Notably, Constellation identified a trend of reduced demand from Hispanic consumers, which it linked to concerns about President Trump's immigration policies and potential job losses. CEO Bill Newlands stated the company remains focused on strategic objectives to navigate these market conditions.</p>

The article criticizes the tone-deafness and "willful trolling" from both sides, exemplified by AI-generated videos and partisan out-of-office messages. While lawmakers engage in this rhetorical exercise, federal employees remain furloughed or unpaid, and critical government functions, like data reporting and wildfire preparedness, are scaled back.

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account as the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates. While returns are currently similar across various short-term options, CDs offer fixed rates, guaranteeing interest, whereas high-yield savings account rates are variable and likely to decline with future Fed cuts. Savers are advised to consider a strategic approach, potentially splitting funds between both account types. This allows for exploiting current high rates while maintaining some flexibility, emphasizing the importance of avoiding traditional low-interest savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>
