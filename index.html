          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer revealed he has developed an understanding of Donald Trump's motivations through a personal relationship built on shared family values. Starmer explained this rapport was instrumental in securing a vital deal exempting key UK industries from certain US tariffs, underscoring the national interest in such connections. He recounted that their relationship began with a personal phone call from Trump offering condolences after the death of Starmer's brother. This personal diplomacy has also yielded benefits with other world leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illicit gains. The firm is accused of using manipulative trading strategies to artificially influence India's Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices for profit, despite prior warnings from the National Stock Exchange. SEBI's interim order described Jane Street as an untrustworthy actor whose actions threatened market integrity, a move seen by some as a necessary crackdown to protect investors.

          <p>Donald Trump's major legislative package, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," has passed Congress, marking a significant political victory for his second term. The bill combines massive tax cuts with increased spending on military and immigration enforcement, while also cutting over $1 trillion from health programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Critics highlight that the legislation is projected to add approximately $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade and is unpopular with a majority of voters, according to recent polls.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Interior Department to develop a strategy for charging foreign visitors higher entrance fees at U.S. national parks. The order, framed under an "America First" policy, aims to keep prices low for Americans while generating an estimated $90 million annually from the surcharge on non-U.S. residents. The directive also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access systems, such as lotteries or permits, and revokes a 2017 Obama-era memorandum promoting diversity and inclusion in parks.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken an individual into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The person, who was unarmed, traversed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and was safely guided out by South Korean troops. The Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the individual will be investigated by relevant authorities to determine the circumstances of the crossing. Such crossings are rare and dangerous due to the extensive fortifications along the border.</p>

          <p>A strike by bin collectors in Birmingham, UK, has entered its sixth month, leaving residents to contend with "apocalyptic" piles of uncollected rubbish and recycling. The industrial action by Unite union members began in January over council plans to downgrade roles as part of an effort to settle equal pay liabilities. With recycling collections suspended, residents express frustration and concern over the growing waste, while the city council's recycling rate has plummeted, becoming one of the lowest in the country.</p>

          <p>Veterans, military families, and legal experts are raising alarms over the Trump administration's deployment of troops for domestic law enforcement, such as in Los Angeles to support ICE operations. Critics argue that this practice erodes democratic norms, violates the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act, and places unprepared service members in inappropriate and stressful situations. Advocates from groups like the Secure Families Initiative state that these domestic deployments strain military families and pit troops against the American citizens they are sworn to protect.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that nearly half of the 56,000 immigrants currently held in ICE detention have no criminal convictions, and this group has seen the sharpest growth in recent months. According to the Deportation Data Project at UCLA, this contradicts the administration's stated focus on arresting and deporting violent criminals. The trend reflects a broader enforcement strategy where being in the U.S. without legal status is sufficient cause for detention, leading to the arrest of long-term residents and community members with no criminal record.</p>

          <p>Significant staffing shortages at U.S. national parks, including a lack of lifeguards at popular sites like Assateague Island National Seashore, are raising safety concerns. Advocacy groups attribute the shortages to a federal hiring freeze and budget cuts under the Trump administration, which have led to a 24% loss in permanent staff since 2024. While the National Park Service acknowledges a nationwide lifeguard shortage, critics argue that the administration's policies have created a dysfunctional situation that puts visitors in jeopardy during the busy summer season.</p>
