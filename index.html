          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of the posts he made about US President Donald Trump during a recent social media exchange. This comes after Trump declared that their relationship was over and that he had no interest in mending ties with Musk. Musk had previously called Trump's tax bill a "disgusting abomination," leading to a public fallout between the two figures. Musk took to his platform X to express his remorse, saying that some of his posts about President Donald Trump went too far.</p>

          <p>A former student killed ten people and then himself in a mass shooting at a high school in Graz, Austria. Austrian police found a non-functional homemade bomb and a farewell letter at the shooter's house, but the letter did not reveal a motive. The incident is one of the worst attacks in Europe in the past decade and the deadliest school shooting in Austria's history post-World War II. Austria is observing three days of national mourning, and the shooting has sparked renewed debate over Austria's gun laws, which permit revolvers, pistols, and semi-automatic weapons with a permit. </p>

Deterring and defending the eastern part of the alliance area has become a core task for NATO states, and Gerhartz's promotion underscores Germany's role in the alliance.

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel indicated that Commerzbank's current share price is too high for a takeover offer to be viable. UniCredit has acquired a 28% stake in Commerzbank since September through derivatives and has the ECB's approval to increase its holdings to 29.9%. Orcel stressed that UniCredit is currently "far away" from a merger bid with Commerzbank and would first seek a "constructive solution" to opposition from the German government. Orcel said his bank was initially invited to bid on Commerzbank, yet UniCredit's play has been met with continuous resistance from both the German lender and the Berlin administration.

          <p>The United States risks losing its dominance in space as China rapidly advances in commercial space technology, according to experts. Concerns are rising over proposed cuts to funding for commercial satellite imagery, which is critical for military operations and national security. China's government-funded commercial imaging company, CGST, operates over 100 satellites and is positioning itself to collect intelligence at scale. Experts argue that the U.S. needs to increase investment in commercial space capabilities and modernize procurement processes to maintain its leadership in the space domain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 aims to consolidate the McKinney-Vento federal grant program with 17 other programs and dramatically cut funding. This proposal could weaken the federal law that helps homeless students get an education. The McKinney-Vento Act includes legal protections and a grant program to help schools cover the costs of educating students experiencing homelessness.

          <p>President Trump's legal team is appealing his criminal conviction, arguing that the case should be moved to federal court because prosecutors relied on evidence related to his official acts as president. Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a payment to Stormy Daniels. Legal scholars say this particular appeal is unlikely to succeed, but it's an example of Trump's legal team using every tool at their disposal.

          <p>A new study in JAMA Pediatrics indicates that states with more permissive gun laws experienced a rise in pediatric deaths from firearm injuries between 2011 and 2023, while states with stricter laws did not. The study examined firearm deaths of children 17 and under after the 2010 Supreme Court case McDonald vs. Chicago. Researchers grouped states into most permissive, permissive, and least permissive categories based on gun laws. States with the most permissive laws had more than 6,000 excess deaths than expected, and the study suggests that specific laws, such as child access prevention laws, can help prevent gun deaths in kids and teens.</p>

          <p>Salmonella, a common cause of food poisoning, is named after Daniel E. Salmon, an American veterinary pathologist from the late 19th century. While Salmon's name is associated with the bacteria, there is debate over the role of his laboratory assistant, Theobald Smith, who is believed to have isolated the microorganism. One of the earliest and most famous cases of a salmonella outbreak involved Mary Mallon, an asymptomatic carrier of salmonella typhi, who unknowingly infected several families while working as a cook. The case of Mallon highlights the complexities between protecting public health and preserving individual freedoms.</p>

          <p>An article examines the Trump administration's ongoing assault on universities, tracing its roots back to the 1970s and 80s. It argues that the Republican party has been trying to humble universities for political reasons, namely to counter the trend that college-educated people tend to vote Democratic. The article references Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership as a blueprint for the attack on universities. Christopher Rufo, the conservative activist behind the attack on critical race theory and gender studies, has openly described the Republican attack on universities as a “counter-revolution” planned well before the campus protests.</p>
