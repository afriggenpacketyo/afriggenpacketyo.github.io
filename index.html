            <p>Senator Bernie Sanders asserted that his recent "Fighting Oligarchy" rally with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Los Angeles drew a crowd of approximately 36,000 people, making both Donald Trump and Elon Musk "very nervous". Sanders mocked Musk's previous claim that attendees at a similar rally were paid organizers, emphasizing the grassroots nature of the movement. He criticized the concentration of wealth among billionaires and Trump's alleged authoritarian tendencies. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez plan to continue their tour with upcoming rallies in several other states. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Luis R Conriquez concert at the Feria del Palenque de Texcoco in Mexico erupted in chaos after the singer, warned by authorities, refused to perform "corridos b√©licos" (war corridos) dedicated to drug trafficking figures. The audience reacted angrily, throwing objects at the stage, leading Conriquez to cut the show short. The crowd then invaded the stage, destroying musical instruments. This incident raises questions about Conriquez's upcoming U.S. tour and whether he will censor his performances due to increased scrutiny of narcocorridos by federal authorities, exemplified by the recent visa revocation of Los Alegres del Barranco.</p>

The study highlights a significant increase in AMR-related infections in children over the past three years, potentially exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report's authors point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections.</p>

He argues that it is "very popular" and eliminates the "big inconvenience" and "costly event" of changing clocks. The Sunshine Protection Act, reintroduced in the House and Senate, aims to achieve this. While there is support for ending the clock changes, some experts argue that permanent standard time is more beneficial for health.</p>
