            <h2>Trump Administration Faces Legal Challenge Over Alien Enemies Act Deportations in Colorado</h2>

            <p>A federal court in Denver heard arguments in a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, specifically Venezuelans, deemed "dangerous." Immigrants' rights groups argue that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is insufficient for them to mount a legal defense, potentially violating their due process rights. The ACLU's legal director highlighted that even alleged Nazis received more rights after World War II, and the Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations from Texas under the same act. The administration defends its actions by citing an "invasion" by the Tren de Aragua gang and claims authority under the 1798 law, which was last invoked during World War II to hold Japanese Americans at internment camps.</p>

            <p>After a five-year pause, the U.S. Department of Education will resume collecting defaulted student loans, impacting over 5 million borrowers who haven't made payments in the past year. The department will notify borrowers via email, urging them to make payments or enroll in repayment plans before referring them to a Treasury Department collections program. Critics argue that this decision comes at a particularly difficult time for borrowers facing economic uncertainty, especially older individuals on fixed incomes who are disproportionately in default. The Education Department plans to begin garnishing wages later in the summer, further impacting borrowers' financial stability.</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC discusses the challenges faced by Apple and Nvidia due to the Trump administration's trade policies and attitude towards China. He asserts that the government is biased against these companies, particularly Nvidia, believing it doesn't do enough to prevent China from acquiring its products. Apple is also caught in the crosshairs of the trade war, with the White House reportedly expecting the company to manufacture its products in the U.S. or nowhere. Cramer trimmed positions in these stocks due to the uncertainty, but notes that the administration could potentially roll back some of its punitive policies if the situation worsens.

This strategy comes at a cost, as AI companies are wildly unprofitable and rely on investor funding.

The Real ID law was passed in 2005 to enhance the security of state-issued identification. Travelers without a Real ID will be subject to additional screening, potentially causing delays. A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID.</p>

Trump's attacks raise questions about whether he has the authority to fire Powell, who has earned praise for managing monetary policy effectively. Experts note that Federal Reserve chairs can only be removed "for cause," and that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to negative economic consequences. Powell has indicated he would not step down if asked and that presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.</p>
