          <p>BBC Sport previews the Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham, highlighting the underperformance of both teams this season. Sami Mokbel argues that Tottenham's season has been unacceptable, despite a potential Europa League victory, while Simon Stone contends that Manchester United's struggles are largely self-inflicted due to managerial changes and poor player performance. The article points out that injuries have debilitated Tottenham's season, while United have struggled with consistency and financial losses. Both correspondents agree that winning the Europa League would provide some redemption, but questions remain about the future of both clubs and their respective managers. </p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that US export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China have been ineffective, as Chinese companies are now turning to locally developed alternatives. Huang indicated that these restrictions have inadvertently boosted China's domestic semiconductor industry, with companies like Huawei gaining market share. He mentioned that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market has significantly decreased from nearly 95% to 50%. China has criticized the US measures as discriminatory and harmful to bilateral trade relations, vowing to take firm steps to protect its interests. </p>

          <p>During a Senate hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus as the president's right to remove people from the country, prompting correction from Senator Maggie Hassan. The New York Times article explains that habeas corpus is a constitutional right that protects individuals from unlawful detention by requiring the government to provide a valid legal basis for holding someone. The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus for immigrants, but legal experts argue that only Congress has the authority to do so. The article provides historical context, noting that habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in American history, most recently after the attack on Pearl Harbor. </p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its "retention scheme" that would have paid significant bonuses to senior executives, following criticism from the government and the public. The scheme, potentially worth up to £1 million per executive, was linked to securing a £3 billion rescue loan for the troubled company. Downing Street stated that rewarding executives for mismanagement was unacceptable. The company will await guidance from Ofwat, the regulator, to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations and turnaround objectives, as Thames Water has faced heavy criticism for sewage discharges and leaks. </p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after making a controversial remark about not buying rice because he received it as gifts from supporters, which was seen as insensitive given rising rice prices. The comment came at a sensitive time as the public struggles with record-high prices for the staple food, causing political fallout for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government ahead of a crucial national election. Eto clarified that he does buy white rice and that his comment referred to brown rice, which he wants people to consider.

Health experts warn that these pouches, often called "snus" by teenagers, are addictive and may have harmful side effects. There are concerns that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes could lead more young people to turn to these stronger nicotine products, which are largely unregulated. Some young people report using up to 15 pouches a day, and while retailers claim to have age restrictions, teens say they can easily purchase them. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that high-dose radiotherapy, while effective at targeting cancer cells, may paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre discovered that radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly exposed to radiation. The groundbreaking work was led by biochemist Yang Kaiting, now a professor at South China University of Technology's school of biomedical sciences and engineering. This finding suggests a need for caution and further research in the application of radiotherapy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease will be available in the US starting in late June, following regulatory clearance. Developed by Japanese company Fujirebio Holdings, the test will initially be available at about 50 American research institutes and hospitals specializing in Alzheimer's. It is designed to detect amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, in individuals at least 55 years old exhibiting signs of the disease. The test is expected to be more accessible and less expensive than PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially speeding up the rollout of new Alzheimer's treatments. </p>

The anti-sanctions law, passed in 2021, stipulates that anyone implementing or assisting sanctions against China is subject to prosecution and liable to pay compensation for losses incurred.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with fires overtaking land clearances from agriculture as the main cause. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests were lost, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon region was particularly affected by record drought conditions, leading to uncontrolled fires. South East Asia bucked the trend with reduced forest loss due to government policies and community efforts. The UN climate summit COP30 will be critical for promoting forest protection schemes, such as rewarding countries for maintaining tropical forests. </p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled plans for his "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, promising to complete the project by the end of his term, despite logistical and financial hurdles. Administration officials claim the system is necessary to protect against catastrophic attacks, but experts question its feasibility and cost, with estimates ranging from $161 billion to $542 billion. Trump stated the project would receive $25 billion from his tax cut and spending bill, and that Canada might participate. The Golden Dome aims to intercept missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space. </p>

This policy shift could undermine Malaysia's plans to become a hub for chip design and cutting-edge manufacturing.

          <p>A new report indicates that record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with fires primarily sparked by human activity. While the underlying cause is climate change, the world has entered a new amplifying phase where fires are more intense. However, Indonesia and Malaysia saw decreases in forest loss due to prevention efforts and stricter laws.

          <p>This Guardian article argues that media attention on young men supposedly driving the rise of the far right is misplaced. While a gender gap exists in support for far-right parties, the more significant trend is a sharp leftward shift among young women. Centre-left parties should focus on the priorities of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, rather than catering to reactionary politics. This strategy could transform political debate and encourage greater participation from young women, who often abstain from voting more than young men. </p>

This is because workers are increasingly seeking a more balanced lifestyle away from China's major coastal cities. Chengdu has earned the reputation of being "China's happiest city" and its appeal reflects a budding disillusionment among young people. With an influx of transplants and returnees, housing prices in Chengdu have increased at a faster rate than in any other major city in China. </p>
