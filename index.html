          <p>A horrific shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in south Minneapolis during a morning Mass claimed the lives of two children, aged 8 and 10, and injured 17 others, including 14 children and three adults in their 80s. The 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, fired through church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, with a motive still under investigation. This deliberate act of violence, occurring on the first day of school, triggered a massive law enforcement response and left the community in shock, prompting calls for action beyond "thoughts and prayers" from city and state leaders. Many victims arrived at hospitals in critical condition, though all injured are now expected to survive, highlighting the heroism of staff who protected children during the nightmare event.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of Victory Day approaches, marking the end of WWII and the Sino-Japanese war, an article examines China's evolving role in the global post-war order. Despite an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties as a key Allied power, China now finds itself increasingly perceived as a revisionist force alongside Russia, challenging the Western-dominated security architecture. Beijing, however, aims to assert its position as a defender of global norms, with President Xi Jinping likely to use the anniversary as a platform to underscore the country's historical sacrifices as a foundation for its commitment to upholding international stability. The article explores how China's past contributions underpin its current determination to maintain global order amidst changing geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal second quarter, forecasting continued sales growth above 50% and signaling robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite this, the stock saw a slight decline in extended trading, attributed to data center revenue falling just short of estimates for the second consecutive period. The company's finance chief projects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030, though H20 chip shipments to China remain uncertain due to geopolitical factors. Nvidia also announced an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, highlighting its strong overall performance driven by its data center and gaming divisions, even as growth slightly slowed compared to previous quarters.

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's tragic death is being commemorated with a train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing his fateful 1955 journey. Organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center and National Parks Conservation Association, the event includes Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old, was brutally lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman, and his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral in Chicago galvanized the modern Civil Rights Movement.

          <p>Kinloch Castle, a grand Victorian hunting lodge on Scotland's Isle of Rum, is back on the market for offers exceeding £750,000, following the collapse of a previous potential sale. The historic property, owned by Scottish government agency NatureScot, is currently in a poor state of repair and requires extensive restoration. The island's small community, comprising around 40 residents, largely supports the sale for redevelopment but emphasizes the need for active community involvement and respect for land access rights from any prospective buyer. This unique opportunity seeks a buyer committed to not only restoring the iconic building and its grounds but also contributing to the nature, sustainability, culture, and economy of the Isle of Rum.</p>

Padilla, who has a long history of public service in California, emphasized the importance of this redistricting effort, framing it as crucial for preventing a "rigged system" that could undermine democratic processes and allow for budget cuts to vital programs.

Sheinbaum vowed to prosecute any officials found to be on cartel payrolls, while critics question the government's actions against alleged "narco-politicians."

          <p>The leaders of an Inland Empire religious group, Pastor Darryl Muzic Martin and his wife Shelly Bailey "Kat" Martin, have been arrested on suspicion of illegal weapons possession, as police investigate the disappearance of two former members. Emilio Ghanem vanished in May 2023 after leaving the "His Way Spirit Led Assemblies" and starting a rival pest control company, with authorities now investigating his case as a potential homicide. Police also reopened the 2017 disappearance of Ruben Moreno, another individual associated with the group. During search warrants, automatic weapons and ghost guns were seized, highlighting serious criminal concerns surrounding the organization and its leadership.</p>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for potential rainfall, thunderstorms, and dangerous surf later this week due to the weakening remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette, moving north off the coast of Mexico. While no official hazard alerts have been issued, forecasters predict increasing moisture, scattered showers, and a slight chance of thunderstorms, particularly in the Riverside and San Bernardino county mountains where flash flooding is possible. The system is expected to dissipate by Thursday, but its effects will still impact surf conditions, increasing the likelihood of dangerous rip currents. Residents are advised to prepare for unusual weather for this time of year, with the bulk of tropical moisture staying south and east of Los Angeles County.</p>

          <p>U.S. universities are reporting a significant drop in international student enrollment for the fall semester, with institutions like the University at Buffalo seeing hundreds fewer than expected. This decline is largely attributed to stricter Trump Administration policies on student visas, which have caused long delays and increased scrutiny, leading many accepted students to defer or transfer to other countries. The Association of International Educators predicts a 15% overall drop, potentially costing the U.S. economy billions and impacting innovation. While President Trump has sent mixed signals on the issue, the decrease raises concerns about the financial and cultural contributions international students bring to American campuses.</p>

It also emphasizes the importance of determining an affordable deposit amount to avoid early withdrawal penalties, and seeking the longest-term CD that fits one's budget to benefit from extended interest-earning potential.

          <p>A new lawsuit filed against the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans and its top officials alleges Archbishop Gregory Aymond personally concealed child sexual assault by priests and deacons. The suit, brought by bond trustee Argent Institutional Trust Co., claims Aymond and other church affiliates hid the extent of abuse before investors purchased $41 million in church bond debt in 2017. The allegations are supported by reports highlighting discrepancies in lists of credibly accused clergy and evidence of a long history of abuse. The lawsuit seeks to ensure bondholders are paid in full before priests receive retirement benefits, challenging the proposed bankruptcy settlement that guarantees pensions for non-abusing clergy.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering additional financing may find a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to be a strategic option this September, given favorable market conditions. HELOCs currently offer lower interest rates compared to home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards, making them one of the most affordable borrowing methods. Furthermore, the variable interest rates of HELOCs could potentially decline further if the anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut in September materializes. With home equity levels reaching record highs in many regions, homeowners have a substantial funding source to tap into.

The indictment also alleges he used investor money for luxury expenses, including hotel stays, clothing, art classes, and his wedding.

This reversal comes despite warnings from councils and charities about increased refugee homelessness, with many organizations reporting the longer period had been effective. While families, pregnant women, and disabled individuals will retain the 56-day period until December, charities are "appalled" by the broader decision, arguing it will strain local authorities and lead to more homelessness among new refugees.
