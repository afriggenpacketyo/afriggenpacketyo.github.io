          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction, according to the Office for National Statistics. This downturn contrasts with economists' predictions of a 0.1% growth for the month. The decline in economic output was primarily attributed to a significant drop in the production sector. These figures raise concerns about the overall health and trajectory of the UK's economy amid ongoing global pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing over Novak Djokovic's fitness ahead of his Wimbledon semi-final match against world number one Jannik Sinner. Djokovic, who had an awkward fall in his quarter-final, canceled a scheduled practice session on Thursday. Sinner is also managing an elbow injury, adding another layer of uncertainty to the highly anticipated matchup. Given Djokovic's age and recent injury history, his physical condition remains a key variable for the upcoming high-stakes game.</p>

          <p>The OPEC international seminar took place at Vienna's Hofburg palace, bringing together energy ministers and top CEOs to discuss the oil market, investments, and the green energy transition. The event, marked by a lavish setting, was led by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. However, the conference also drew protests from demonstrators who gathered nearby, calling for an oil embargo in solidarity with Gaza. The seminar provided a rare opportunity for in-person briefings as OPEC+ has increasingly held meetings via videoconference.</p>

          <p>A significant confrontation occurred in Ventura County, California, when U.S. Border Patrol agents executed a warrant at a marijuana facility, leading to clashes with protesters. Agents deployed tear gas and less-lethal rounds to control the crowd, while some protesters reportedly threw rocks at federal vehicles. The raid sparked a political dispute, with Governor Gavin Newsom condemning the action, while federal officials reported finding unaccompanied minors at the site, raising child labor concerns. Several injuries were reported, and multiple people were taken to the hospital.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a new 35% tariff on all imports from Canada, set to begin on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump linked the tariff to Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and cited trade deficits as a national security threat. He warned that any retaliatory tariffs from Ottawa would result in even higher U.S. duties. The move escalates trade tensions despite ongoing negotiations between the two closely linked economies.

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off approximately 1,800 domestic employees, reducing its U.S.-based workforce by about 15%. This move is part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration aimed at streamlining operations and cutting what it calls a "bloated bureaucracy." The plan also involves closing or merging numerous domestic offices and integrating the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) into the State Department. Critics, including the American Foreign Service Association, argue the cuts could demoralize the workforce and undermine American diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A resident of Jaffa has been collecting and selling aluminum scrap from buildings destroyed during a recent Iranian missile attack, earning thousands of shekels daily. While displaced families await compensation, the man, identified as S., gathers materials like window frames and doors from the wreckage in Tel Aviv and surrounding areas. He defends his actions, stating he only takes items from abandoned sites and that it is a "good way to make a living." The article highlights a peculiar and opportunistic response to the widespread devastation caused by the attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Audit Office (NAO) has found that Britain's F-35 stealth jet program is being undermined by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages, delivering a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion spent so far. While the F-35 is technologically superior, its full mission capability rate is only about one-third of the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) target. The NAO also estimated the final cost to expand the fleet will be significantly higher than MoD forecasts. The MoD responded that the program is within budget and two full squadrons will be ready by year's end.</p>

The findings are based on a new probe launched after civil war re-erupted in April 2023.

          <p>China is experiencing a rapid increase in the adoption of electric-powered heavy trucks, with sales estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year. This boom, driven by government subsidies and a fast-growing charging network, is significantly curbing the nation's diesel consumption and overall oil demand. The shift is so pronounced that some analysts have revised their forecasts, now predicting that China's oil demand may have already peaked. The lower operating costs of electric trucks are making them an increasingly attractive option for commercial use. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump and other administration officials have consistently maintained that the strikes were a total success.

          <p>A recent survey indicates that the United States is becoming a less attractive travel destination for many Southeast Asians, with nearly 80% reporting a decline in its appeal. Respondents cited concerns over potential discrimination, the actions of the Trump administration, and gun violence as primary deterrents, weighing more heavily than costs. While travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines showed continued interest, likely due to strong diaspora ties, a majority of Singaporeans expressed less interest in visiting.
