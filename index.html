          <h2>Deadly Mall Fire in Iraq Claims Over 60 Lives</h2>

          <p>A catastrophic fire at a newly opened mall in Kut, Wasit province, Iraq, claimed the lives of 61 individuals, mostly due to suffocation. The tragic incident, which erupted late Wednesday, led to the provincial governor declaring three days of mourning across the region. Rescue efforts successfully saved over 45 people, though some are still unaccounted for, and 14 charred bodies remain unidentified. An investigation into the fire's cause is underway, with legal cases initiated against the building and mall owners, drawing attention to the persistent issue of inadequate building standards in Iraq that have contributed to past disasters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's labor market is experiencing a significant slowdown, marked by an increase in the unemployment rate to a four-year high of 4.7% and a deceleration in annual pay growth to 5%. Official statistics from the Office for National Statistics also indicate a continuous three-year decline in job vacancies, reaching their lowest point in a decade, excluding the pandemic's impact. This weakening trend is prompting economists to suggest that the Bank of England may implement interest rate cuts next month to bolster the economy. However, concerns persist among some experts regarding potential inflationary pressures if spending is encouraged prematurely.</p>

          <h2>TSMC Reports Record Profit Driven by Strong AI Chip Demand</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported a record 61% surge in second-quarter profit, exceeding estimates, primarily fueled by robust demand for AI chips. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer projects a 30% revenue increase for 2025, buoyed by AI and advanced technology adoption. While AI demand is highly sustainable, the company faces potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and export controls on China. Despite these uncertainties, TSMC's high-performance computing division, including AI and 5G, now contributes 60% of its revenue, underscoring its pivotal role in the AI boom.

          <p>Volvo Cars' shares surged over 10% after its second-quarter operating profit surpassed analyst expectations, despite a significant year-on-year decline. The automaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, reported a drop in profit and revenue, attributing it to a challenging industry environment and a substantial impairment charge. To adapt to U.S. tariffs, Volvo plans to add its best-selling XC60 SUV to its South Carolina production line by late 2026 and is reducing sedans and station wagons from its U.S. portfolio. CEO Håkan Samuelsson affirmed the company's commitment to the U.S. market, emphasizing increased factory utilization. (not investment advice)</p>

Biegun indicated that Chinese officials recognize the need to "pay a certain price" to balance the trade relationship, aligning with the U.S. President's focus on trade balance as a key metric.

          <p>Tom Lynagh will start at fly-half for Australia in Saturday's first Test against the British and Irish Lions, emulating his father, Michael Lynagh, who played in the 1989 series. This marks the 22-year-old's first international start, stepping in for Noah Lolesio. Head coach Joe Schmidt also named Nick Champion de Crespigny for a debut on the flank and Harry Wilson as captain. Despite key forwards missing due to injury, Schmidt backed Lynagh to thrive in the high-stakes environment at Suncorp Stadium, a venue with a strong home record for Australia, providing a boost of confidence for the Wallabies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has expressed his desire to sell more advanced chips to China, beyond the current H20 model, following the lifting of a previous ban on the less-advanced AI chip. Huang stated his hope that permissible chip technology for China will continuously improve, referencing Nvidia's Hopper architecture. Nvidia has been navigating U.S.-China trade tensions, developing compliant semiconductors and taking a $4.5 billion writedown on unsold H20 inventory. Huang emphasizes the significant potential of the Chinese AI market, estimated at $50 billion, and argues against American firms being excluded, while also acknowledging the disruptive nature of export controls.

          <p>The White House announced that the national fentanyl overdose prevention grant program, Overdose Data To Action (OD2A), will be funded "in increments" rather than a single annual payment, despite a $140 million shortfall. This shift has raised significant concerns among CDC staffers and public health officials, who fear potential layoffs and program shutdowns due to funding uncertainty. While the administration asserts its commitment to combating the fentanyl epidemic, state and local health departments report a lack of clear communication and have begun pausing spending. Critics point to a pattern of the Trump administration withholding or clawing back public health funds.</p>

          <p>U.S. air traffic controllers are skeptical that the Trump administration's $12.5 billion plan to modernize equipment will resolve deeper, long-standing issues within the system. Despite recent mid-air collisions and radar outages highlighting problems, controllers argue the plan overlooks critical concerns such as severe staffing shortages, mandatory overtime, and stagnant pay. Many work six-day weeks under immense stress, feeling their quality-of-life issues are ignored. While the FAA aims to boost recruitment and training, controllers contend that without addressing compensation and work-life balance, morale will remain low, impacting the safety and efficiency of air travel.</p>

This flat-top vessel, with hull number 51, is designed to revolutionize sea-to-land assaults by integrating fixed-wing drones, fighters, and helicopters, along with traditional landing craft. Spotted on satellite images in 2023, the ship is currently undergoing equipment and sea trials and is expected to be commissioned by the People’s Liberation Army by late 2026. The Sichuan will serve as a crucial fleet command center, enhancing China's power projection and amphibious warfare capacity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the revocation of $4 billion in federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, labeling it an "ill-conceived and unnecessary project" and a "total waste of Taxpayer money." U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed this sentiment, calling it a "boondoggle." California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have denounced the action as unlawful and are exploring all legal options to fight it, asserting that the state has met all obligations for the project. This decision, if upheld, would severely impact the long-delayed and over-budget project, which aims to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

Over 1,350 domestic staffers were cut as part of a reorganization effort, which critics argue was arbitrary and poorly executed, damaging foreign relations. Employees reported chaotic dismissals, with some laid off while on official travel and others from critical departments like passport fraud investigations. The cuts included the entire Office of Casualty Assistance and analysts from the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, prompting former officials to warn of weakened diplomatic capabilities.</p>

Despite the late-night passage of debate rules, the struggle has disappointed the crypto industry, which had hoped for a clear regulatory framework during "Crypto Week."

Seven & i, which had previously rejected a lower bid, countered by calling Couche-Tard's termination "unilateral" and its statements "inaccurate." Analysts suggest that Japanese protectionism likely played a role, making it difficult for the deal to succeed given Seven & i's status as a "core" national security company.
