          <h2>Liberal Party Projected to Win Canadian Election Amid Trump's Influence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 04:50:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, is projected to win the federal election, avoiding a Conservative takeover that polls suggested was likely just months ago. The election was heavily influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to annex Canada and his imposition of tariffs, which resonated strongly with voters concerned about Canadian sovereignty and economic stability. Carney, who succeeded Justin Trudeau in March, emphasized the need for Canada to stand up to Trump's policies and forge its own path. The Liberal win indicates a significant shift in Canadian sentiment, prioritizing unity and independence in the face of external pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Victoria McCloud, the UK's only openly transgender former judge, plans to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex at the European Court of Human Rights. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law, leading to interim guidance that could restrict trans women's access to women's facilities. McCloud argues that the court failed to consider human rights arguments and that the ruling has left her in a legal paradox of being "two sexes at once." She asserts that trans people were excluded from the court case and that the ruling violates her fundamental human rights, advocating for a legal definition of a woman based on birth certificate gender markers.</p>

          <p>Japan and the Philippines are set to initiate discussions on critical security pacts to bolster their defense cooperation, particularly in light of China's increasing maritime activities. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. are expected to confirm joint coast guard drills and exchange views on the global economy amid U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The focus is on establishing an intelligence-sharing pact and a bilateral acquisition and cross-servicing agreement to enhance defense supplies and logistical support.

          <p>Young voters in Australia, now outnumbering baby boomers, are prepared to express their dissatisfaction with climate inaction in the upcoming election. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition is advocating for a 75% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2035, significantly ahead of the government's current targets. While the incumbent center-left Labor government promotes clean energy, it has faced criticism for approving new fossil fuel projects. This election could see a surge in support for minor parties like the Greens and Teal independents, reflecting a broader disillusionment with major parties' climate policies.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers have agreed on a budget deal that includes an additional criminal charge for individuals who wear masks while committing crimes. This measure aims to address concerns about people concealing their identities while engaging in illegal activities, especially during protests. The extra charge will apply to those charged with a class A misdemeanor or more serious offenses, with a reduced penalty for separate crimes. The budget also includes provisions for involuntary commitment of mentally ill individuals who cannot meet their basic needs and a ban on student cell phone use during the school day.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is advocating for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms, addressing critical staff shortages in the field. Currently, breast screenings are exclusively conducted by female staff. While some women express concerns about privacy and dignity, others like breast cancer survivor Sally Reed, emphasize that life-saving procedures should be accessible regardless of the practitioner's gender. The proposal aims to broaden the pool of qualified professionals and ensure timely access to breast cancer screenings amid rising vacancy rates among mammographers.</p>

          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes. This move aims to address obesity by reducing sugar consumption, particularly among children. The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included due to concerns about calcium intake, but the government now believes the health benefits do not outweigh the harms from excess sugar. The government also proposes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before they are subject to the levy, from 5g to 4g per 100ml.</p>

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley predict that the US and China will engage in negotiations to gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports, despite conflicting statements from both nations. While trade disruptions may lead to talks, tariffs are unlikely to return to pre-January 2025 levels. More comprehensive discussions in the second half of the year could further reduce tariffs, reflecting the removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariff. However, the damage already inflicted on the economic cycle suggests that overall growth is expected to remain downward. (not investment advice)</p>

The company announced a dividend and share buyback, but faces pressure from activist investors like Elliott Management. BP's underperformance has also positioned it as a potential takeover candidate.
