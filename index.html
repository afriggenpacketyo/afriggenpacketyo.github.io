          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following President Trump's suggestion of an impending agreement between the U.S. and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program, leading to speculation about increased oil exports from Iran. The article cites analysts who believe that a deal could potentially add one million barrels per day to the global oil supply, although OPEC+ might adjust its production plans in response. The article also provides background on Iran's economic struggles since the U.S. withdrew from the original nuclear deal in 2018, including protests, currency devaluation, and regional conflicts.

          <p>An interim report reveals that the crew of the Bayesian, a luxury superyacht that sank off Sicily, lacked awareness of the wind speeds necessary to capsize the vessel, leading to the deaths of seven people, including tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter. The report details that winds exceeding 73 mph could have tipped the yacht, but this information was absent from the onboard stability manual. The investigation also showed the yacht was attempting to shelter from a storm when it was violently hit by winds over 80 mph, causing it to capsize within seconds. The MAIB continues its investigation, facing challenges due to an ongoing Italian criminal investigation and the death of a diver involved in raising the wreck.</p>

Trump emphasized his preference for Apple to build its products in the U.S., referencing Apple's $500 billion investment commitment. Apple has been actively shifting production to India to reduce reliance on China, aiming to manufacture around 25% of global iPhones in India within a few years. Trump told Cook that the U.S. has tolerated Apple's plants in China for years, but now expects the company to prioritize domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the UK economy is showing signs of recovery, with growth exceeding expectations in the first quarter of the year. The 0.7% growth was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts cautioned that this strong growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Reeves acknowledged the ongoing cost of living crisis but highlighted the UK's potential to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7 for the first three months of the year.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins is in Britain to advocate for increased access for American agricultural products, following a recent agreement to lower tariffs. Rollins aims to counter the perception that American meat is substandard and push for more access for products like pork, poultry, seafood, and rice. The article highlights the challenges of aligning British food standards with American practices and the skepticism among British consumers. It also discusses the potential benefits and limitations of the trade agreement for American farmers.</p>

          <p>With retailers slowing down orders for foreign goods due to tariffs, companies that recirculate overstocked or returned items are expected to see increased demand. ReturnPro, a reverse logistics company, handles millions of dollars' worth of returned goods from major retailers, sorting, cleaning, and repackaging them for resale. The article notes that as inventories decline due to fewer goods crossing the Pacific, retailers may turn to companies like ReturnPro as an alternative.

          <p>Senator John Kennedy argues that the Supreme Court should use the opportunity presented by a series of cases to eliminate the practice of universal injunctions, which allow individual district court judges to halt federal government policies nationwide. Kennedy contends that this practice gives judges extraordinary power not authorized by the Constitution or Congress. He also argues that universal injunctions force the Supreme Court to rush decisions on complex legal issues, undermining the judicial process. The senator emphasizes that this is not an ideological or partisan issue, as justices from across the spectrum have expressed concerns about universal injunctions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants. The legal challenge is focused on the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against presidential orders. Legal experts say that the president does not have the power to end birthright citizenship because it is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The outcome could significantly impact Trump's ability to implement his agenda without congressional approval.</p>
