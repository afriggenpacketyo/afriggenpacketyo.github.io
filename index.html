          <h2>China Develops Stealth Technology for Early Warning Aircraft</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 00:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly made a significant breakthrough in developing stealth technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, traditionally vulnerable command nodes. This innovative method, utilizing frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, making radar emissions exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. This renders the signal chaotic and difficult for adversaries to track, behaving like a "phantom" beyond recognition. Engineers describe this as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability and operational effectiveness of these crucial military assets and significantly impacting future aerial warfare strategies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared he had fired Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, an action Cook vehemently denies. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, asserted Trump lacks the legal authority to terminate her "for cause" and confirmed she would not resign, hiring high-profile attorney Abbe Lowell. This unprecedented move marks a dramatic escalation of Trump's attacks on the U.S. central bank's independence, potentially leading to a federal court challenge and Supreme Court review. The incident introduces significant uncertainty for markets and future monetary policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

These deals, announced during a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Lee Jae Myung, build upon a prior trade agreement that reduced U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports. The leaders also committed to energy cooperation, including developing Alaska's natural gas reserves, and reaffirmed their dedication to regional security.

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams delivered a courageous performance in her US Open return, engaging 11th seed Karolína Muchová in an intense two-hour battle before ultimately falling 6-3, 2-6, 6-1. The 45-year-old's appearance coincided with the 28th anniversary of her US Open debut on Arthur Ashe Stadium, where she showcased her formidable serve and attacking style. Williams expressed pride in her improved physical condition, attributing her inability to maintain peak form to a lack of recent match practice. Her return was particularly meaningful after undergoing surgery for fibroids, allowing her to compete without the significant pain she had experienced previously.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor's shares tumbled over 6% in Tokyo after Mercedes-Benz announced plans to offload its 3.8% holding in the Japanese automaker, a stake valued at approximately $346 million. A Mercedes-Benz spokesperson stated that the Nissan holdings, moved into pension assets in 2016, were not strategically significant and the sale is part of a portfolio cleanup. This divestment exacerbates pressure on Nissan's stock, which has already been impacted by U.S. tariffs, declining sales, and intense global competition in the electric vehicle market. The company recently embarked on a major restructuring, including 11,000 job cuts and seven plant closures, further highlighting its challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Republican-led congressional committee has significantly expanded its investigations into alleged antisemitism within the University of California system, now targeting UCLA and UC San Francisco medical schools. The committee has demanded years of internal documents, citing reports of Jewish individuals experiencing hostility and concerns over inadequate university responses, potentially violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. This action follows the Trump administration's suspension of over $500 million in grants to UCLA due to similar allegations. The probe also seeks communications related to a task force report alleging anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim, and anti-Arab racism on campus, intensifying the complex and contentious climate at these institutions.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its colossal Super Heavy-Starship rocket, initially due to an oxygen leak in a ground system and subsequently because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This milestone mission is crucial for demonstrating fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year, aiming to clear the path for a faster launch cadence. SpaceX is preparing for autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a critical requirement for NASA's Artemis moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual Mars missions.

Opponents argue the plan violates the state constitution by bypassing an independent redistricting commission and redrawing maps mid-decade.

          <p>President Donald Trump has vowed to impose "substantial" new tariffs and restrict U.S. chip exports on all countries that do not eliminate their digital services taxes (DSTs). Trump asserted on Truth Social that these taxes, currently implemented by dozens of nations, are deliberately designed to harm or discriminate against American technology companies. He warned that unless these "discriminatory actions" are removed, the U.S. would retaliate with significant additional tariffs on those countries' exports and institute export restrictions on highly protected U.S. technology and chips. This policy reflects Trump's long-standing pressure on trade partners to drop such levies, which have previously led to contentious trade disputes, as exemplified by Canada's recent rescission of its DST.

The curriculum offers flexibility in delivery, allowing schools to integrate AI content into existing subjects like information technology and science, or to dedicate specific weeks to concentrated lessons. Advanced studies and hands-on projects will be available for interested students, while basic AI concepts and responsible use, including privacy, will be introduced to younger children. This strategic educational reform aims to prepare a future workforce for an AI-driven economy and solidify China's leadership in technological innovation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding for U.S. schools, reversing an earlier freeze after a multi-state lawsuit challenged the decision. These funds, which support crucial programs like after-school and summer learning, teacher training, and assistance for English-learners, were withheld without a clear official explanation, though the White House cited alleged "misuse" for a "radical left-wing agenda." California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the agreement, emphasizing that states accused the administration of illegally impounding congressionally allocated funds. The restoration provides significant relief to programs benefiting approximately 1.4 million children nationwide, many from low-income families, who faced considerable uncertainty due to the funding freeze.</p>
