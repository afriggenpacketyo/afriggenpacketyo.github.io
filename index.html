            <p>China's first-quarter GDP surpassed estimates, growing by 5.4% year-on-year, driven by strong retail sales and industrial output. This growth occurred amidst escalating trade tensions with the U.S., prompting several investment banks to reduce China's annual growth outlook. Despite the positive start, concerns remain about achieving the ambitious annual growth target of around 5% due to the potential impact of increasing tariffs. Chinese officials face pressure to implement more robust stimulus measures to bolster domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion impact after the U.S. government tightened export rules to China, requiring licenses for its H20 AI chip sales. The new rules, part of an escalating trade war, aim to prevent the covered products from being used in supercomputers in China. Analysts suggest this may be a negotiating tactic, with potential exemptions or changes to tariff policy in the near future. The move could lead to a fully decoupled US and China AI semiconductor supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>
