          <p>A sweeping US tax and spending bill has advanced through a key House committee, overcoming initial Republican conflict. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from President Trump's first term, end taxes on tips, and increase military and border spending, funded partly by cuts to Medicaid and green subsidies. Despite the bill's progress, divisions remain within the Republican Party, with some conservatives seeking deeper cuts and moderates objecting to provisions on local tax deductions. Analysts suggest the bill could add trillions to the national debt, raising concerns about its long-term fiscal impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a recent truce in the trade war, tensions between the United States and China have resurfaced, casting doubt on any lasting de-escalation. The US imposed a global ban on Huawei Technologies' Ascend AI chips, citing export control violations and national security concerns. Beijing responded by accusing Washington of "maliciously blockading and suppressing Chinese chip products and the AI industry." Analysts suggest President Trump aims to expand the battleground beyond tariffs, tightening tech restrictions on China.

American Oversight argues that these documents could reveal potential political interference by the president in agency operations.

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw centrists holding off hard-right breakthroughs, though discontent with mainstream parties persists. In Romania, Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, defeated George Simion, a hard-line nationalist aligned with Trump. Poland's election was less decisive, with Rafal Trzaskowski, a liberal mayor, securing a narrow lead over Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian, setting up a runoff. The big shock in Poland was the 6.3 percent won by Grzegorz Braun, a nationalist firebrand known for anti-Semitic stunts. These elections highlight the fragmentation of political movements and growing dissatisfaction with established parties.</p>

The sale of some British meat products in the European Union will be possible again and some border checks on animal and plant products will end. This agreement includes plans for a new program to allow young Europeans to travel and work in Britain and vice versa.</p>

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting the leadership of the European Union (EU) at a summit in London, and has inked agreements calling for deepening defense and trade ties. An agreement on fisheries allows EU fishermen to have access to British waters for an extended period of 12 years in exchange for the EU indefinitely easing red tape on food and drink imports and exports. The eased customs checks on food and plant products are expected to add "nearly 9 billion pounds" ($12 billion/â‚¬10.7 billion) to the British economy by 2040.</p>

          <p>Stock futures declined before the opening bell Monday after the U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday. Moody's forecast that federal deficits will widen to almost 9% of the U.S. economy by 2035, driven mostly by higher interest payments on debt, growing entitlement spending and low revenue generation from taxes. Moody's decision was "hardly surprising," said Adam Crisafulli, equities analyst and head of Vital Knowledge, in a research note. In addition to reflecting tariff concerns, Moody's downgrade also highlighted apprehension that the reconciliation bill in Congress, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill" by President Trump, could further fuel U.S. debt.

          <p>President Trumpâ€™s tariffs on auto parts are already causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, the heart of an industry that makes components for vehicles bound for the United States. Many parts makers are small businesses without the financial cushion that auto giants can lean on to soften the blow from the 25 percent tariffs Mr. Trump applied to imported autos and some auto parts. Flavio Volpe, the president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturersâ€™ Association, estimates that upward of 12,000 parts workers have been laid off and, in some cases, recalled since the start of U.S. tariffs. While tariffs are threatening Canadaâ€™s vital auto industry, levies once played a role in its creation.</p>
