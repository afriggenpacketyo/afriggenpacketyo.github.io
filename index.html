          <p>Samsung Electronics reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by robust sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips, resulting in a record quarterly revenue increase of 10% year-over-year and a 1.5% rise in operating profit. The company acknowledged macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and global growth slowdown but anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year, contingent on diminishing uncertainties. Samsung remains a leading manufacturer of memory chips and the world's second-largest smartphone maker, navigating a complex global economic landscape while maintaining strong sales momentum.

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber issued an apology after internal reports revealed instances of antisemitic and anti-Muslim prejudice on campus, which were investigated following pro-Palestinian protests related to the Israel-Gaza conflict. The reports highlighted student experiences of alienation and pressure to conceal their identities, prompting Harvard to pledge a review of its academic offerings and admissions policies. While Harvard aims to ensure applicants are evaluated based on their ability to engage constructively with diverse perspectives, the proposed remedial actions may fall short of demands for merit-based policies, as the university faces scrutiny and legal challenges regarding its admissions practices. The president himself, who is Jewish, mentioned personally experiencing antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Mexico's top prosecutor stated that a ranch initially believed to be an "extermination camp" used for human cremations was actually a training and recruitment center for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, based on testimonials and documents. Attorney General Alejandro Gertz insisted there is no evidence of cremations at the ranch, contradicting earlier comments about traces of cremation on human remains. HÃ©ctor Flores, a leader of a search group, maintains the belief that the ranch was an extermination site, accusing officials of manipulating the narrative. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to identify bone fragments found at the site, while acknowledging that local authorities failed to secure the ranch after its initial discovery.</p>

          <p>Despite the White House framing President Trump's tariffs policy as the end of "the era of economic surrender," official press releases marking his 100th day in office barely mentioned tariffs, instead emphasizing job growth, investment, inflation, and regulatory cuts. While Trump claimed countries, including China, were seeking trade deals to avoid tariffs, China has denied any ongoing trade talks with the U.S. Trump described tariffs as a historic effort to curb job theft, but also suggested that tensions around tariffs did not preclude reaching a deal with China, creating a complex and sometimes contradictory narrative around the administration's trade policies.</p>

In previous talks, the U.S. expressed dissatisfaction with the number of U.S.-made cars imported into Japan and pushed for greater access for U.S. agricultural products. Japan is considering proposing increased imports of U.S.-grown soybeans and corn and allowing more imported cars to qualify for simplified safety and environmental screening to encourage Washington to review the tariffs, navigating complex trade relations amidst heightened global trade friction.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors for the Southern District of New York denied allegations of eavesdropping on calls between Luigi Mangione and his lawyer, Karen Agnifilo, explaining that recorded calls were mistakenly sent to them by the Metropolitan Detention Center. According to prosecutors, Mangione spoke to his attorney on a monitored line instead of a designated attorney line, leading to the inadvertent recording and transmission of the calls. Prosecutors assert that no member of the federal prosecution team listened to any attorney call and have segregated all recordings to prevent further access. Mangione faces state and federal charges in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson and has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations, with significant price rises in housing, education, and food, partially offset by falls in recreation and household goods. The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut rates to 4.1% from 4.35% due to the softening inflation. The RBA expects growth in Australia's economy to pick up and the labor market to remain strong, although global uncertainties persist. This release comes as Australia prepares for an election, with the Labor Party currently holding a lead over the Liberal-National opposition.</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded, stating that President Trump has delivered on hundreds of promises, secured the border, and is ending inflation.

          <p>President Trump eased the impact of his new 25 percent tariffs on the auto industry, allowing automakers producing vehicles in the United States to claim reimbursements over the next two years, aiming to help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts. Under the relief, manufacturers can offset 15 percent of the suggested retail price of a U.S.-assembled automobile in the first year and 10 percent in the second year, with the offset arrangement stopping thereafter. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the United States is close to a tariff deal with India, while major U.S. trading partners in Asia, including Japan and South Korea, have been forthcoming in aiming for deals.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated his 100th day in office with a campaign-style speech in Michigan, highlighting his achievements and targeting political opponents, hailing what he called a "revolution of common sense." He mocked Joe Biden, criticized the Federal Reserve's chairman, and dismissed polls showing his popularity slipping, while touting a dramatic fall in illegal border crossings. Despite softening tariffs on foreign cars and car parts, Trump emphasized that car firms were "lining up" to open new manufacturing plants in Michigan. The Democratic National Committee criticized Trump's first 100 days as a "colossal failure," blaming him for higher costs and a potential recession.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with ABC News, President Trump said he "could" secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man his administration said was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Trump argued that Abrego Garcia is a member of the criminal MS-13 gang, despite his lawyers' claims that he is not and has not been charged with a crime. When pressed about a Supreme Court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Trump maintained that Abrego Garcia came into the country illegally, but conceded that he could call the president of El Salvador to send him back.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration dismissed nearly 400 scientists working on the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, raising concerns about the report's future objectivity and scientific rigor. The move follows plans outlined in Project 2025 to reshape the report and the office that organizes it, the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Critics worry that the administration will proceed with its own report, assigning authors that represent alternative viewpoints on climate change, potentially undermining the report's credibility and the country's status as a premiere data and research center.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Justice has begun criminal prosecutions of migrants for entering a newly declared military buffer zone along the border with Mexico, with at least 28 migrants charged in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The 170-mile-long, 60ft-wide militarized buffer zone is patrolled by active-duty US troops, and the migrants were charged with both crossing the US-Mexico border illegally and entering a restricted area. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico expressed concerns about the enhanced militarization of borderlands communities and the erosion of constitutional principles, as the Trump administration uses troops to arrest migrants without invoking the Insurrection Act.</p>

The judge, Royce C. Lamberth, ordered the administration to pay the news organization $12 million for its April funding, rejecting the assertion that he was dictating administration policy or siding with the news organization out of admiration for its journalistic work. The ruling follows the Trump administration's termination of the grant for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which Judge Lamberth temporarily blocked, stating Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally shut down an organization funded by Congress.</p>

The law is also intended to prevent local authorities from unfairly targeting private businesses, restricting the law enforcement power of the public security department and promoting strict, standardized, fair, and civilized law enforcement.</p>

The power cut also led to an information blackout, making radios essential for staying informed, and power banks for keeping devices charged.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders that walked back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing by raising the cost of production and squeezing their profits. The changes modify Mr. Trumpâs tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over the next two years. Despite these concessions, the administration's policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers.</p>
