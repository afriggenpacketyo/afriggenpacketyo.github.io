          <p>Ahead of China's 80th-anniversary Victory Day parade, academics with official ties are promoting a narrative that downplays the United States' wartime aid and elevates the role of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China. Articles in an official periodical described Soviet support as crucial while accusing the West of trying to erase the USSR's contributions to the anti-fascist struggle. This push to reshape the historical narrative aligns with current geopolitical dynamics, as Russian President Vladimir Putin is a headline guest for the event, highlighting a strengthened Sino-Russian relationship. The commentary represents a significant critique of the Western-centric view of World War II from Chinese institutions.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Notting Hill Carnival has officially begun in west London, starting with the traditional J'ouvert celebration at dawn, where attendees covered the streets in colorful paint and powder. The opening day focused on the children's parade, featuring young musicians and dancers in bright costumes, marking the start of Europe's largest street festival. The annual event, which has been running for over 50 years, celebrates Caribbean culture and heritage. Organizers have also planned a 72-second silence on both days of the carnival to commemorate the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away in recent years.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant address, vowing the nation would continue to fight for its freedom until its calls for a just peace are heard. The celebrations in Kyiv were attended by international allies, including Canada's Prime Minister, who reaffirmed his country's unwavering support. The anniversary was marked by new pledges of military aid, with Norway and Germany jointly funding Patriot air defense systems and the UK extending its training program for Ukrainian soldiers. The day also saw reports of a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's Kursk nuclear power plant, which caused a fire but no radiation leak.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine celebrated its 34th anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union, Russia launched a large-scale overnight attack involving 72 drones and a ballistic missile across the country. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted or suppressed 48 of the drones, but impacts were reported in ten locations. Concurrently, Ukraine conducted its own extensive drone strikes on Russian territory, with Moscow reporting 95 drones downed over 14 regions. A Ukrainian drone reportedly caused a fire at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, damaging a transformer but resulting in no radiation leak, prompting concern from the International Atomic Energy Agency about the safety of nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>The head of Russia's state atomic energy corporation, Rosatom, stated that Moscow faces "colossal threats" and must update its nuclear capabilities to guarantee the nation's sovereignty. The comments come shortly after a summit between President Putin and President Trump, from which little concrete progress on a Ukraine ceasefire emerged. While not specifying the source of the threats, the statement highlights ongoing geopolitical tensions and the precarious state of international arms control. The New Start Treaty, the last remaining bilateral nuclear agreement between the U.S. and Russia, is set to expire in February 2026, with Moscow having already paused its participation in 2023.</p>

          <p>In this opinion article, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy criticizes the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and its withdrawal from global climate leadership, arguing it undermines America's economy and security. McCarthy contends that despite federal inaction, significant progress is being made at the state and local levels, with states like California, Florida, and Texas setting records in clean energy adoption. She highlights that corporations, cities, and investors continue to pursue ambitious climate goals because they recognize the economic and practical benefits of clean energy. McCarthy asserts that this widespread commitment demonstrates that the country's future lies in renewable technologies, regardless of the administration's stance.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the most effective use of current artificial intelligence is not to fully automate jobs, but to collaborate with and augment human expertise. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it explains that imperfect automation can be dangerous, as it may undermine human skills and fail in critical moments. The authors distinguish between automation tools, which replace human input, and collaboration tools, which enhance it. They argue that AI should be designed as a collaborative partner, leveraging its vast data-processing capabilities to complement human strengths like contextual understanding, ethical intuition, and creativity, leading to better outcomes in complex fields like medicine and law.</p>

          <p>Despite growing favorability for socialism among young Americans and Democrats, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) struggles to translate numbers into significant political power. The article argues that the organization is hobbled by a deep internal rift between a pragmatic, mass-politics wing focused on winning elections within the Democratic Party and a sectarian, extremist wing. This latter faction holds anti-democratic and anti-Zionist views that alienate mainstream voters and prominent socialist politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This ideological conflict prevents a unified national strategy, leaving the DSA as a decentralized and often ineffective collection of local chapters rather than a cohesive political force.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author describes the profound experience of reading aloud to her newborn son, beginning with Romantic poetry in the hospital. She explains that this practice became a way to share her love of literature and connect with her child, even before he could understand the words or see the pictures clearly. As her son grew, simple board books helped teach him to discern objects and form words, which the author likens to a form of creation. She concludes that reading to her children was not just about teaching them to read, but was also a powerful tool for her to learn how to read them and understand their developing minds.</p>

Tennis provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density and has been linked to a longer life expectancy compared to other physical activities. The sport also offers substantial cognitive benefits, as it requires complex motor coordination, rapid decision-making, and spatial awareness, which can enhance reaction times and buffer against cognitive decline. Unlike many sports, tennis is accessible to people of all ages, making it an ideal lifetime activity for maintaining both physical and mental fitness.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The First and Last Bank," proposes a novel approach to carbon sequestration by treating excess atmospheric carbon as a valuable, sacred commodity to be hoarded, much like the U.S. government does with gold. The authors envision a grassroots system of community-based carbon banks that would accept organic waste, convert it into stable biochar, and issue a local digital currency to depositors in return. This decentralized model would not require government or corporate buy-in, allowing communities to create their own value systems around carbon removal. The concept aims to incentivize sequestration by pairing a collective environmental mission with modest financial benefits for participants.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, residents and experts reflect on the storm that flooded 80% of the city and caused 1,400 deaths. The disaster was long predicted, with scientific models and even a FEMA simulation exercise in 2004 showing that the city's levee system was vulnerable to failure in a major hurricane. The storm's aftermath exposed catastrophic failures in government response at all levels, leaving thousands stranded without food, water, or aid for days. Twenty years later, New Orleans has not fully recovered its population, and the event serves as a stark reminder of the immense cost of failing to prepare for natural disasters.</p>

          <p>A new UC Berkeley IGS poll shows that a vast majority of California voters, 69%, disapprove of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies, with nearly all Democrats in opposition. The survey highlights a deep partisan and emotional divide, with 64% of all voters feeling rage or sadness over immigration raids, while 65% of Republicans feel hopeful. The poll also found that most voters believe federal agents should be required to clearly identify themselves and disagree with expanding enforcement into sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. While Republican voters generally support the president's stance, their unity frays on questions regarding due process and agent conduct.</p>

          <p>A small, lightning-sparked fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim, which park officials were managing as a beneficial "good fire," exploded into a massive megafire after an unexpected increase in wind. The blaze destroyed over 70 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, and has burned more than 145,000 acres. The incident has triggered multiple investigations and intense criticism from Arizona politicians, who are questioning the decision to allow a controlled burn during a hot, dry summer. The disaster represents a significant setback for advocates of modern fire science, who now fear that one high-profile failure could undermine public trust in the essential policy of using controlled burns.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military announced that it has killed 35 jihadists in a series of air strikes in the country's northeast, near the border with Cameroon. The operation was conducted to prevent a planned attack by the militants on ground troops. This action comes as Nigeria continues to grapple with a decade-long insurgency from groups like Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province, alongside other security crises. Recently, a group of prominent Nigerians raised alarms about "war-time levels of slaughter" in the country, citing a report that over 10,000 people have been killed since President Bola Tinubu took office two years ago.</p>

          <p>The White House has issued a newsletter criticizing specific artworks and programs at the Smithsonian Institution that focus on race, sexuality, and immigration, following a directive for a "comprehensive review" of the museum's content. The administration aims to align the Smithsonian with President Trump's cultural directives by replacing what it calls "divisive" language with "unifying" descriptions. Artists and scholars whose work was targeted have responded with a mix of shock, fear of censorship, and defiance, with some calling the attention a "badge of honor." Critics of the move draw parallels to historical instances of political censorship, such as McCarthyism, and worry about a chilling effect on artistic expression.</p>

          <p>Critics and political analysts argue that President Trump's policy decisions, both at home and abroad, are consistently guided by his personal self-interest rather than a coherent ideology. This conflation was evident when Trump took advice from Vladimir Putin on mail-in voting, leading to a domestic policy announcement, and when he used meetings with foreign leaders to air domestic grievances or attack political rivals. This approach marks a radical break from presidential norms, where predecessors typically maintained a separation between personal politics and foreign policy. This behavior is seen by some as a sign of deep insecurity and a threat to the consistency of American foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The disclosure that over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in this year's U.S. National Guard's Northern Strike drills in Michigan highlights a significant deepening of defense cooperation between Washington and Taipei. This contingent is the largest ever sent by Taiwan to the American-led exercises and marks the first time such participation figures have been publicly revealed. The move represents a departure from the long-standing U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity and avoiding public discussion of Taiwan's role in its military exercises.

Festival organizers initially cited a policy against flags but later issued a sincere apology to the band for the incident and the poor handling of the situation. In their apology, the organizers pledged to make a substantial donation to humanitarian relief efforts for the Palestinian people.</p>

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the goal is to ensure criminals have their freedom restricted even when not in prison, as part of a move to toughen community punishments.
