          <h2>Internal Debate Among Trump Officials Revealed in Deportation Case</h2>

          <p>A New York Times article reveals a fierce debate among Trump administration officials in three cabinet agencies regarding the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a judge's ruling prohibiting it. Officials discussed portraying Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader without evidence and considered nullifying the order barring his deportation. A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, was fired for advocating Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. The documents highlight the administration's efforts to circumvent the American judicial system and continue mass deportations, and Abrego Garcia remains imprisoned in El Salvador despite court orders for his release.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily suspended by a High Court injunction sought by two Chagossian women. The deal would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, with the British taxpayer expected to pay billions to Mauritius. The claimants argue that the government failed to properly consult the Chagossian people, whose homeland was separated from Mauritius in 1965, and who were later displaced to allow the US to build a military base. The court will hear the case again, with the future of the agreement hanging in the balance.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other chip experts are raising concerns that U.S. semiconductor export controls on China have backfired, causing more harm to American businesses than to China. Huang notes Nvidia's GPU market share in China has significantly decreased. Experts argue the restrictions incentivize China to become self-sufficient in semiconductor production and accelerate domestic innovation, potentially closing the gap between Chinese and U.S. AI capabilities. The restrictions, aimed at curbing China's military advancement, have also cost Nvidia billions in revenue, prompting questions about the policy's effectiveness and long-term consequences.</p>

The bill's passage is uncertain due to the narrow Republican majority and competing priorities among factions, with the White House urging its immediate approval.</p>

While the government has increased decisions on asylum cases, the overall backlog has risen. Efforts to disrupt people-smuggling gangs are ongoing, but data on their effectiveness is limited.

          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing figures for April have increased pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with experts predicting likely tax increases in the autumn. Borrowing reached Â£20.2 billion, Â£1 billion higher than last year, marking the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. While tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Experts suggest the government will struggle to meet economic rules without future tax increases or higher borrowing.</p>

While cold water was briefly offered in a silver chalice, milk returned as an accessory prize and has been enjoyed by 76 winners overall.

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the frontman of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland. Lim's appointment has been praised by metalheads, given Finland's high concentration of metal bands. Beyond his musical career, Lim is recognized for his human rights advocacy and international experience, having served as a legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Chthonic's music often addresses Taiwanese identity and challenges to its international recognition, making Lim's appointment a blend of cultural diplomacy and political advocacy.</p>
