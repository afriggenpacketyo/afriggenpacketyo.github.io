          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic is reportedly in discussions to raise between $3 and $5 billion in a new funding round led by Iconiq Capital. This potential investment would value the OpenAI competitor at a staggering $170 billion, a significant increase from its $61.5 billion valuation in March. The news reflects intense investor appetite for leading AI companies and follows reports of Anthropic reversing its previous stance on accepting funds from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds. The move highlights the immense capital required to remain at the forefront of AI development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman killed four people, including a police officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. New York City Mayor Eric Adams stated the shooter, Shane Tamura, was apparently targeting the NFL offices located in the building. A note found on Tamura indicated he believed he suffered from the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition, despite never having played in the league. The attack has prompted the NFL to advise its New York employees to work from home and has renewed discussions on gun control and mental health.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a 10-day ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine, shortening a previously announced 50-day window. If a deal is not reached by the new deadline of August 8, the administration threatens to impose secondary sanctions and tariffs on countries that continue to do business with Russia. The president expressed growing frustration with Vladimir Putin, stating that diplomatic conversations have not translated into a cessation of hostilities. This move signals a significant escalation in U.S. pressure to end the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The largest rail workers' union in the U.S., SMART Transportation Division, has announced its intention to oppose the proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cited concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices and what it describes as a troubling safety record that prioritizes profits over worker and public safety. SMART-TD, which represents approximately 125,000 rail workers, plans to present its case against the deal to the Surface Transportation Board. The merger, which would create the first coast-to-coast freight rail operator, requires approval from the federal agency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken steps to keep Bill Essayli as the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, bypassing the typical Senate confirmation process. Essayli, an interim appointee, will become the acting U.S. attorney after his initial 120-day term expires, a move that could extend his tenure for another 210 days. This follows a federal judicial panel's decision not to name a permanent replacement. The maneuver is part of a broader administration strategy to keep its appointees in key positions and has drawn criticism and raised legal questions about the authority of such appointments.</p>

The potential deal reflects a trend of consolidation within the cybersecurity industry as companies seek to bolster their security offerings against increasingly sophisticated threats. An acquisition of this scale would be the largest yet for Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and would significantly expand the company's presence in the critical identity and access management market.

Its out-of-print status made original vinyl copies rare and expensive for decades. The remastered release, scheduled for September 19, will make the influential folk-rock album widely available on vinyl, CD, and digital platforms, finally offering fans access to the foundational work of the two iconic musicians.</p>

According to the lawsuit, she had received positive performance reviews and was fired for "unspecified performance issues" after she escalated her complaints.

          <p>An opinion column in the Los Angeles Times argues that a rift is growing between Donald Trump and the ideological wing of the MAGA movement. The author posits that while activists have worked to build a policy framework for an "America First" agenda, the former president often prioritizes his personal instincts and unpredictability over any coherent philosophy. This has led to frustration among his supporters on issues like immigration, foreign policy, and China. The article suggests that "Trumpism" is more of a psychological phenomenon centered on loyalty to a personality than a consistent political ideology like Reaganism.</p>

The survey highlights the intense speculation surrounding the future leadership of the central bank, particularly given President Trump's repeated criticism of Powell's policies.

          <p>Despite a changing economic landscape, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) account in August may still be a worthwhile strategy for savers. While CD rates are no longer at their recent peaks, they remain competitive, with many accounts still offering returns in the 4% to 4.5% range. The absence of a Federal Reserve meeting in August provides a period of rate stability for savers to lock in a favorable return. With the possibility of future Fed rate cuts, particularly in September, this could be one of the last opportunities to secure a high-yield CD before rates potentially decline again.

The agreement includes a non-binding pledge for the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy by 2028, a figure that would require the bloc to nearly triple its current purchasing levels. Market experts point out that the EU cannot compel its member states or private companies to buy U.S. energy, and U.S. production capacity is limited.
