          <h2>Budget Cuts Threaten 9/11 Health Protections, Leaving Community in Crisis</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9/11 health program, which monitors and treats individuals exposed to toxic dust during the 2001 terrorist attack, faces a crisis due to budget cuts and staffing turmoil. These cuts have disrupted the system, leading to potential delays in cancer diagnoses and unmet mental health needs, jeopardizing the federal government's promise to "never forget." The program, established through the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, is struggling to meet rising demand with over 150,000 people enrolled, and patients are experiencing appointment delays of six to eight months. Advocates are urging lawmakers to address funding shortfalls to prevent the program's collapse. Relevant context: toxic dust from the attacks contained a dangerous mix of chemicals and debris: asbestos, ground glass, benzene, chromium, lead. Those exposed potentially face higher rates of at least 69 cancers, as well as respiratory disease and post-traumatic stress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors has reduced its 2025 financial guidance, citing potential tariff exposure of up to $5 billion. Despite this adjustment, CEO Mary Barra emphasized the company's fundamental strength and ongoing adaptation to the evolving trade policy environment, including efforts to strengthen the supply base and drive electric vehicle profitability. The revised guidance incorporates the positive impact of recent changes to some tariffs by the Trump administration, which include reimbursements for certain U.S. parts and reduced stacking of tariffs. GM is working to offset increased costs by increasing U.S. sourced parts and leveraging existing assembly plants to add capacity. Relevant context: GM's new guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, compared with its former guidance of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With millions of American households burdened by credit card debt, experts recommend several steps to avoid defaulting. These include contacting credit card issuers to negotiate payment plans, ceasing further credit card use, creating and adhering to a personal budget, and seeking credit counseling. A debt consolidation loan can be a great way to pay off your credit cards and lower the monthly interest you're paying. Experts emphasize the importance of proactive communication and strategic prioritization of debt repayment to prevent severe financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing drugmakers to invest in U.S. manufacturing, potentially negating the need for their enactment. Mounjaro and Zepbound sales exceeded expectations, but shares of the company fell 5% in premarket trading. Relevant context: The company maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results, with U.S. same-store sales declining by 3.6%, the largest domestic drop since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <p>A former Guantánamo lawyer draws parallels between the detention facility and the Trump administration's deportation regime, highlighting disturbing similarities in the denial of procedural rights and demonization of individuals. The article cites the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian citizen with a deportation protection order, who was wrongly deported and whose return the administration has resisted. The author emphasizes the need for due process and accountability to prevent wrongful detentions and deportations, echoing the concerns raised during the Guantánamo era. The article argues that tragic mistakes have already been uncovered and these ad hoc discoveries show how often, and how easily, people can be wrongfully captured, detained and deported based on untested allegations from some unknown and unaccountable bureaucrats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts weigh in on whether it is easier to qualify for a HELOC or a home equity loan, noting that a HELOC may be easier due to interest rates often based on the prime rate plus a margin. Borrowers are increasingly opting for HELOCs in anticipation of future Federal Reserve rate cuts. While it's helpful to know whether a home equity loan or HELOC is easier to obtain, that shouldn't be the only factor in your decision. It's more important to consider how you plan to use the funds, how you want to repay them and whether you prefer fixed or flexible terms.</p>

Author Julia Donaldson and illustrator Axel Scheffler are teaming up again for the new book, set to be published in 2026. The new book will be the third about the beloved animal - after 1999's best-selling original and 2004's sequel The Gruffalo's Child. The first two books have sold 18 million copies, and Donaldson hopes the new story will encourage shared reading experiences.</p>

          <p>Manchester United will head to Bilbao for a Europa League semi-final first leg knowing two of their potential three remaining games in the competition will come at San Mames, which will also host the final. San Mames is a symbol of Basque identity, just as Athletic have become a Basque institution through their philosophy of only fielding players who are born or raised in the region. It is a stadium where tradition prevails, with rituals such as the alboka and txalaparta, to the 'Txoria Txori', when players embrace after the game and sing in unison with the fans.</p>

          <p>More than three out of four Germans support cutting the benefits given to newly arrived Ukrainians.

According to a YouGov survey, 77% of people favor the change, while only 11% oppose it.</p>

          <p>The minerals deal signed between the United States and Ukraine could bring untold money into a joint investment fund between the two countries that would help rebuild Ukraine whenever the war with Russia ends. The text of the agreement, made public by Ukraine’s government, made no mention of the security guarantees that Kyiv had long sought. The deal also seemed to specifically keep the door open for Ukraine to eventually join the European Union, a move that neither the United States nor Russia has opposed. The much-anticipated signing of the agreement has almost certainly accomplished one thing that seemed almost impossible two months ago: It has tied Mr. Trump to the future of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office have been beneficial for the US meat industry, with actions that benefit the industry at the expense of the environment, animals, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers. These actions include speeding up slaughter lines, rolling back food safety measures, and gutting the USDA’s animal welfare research department. The one striking exception, of course, are the tariffs, which farm groups have opposed and are already feeling the sting from. The ensuing trade war has reduced two of US agriculture’s most important exports to China: pork and soybeans.</p>

The BOJ has revised down its growth and inflation outlooks, factoring in the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The central bank expects to stably achieve its 2 percent inflation target in the latter half of the three years through March 2028, a year later than its January forecast. As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent for the second consecutive meeting.</p>

The article cites examples such as the mistaken letter to Harvard University, the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García, and the erroneous notice sent to Ukrainian refugees. The author argues that these mistakes are not isolated incidents but reflect a governing philosophy of "rule by error," where errors are used to cover up or excuse authoritarian practices.</p>

Start-ups like Evvy are funding trials, but health policy insiders warn that these small projects cannot match the retreat of federal government research. Robert F Kennedy Jr and billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” have fired 1,300 NIH employees, canceled $2bn in grants, and slowed new grant approval by nearly one-third, pumping $2.3bn less into research.</p>
