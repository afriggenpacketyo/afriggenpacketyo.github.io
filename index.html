          <p>A strike by New Jersey Transit rail engineers commenced, halting commuter trains and impacting hundreds of thousands of commuters in the New York City metropolitan region. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) union initiated the strike due to unresolved contract disputes over pay increases, with union representatives claiming they haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri stated that the agency had offered a deal, but it was rejected by the union, and he emphasized the need for a fiscally responsible agreement. The strike will significantly disrupt commutes, with NJ Transit implementing a contingency plan that can only accommodate a fraction of daily riders, urging commuters to work from home if possible. The article highlights the perspectives of both sides and the potential impact on the region's transportation and economy.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an image on Instagram that was interpreted by some as a call for violence against President Trump. The image, which Comey later deleted, depicted seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," a phrase often used by critics of the president to suggest his removal from office. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Comey had "called for the assassination" of Mr. Trump, prompting an investigation by the Secret Service. Comey claimed he was unaware of the violent associations of the numbers and removed the post, but the incident has sparked controversy and criticism from Trump administration officials.

          <p>Europe has been cautioned to implement rapid reforms to prevent becoming a 'shock absorber' amidst the trade tensions between the United States and China. While recent talks in Geneva led to a reduction in tariffs, economists warn that Europe's future depends on its ability to adapt to Washington's efforts to reshape global trade. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without influencing the outcomes. The article suggests that Europe must proactively shape its own strategy to maintain its position in the evolving global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported disappointing earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company's revenue and net income fell short of analyst expectations, despite a year-on-year revenue increase. Alibaba attributed some losses to the disposal of subsidiaries, although this was partially offset by gains in income from operations and changes in equity investment valuations. Macroeconomic volatility and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have impacted consumer sentiment in China, contributing to the company's challenges.

Conservatives have often filed cases challenging the Biden administration in small Texas courts, ensuring Republican appointees would issue the initial rulings. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions.

          <p>Japan's economy experienced its first contraction in a year, shrinking by 0.2% in the March quarter due to a decline in exports. The gross domestic product data was weaker than expected, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter.

Despite the contraction, Japan's GDP expanded 1.7% year-on-year, the largest expansion since the first quarter of 2023.

          <h2>California's Commercial Crab Season Threatened by Whale Migration</h2>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season faces challenges due to the migration of endangered humpback whales, which are getting entangled in the ropes used to pull up crab cages. Traditional fishing methods pose a threat to the whales, leading to maiming or death. Some fishermen are experimenting with high-tech systems that use remote-controlled pop-up devices to reduce the amount of rope needed. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is regulating the crab fishing season to protect whales, shortening the season and promoting the use of alternative fishing methods. The article highlights the conflict between the fishing industry and whale conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court justices have questioned Donald Trump’s attempt to sidestep the constitution to limit birthright citizenship, in a trio of immigration cases that could reshape presidential power and the role of federal courts. The cases stem from the president’s January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren’t citizens or permanent residents. The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States”.</p>
