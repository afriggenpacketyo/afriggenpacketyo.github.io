          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily delayed a lower court's order that blocked President Trump's tariffs, reinstating them for the time being. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an administrative stay while it considers Trump's appeal, after the administration urged the New York-based Court of International Trade to delay its order, warning that enforcement of the ruling would cause a ‚Äúforeign policy disaster scenario.‚Äù The original ruling struck down Trump's global tariffs as "contrary to law," stating that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give him the "unlimited" power to levy tariffs. The case now heads to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose substantial tariffs, including a 50% charge on the European Union, was thrown into question after judges blocked his across-the-board levies. This development has caused cautious reactions among America's trading partners, who are now assessing the implications of the legal challenges to Trump's trade policies. The initial announcement of tariffs had created uncertainty in international markets, and the court's decision has added another layer of complexity to the global trade landscape. The situation remains fluid as the Trump administration considers its next steps in trade negotiations. Optimism is measured as businesses and governments await further clarification.

          <p>The Trump administration's resumption of student loan payments is negatively impacting many borrowers' credit records, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Credit scores dropped by more than 100 points for 2.2 million delinquent student loan borrowers from January through March of 2025, and another 1 million borrowers experienced credit score drops of at least 150 points. The end of the 12-month "on ramp" period, instituted by the U.S. Department of Education, has resulted in newly delinquent student borrowers' credit scores being negatively affected as their failures to pay back their debts are reported to credit bureaus. The long-term consequences include lower credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans, and limited access to credit in general. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has set a goal to arrest 3,000 people a day in its anti-immigration agenda, demanding that federal agents arrest over a million people in a year. This new target, tripling arrest figures from earlier this year, was delivered to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) leaders by Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem. The crackdown includes new tactics such as mandating federal law enforcement agents outside Ice to assist in arrests and transports, and arresting people at locations that were once protected, like courthouses. Critics argue that this action has led to citizens being caught up in the dragnet, Ice skirting due process, and overcrowding in detention centers.</p>

This decision has sparked criticism from neighboring Jordan and Britain, with a U.K. official calling it a "deliberate obstacle" to Palestinian statehood. The international community largely views settlements as illegal and an impediment to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government defends the move as strengthening their hold on the region and preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.

          <p>Robert Jarvik, the designer of the first permanent artificial heart, has died at the age of 79. He worked with a team at the University of Utah to create a mechanical heart, which was later used in patients awaiting an organ transplant. The Jarvik-7 artificial heart was a significant advancement in medical technology, providing a temporary solution for patients with severe heart failure. His contributions have had a lasting impact on the field of cardiology.</p>

          <p>About 20 Los Angeles Times subscribers attended a hike to Sycamore Canyon falls in Point Mugu State Park. The 3.5-mile trek started on the Wendy Trail in Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa, national parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains. Hikers learned about efforts to restore the land back to oak woodlands and coastal sage scrub. The group navigated steep inclines and rocky terrain before reaching the waterfall, where they rested before hiking back as the sun started coming out. The event provided an opportunity for subscribers to connect with nature and each other.</p>
