          <p>A group of Nepali-speaking Bhutanese individuals, deported from the U.S. after years of resettlement, are facing statelessness as both Nepal and Bhutan deny them citizenship. These individuals, originally refugees who fled Bhutan in the 1990s due to ethnic persecution, were deported following minor offenses in the U.S. and were then shuttled between Bhutan and Nepal, with neither country willing to accept them. The situation highlights the complexities and vulnerabilities faced by resettled refugees with criminal records and raises questions about the terms of their deportation from the U.S. and Bhutan's responsibilities towards its former citizens.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have filed a formal notice seeking the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

          <p>New York Jets head coach Aaron Glenn addressed Aaron Rodgers' recent criticisms of their final meeting by deflecting the question with a joke about the team's first-round draft pick. Rodgers had claimed he felt disrespected by Glenn's handling of their conversation, where he was informed the Jets were moving in a different direction at quarterback. Glenn's humorous response, mentioning the Jets' new offensive tackle Armand Membou, was praised by general manager Darren Mougey, signaling an attempt to move past the Rodgers drama and focus on the team's future with new quarterback Justin Fields.</p>

A critical report from the National Audit Office also accuses the government and regulators of failing to manage risks and drive investment, leading to higher consumer bills and environmental damage.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly had an unsecured internet connection installed in his office to bypass Pentagon security filters and use Signal on a personal device, raising concerns about potential security breaches. This revelation follows earlier reports of Hegseth and other top officials using Signal to discuss sensitive military operations, like strikes on Yemen.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at accelerating deep-sea mining to reduce U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals. The order seeks to expedite mining permits and establish processes for issuing permits in international waters.

The move has sparked controversy, with environmental groups calling for a moratorium and raising concerns about bypassing international regulations overseen by the International Seabed Authority (ISA).</p>

          <p>California's entertainment industry is lobbying for expanded film and TV tax credits to stem production decline and save jobs. While proponents argue it's a vital lifeline, critics view it as a corporate giveaway with questionable economic benefits. The debate coincides with California's challenging economic outlook, raising difficult questions about budget priorities. The proposed legislation aims to make California more competitive by increasing the tax credit and expanding eligibility, but faces opposition from those who believe it diverts resources from other critical needs.</p>

Researchers found a strong link between colibactin-related mutations and colon cancer, particularly among those under 40. The exposure to this DNA-damaging toxin appears to occur during childhood, potentially setting individuals on a faster trajectory for developing cancer. While colibactin is unlikely to be the sole cause, it is considered one factor among many that contribute to the development of colorectal cancer.</p>
