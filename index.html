          <p>Former President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports to encourage long-term strategic focus. In a post on Truth Social, he argued the change, which would require SEC approval, would save money and allow managers to better run their companies, contrasting it with what he described as China's long-term business perspective. This idea echoes a 2018 proposal by Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who argued against quarterly guidance for similar reasons. Supporters of the current system, however, emphasize the importance of transparency and timely information for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Career coaches are advising job seekers to avoid over-relying on artificial intelligence for crafting resumes and applications, as it can lead to significant errors and a lack of authenticity. Experts note that AI tools can fabricate information, or "hallucinate," to match a resume to a job description, creating inaccuracies that candidates may struggle to defend in interviews. Recruiters also report that AI-generated applications often share a uniform, keyword-stuffed structure, making them less effective than those written in a candidate's own voice. The advice is to use AI for polishing a self-written draft rather than for initial generation to avoid critical mistakes.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Phil Mickelson has publicly criticized what he termed "disgusting rhetoric" emerging after the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. In a social media post, Mickelson expressed that the tragedy has revealed both the best and worst of humanity, praising the global unification and support for Kirk. However, he also condemned the extremism and moral superiority displayed by those supporting the alleged assassin's actions, stating it has shaken his belief in people. Mickelson emphasized that Kirk's intellectual prowess in debates was what his opponents feared, highlighting the polarizing reactions to the violent event.</p>

          <p>Amid high interest rates and limited housing inventory, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance face a difficult market. As of September 11, 2025, national average rates for a 30-year mortgage stand at 6.53%, while a 30-year refinance rate is slightly higher at 6.72%, according to Bankrate data. Experts suggest that strengthening one's credit profile into the mid-to-high 700s is crucial for securing the best possible rates. While the market remains challenging, a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could offer some relief to borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Documents show that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook designated a condominium she purchased in 2021 as a "vacation home" on a loan estimate, a detail that could weaken fraud claims made by the Trump administration. President Trump has been attempting to remove Cook from her position, alleging she committed mortgage fraud by claiming two properties as primary residences simultaneously.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) offer more affordable borrowing options compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of mid-September 2025, the average interest rate for a 10-year home equity loan is 8.38%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. These rates, which are influenced by factors like location and credit score, are considerably lower than other consumer credit products. Experts note that these financing tools may also provide tax benefits if the funds are used for eligible home improvements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Community organizers in Chicago are pushing back against the Trump administration's threats to deploy the national guard, arguing that such actions politicize residents' pain without offering real solutions to violent crime. Activists like Teny Gross of the Institute for Nonviolence Chicago state that the city's violence stems from decades of policy failures and requires investment, not increased law enforcement in already overpoliced communities. They contend that the administration is exploiting Chicago's reputation for violence to justify state force. Instead, they advocate for improved crime clearance rates, victim support services, and efforts to control gun trafficking as more effective measures.</p>

City focused its attack down the left flank, using wide positioning from its left-back to draw United's wing-back out and create an overload in the midfield. This strategy, combined with clever player movement and pinning tactics, left United's defenders in disarray and repeatedly gave City's attackers space to operate. The article suggests that while individual mistakes were a factor, the loss highlighted systemic issues in United's disjointed pressing scheme, which manager Ruben Amorim has so far been reluctant to change.</p>

          <p>Africa is becoming a pivotal producer of critical minerals like cobalt, platinum, and manganese, which are essential for green energy and technology. This boom could boost the continent's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years, but significant challenges remain. Issues such as government fragility, environmental degradation from mining, and inequitable revenue sharing hinder progress. A UN report estimates that African nations currently generate only about 40% of the potential revenue from their mineral wealth. To fully capitalize on these resources, countries must move beyond raw material extraction and develop domestic refining capabilities to capture more value.</p>

          <h2>Exploitation of Critical Minerals Fuels Instability and Conflict in Central and West Africa</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 08:19:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global demand for critical minerals is exacerbating instability across Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where conflicts over resources like coltan are rampant. Rebel groups, allegedly backed by Rwanda, have seized control of key mining sites and are smuggling minerals, contaminating global supply chains. This has led to decades of unrest and violence in the region. Meanwhile, in the Sahel, political instability and military coups have caused investors to flee, shifting mining interests to more stable countries like the Ivory Coast. The mineral race is reshaping populations and economies, often with detrimental consequences for local communities.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Prince Harry asserted that his "conscience is clear" regarding the revelations in his memoir, "Spare," and other public statements about the Royal Family. He stated that he does not believe he aired "dirty linen in public" but rather delivered a difficult message in the best way he could. The Duke of Sussex, who now resides in the U.S., made these comments during a trip to Ukraine to promote his Invictus Games Foundation. He also spoke about his ongoing legal battles with British tabloids, framing them as a fight for accountability rather than revenge.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel will not rule out further strikes against Hamas leaders, asserting that they lack immunity "wherever they are." His comments came during a press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, following an Israeli attack in Qatar that targeted senior Hamas officials. Netanyahu emphasized that Israel acted alone in the strike, which drew international criticism. The statement signals a continuation of Israel's aggressive stance against the militant group amid ongoing military operations in Gaza and heightened diplomatic tensions over the conflict and Israeli settlement expansion.</p>

          <p>Despite recent political turmoil in Nepal, including the dissolution of its parliament, relations with China are expected to remain stable.

The statement emphasized that China is prepared to continue working with Nepal to advance cooperation across various fields. This indicates that the long-standing friendship between the two countries is not anticipated to be significantly impacted by Nepal's internal political changes, with a general election now scheduled for March.</p>

          <p>Public health experts are expressing alarm over a significant loss of expertise at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) due to high-profile departures and layoffs. They warn that this brain drain, coupled with an erosion of public trust and efforts by political leaders to undermine vaccine guidance, leaves the nation vulnerable to rising health threats. Critics point to the conservative blueprint Project 2025, which aims to strip the agency of its authority, and the appointment of leaders without public health backgrounds. The ongoing changes are predicted to have long-lasting negative consequences for America's health preparedness and response capabilities.</p>

          <p>China has formally accused U.S. chipmaker Nvidia of breaching its antimonopoly laws and announced it will intensify scrutiny of the company. The accusation stems from a preliminary investigation into Nvidia's $6.9 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020, which regulators claim violated regulations. This move heightens tensions between Beijing and Washington, coinciding with ongoing trade talks between the two nations in Spain. The decision follows other recent actions by China to increase pressure on the U.S. chip industry, including antidumping and antidiscrimination investigations into American semiconductor products and policies.

Chains like Wawa and Casey's General Store are attracting diners with quality made-to-order items, greater variety, and perceived value.

This system has made small drone teams incredibly lethal, accounting for a majority of Russian casualties.
