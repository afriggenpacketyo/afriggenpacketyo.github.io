            <p>The bond market signaled strong disapproval of President Trump's tariff plans, leading to a significant surge in Treasury yields and broader market turmoil.

            <p>President Trump held a Cabinet meeting with top officials, including Elon Musk, following his decision to pause higher tariffs for most countries while increasing them on China to 145%.

As stocks surged on the news, these funds were forced to buy back borrowed stocks to limit losses, creating an artificial buying force that propelled the S&P 500 to its third-biggest gain since World War II.

            <p>China's National Film Administration announced it will reduce the number of American films allowed to be shown in China as the tariff battle between the two nations intensifies. This decision follows President Trump's increase of tariffs on Chinese exports to 145%. Chinese officials cited the United States' "abuse [of] tariffs" as a factor that will inevitably reduce the domestic audience's favorability towards American films. This move signals a potential shift in China's film market, which has been a crucial audience for Hollywood blockbusters, and reflects the broader economic tensions between the two countries.</p>

            <p>This article explores how the advent of photography in the 19th century influenced perceptions of self and public figures, using Abraham Lincoln as a case study. The author details how an 11-year-old girl's suggestion that Lincoln grow a beard reflected the growing awareness of appearance in the photographic age. Lincoln's decision to grow a beard, along with a carefully crafted photograph by Mathew Brady, helped shape a more favorable public image during a time when physical appearance was increasingly scrutinized. This illustrates the profound impact of photography on politics and self-presentation.</p>

            <p>The White House defended President Trump's decision to pause reciprocal tariffs, dismissing allegations of insider trading as "partisan games." Democratic senators have called for an investigation into potential insider trading, citing Trump's social media posts and the timing of the tariff pause. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the pause was due to Trump wanting to be personally involved in negotiations with numerous countries. This controversy underscores the political tensions surrounding the administration's trade policies and the scrutiny they face from political opponents.</p>

            <p>Inflation slowed down in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, but economists warn that tariffs could reverse this trend in the coming months. The consumer price index rose 2.4% for the 12 months ended in March, down from 2.8% in February. However, economists caution that the Trump administration's tariff policy poses a significant headwind, potentially pushing the U.S. inflation rate to a peak around 4% by the end of 2025. The situation is complicated by trouble spots like grocery prices, particularly for eggs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Modelo and Corona, reports that President Trump's hardline immigration stance is negatively affecting beer sales, as Hispanic consumers in the U.S. reduce their spending. CEO Bill Newlands noted that concerns about immigration issues and job losses in Latino-heavy industries are causing Hispanic consumers to cut back on discretionary spending, including social gatherings where beer is often consumed. This adds to the challenges faced by the company, which is also grappling with tariffs on Mexican imports. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent pivot on tariffs demonstrates that Wall Street still holds considerable influence within his administration. The decision to roll back the highest tariffs on most countries, except China, came after significant market turmoil and warnings of a potential recession. Trump acknowledged that he changed course after seeing the market's reaction and hearing JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's concerns. This episode underscores the importance of market stability in shaping the administration's economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

While Badenoch indicated that local Tory leaders would be free to share power with Reform to keep councils running, Farage stated that Reform UK has "no intention in forming coalitions with the Tories at any level." He did, however, leave the door open for more informal cooperation. The article explores the political dynamics between the two parties and their strategies for the upcoming local elections.</p>

            <p>This article argues that while President Trump's tariff pause may have averted an immediate economic crisis, lasting harm has already been inflicted. Trump's erratic approach to tariffs has created uncertainty for businesses, rattled financial markets, and undermined confidence in the dollar. The author suggests that the perceived safety of U.S. Treasuries has been compromised, potentially leading to higher interest rates and a more volatile bond market. The article concludes that the trade war between the U.S. and China will likely continue, negatively impacting consumers and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>
