          <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar stated that Israel's attacks on Iran have slowed down Iran's nuclear weapons development by at least two to three years. Saar highlighted the elimination of key individuals leading the weaponization efforts as a significant achievement. Israel remains convinced that Iran is attempting to build nuclear weapons, an accusation Iran denies, claiming its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. However, experts and the International Atomic Energy Agency have questioned Iran's claims, adding to the ongoing international scrutiny of the Iranian nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The United States Pentagon has rerouted the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group from the Indo-Pacific to the Middle East. This marks the fourth such maneuver by the U.S. Navy in less than a year, raising concerns in Taiwan about balancing immediate operational needs with long-term strategic interests. The redeployment occurs amidst escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran, prompting the U.S. to bolster its military presence in the region. The USS Nimitz halted operations in the South China Sea and canceled a planned docking in Vietnam to support the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group.</p>
