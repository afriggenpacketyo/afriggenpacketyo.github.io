          <p>A poet and volunteer for the Church of England in Leicester recounts a harrowing stalking campaign initiated by a lay preacher after he rejected her advances. The abuse escalated from online harassment to real-world threats, including false allegations of child sexual assault, causing significant distress. The article details how both the police and the Church, particularly the Bishop of Leicester, initially failed to protect him, with the bishop even accusing the victim of witchcraft. The perpetrator was eventually convicted, but the experience highlights severe institutional shortcomings in handling such cases.</p>

          <p>A major Republican spending package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," narrowly cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate following prolonged negotiations. Several conservative senators, who initially withheld support over concerns about deficit reduction and Medicaid, eventually voted to advance the bill after securing promises for amendment votes. The late-night session was marked by high drama, with Vice President JD Vance present for a potential tie-breaking vote that was ultimately not needed. The bill now faces a lengthy reading on the Senate floor before a final vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese civil servants are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent and constantly changing local austerity measures that often go beyond central government regulations. An official from Sichuan province reported that his department head implemented a ban on eating out, reflecting a broader trend of adding extra layers of control. This shift in lifestyle is a direct response to the heightened scrutiny on official conduct and spending under the current anti-corruption climate. The officials interviewed indicate this is a significant change driven by top-down pressure within the bureaucracy.</p>

The article highlights the case of Mandonna Kashanian, who lived in the U.S. for 47 years before being detained by ICE, despite regularly checking in with immigration officials. Advocacy groups express concern that the arrests are a broad roundup rather than targeted enforcement, fueled by recent military tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

The trial detailed Woodward's involvement with the extremist group Atomwaffen Division and the brutal nature of the 2018 stabbing.

The initiative, part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, aims to make healthy eating more accessible and relieve pressure on the health service.

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric directed at judges from both sides of the political aisle. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts expressed concern that when politicians frame judges as part of a political dispute, it can incite threats and violence. He referenced past instances where he felt compelled to speak out against comments from both President Trump and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Roberts stressed that while criticism is part of the job, threatening statements from high-level officials are inappropriate and dangerous for the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has renewed his strong criticism of President Trump's major spending and tax cut package, arguing it will "destroy millions of jobs" and harm future industries. In a series of posts on X, Musk called the bill a "disgusting abomination" that offers handouts to old industries while damaging new ones, and suggested its passage would be political suicide for Republicans. This reignites a recent public feud between Musk and the Trump administration, which he briefly served. Musk's sharp condemnation adds another challenge for Republican leaders as they work to pass the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Huge crowds of anti-government protesters, estimated at around 140,000, clashed with police in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. The student-led demonstrations, the largest in recent months, have been ongoing for months following a deadly building collapse that protesters blame on corruption. Riot police used tear gas and stun grenades against the crowd, and dozens were arrested. President Vucic has condemned the protests as a foreign plot and has so far refused calls for a snap election, while organizers blame the government for the escalation.</p>

          <p>China's decision to halt exports of rare earth materials is expected to accelerate efforts to establish alternative production facilities in other countries. According to American firm REalloys, building a non-Chinese supply chain is feasible but will be a costly and lengthy process due to significant technical and financial hurdles. The company plans a US$50 million project in collaboration with a Canadian research council to produce high-performance magnet materials. Analysts suggest that new overseas projects may require government subsidies and tariffs to compete with China's long-standing dominance in the global market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, this article explains the phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect, which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain the sun's heat more than natural landscapes. This stored heat is released slowly, keeping urban temperatures elevated, especially at night. The effect is compounded by waste heat from vehicles and buildings, and a lack of cooling vegetation and water, making city dwellers more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>

The initiative, led by the Melanoma Fund charity, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong healthy habits and give children a sense of control over their own skin protection.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The government had attempted to ban the march, citing a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. However, Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, used a legal loophole to allow the event to proceed, calling it a peaceful show of force against a "puffed-up and hateful power." The large turnout transformed the annual Pride event into a broader protest against Orban's increasingly authoritarian rule.</p>

          <p>Following its recent 12-day war with Israel, the Iranian regime has deepened its domestic crackdown, executing several men on disputed espionage charges and arresting hundreds more. Human rights activists report that the government is using the post-war climate to instill fear, accelerate its use of the death penalty, and tighten control over citizens' online activities in what state media calls an "intelligence jihad." Many Iranians express fear of the regime's repressive measures, which are seen as a form of collective punishment and an effort to reassert control after the conflict.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 19:21:07 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing challenge of youth vaping in the UK, even after a ban on disposable vapes came into effect. It features a mother who, in a desperate attempt to control her teenagers' nicotine addiction, has resorted to illegally buying them lower-nicotine vapes herself. Health experts and Trading Standards officials express concern that the ban has had little effect, with some legal rechargeable vapes now being marketed directly to children. The piece highlights the severity of nicotine addiction among youth and the need for more pediatric addiction services to address the growing problem.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes across Gaza have killed at least 72 people, including civilians in a tent camp and near a stadium sheltering displaced people, according to Hamas-run health ministry officials. The attacks continue amid a dire humanitarian crisis and renewed diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire. President Trump commented on Friday that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached "within the next week." However, talks have repeatedly stalled, with Hamas seeking a permanent end to the war in exchange for hostages, a condition Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has rejected.</p>
