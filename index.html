          <p>Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs has cautioned that ongoing aggressive posturing by the United States towards China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. In an interview, Sachs stated that the U.S. initiated the trade war and must show prudence, as both nations have economic leverage over each other and mutual gains from cooperation. He also suggested that China should focus its export growth on markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. and Europe, which he predicts will remain disharmonious.

          <p>Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas for Chicago to prevent a vote on a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. By leaving the state, they deny the legislature the two-thirds quorum required for a vote, effectively stalling the process. The proposed map, backed by former President Trump, aims to create several new heavily Republican districts, which Democrats argue is a "power grab" designed to rig future elections. This tactic has been used before in Texas politics, with lawmakers now facing potential daily fines for their absence.</p>

          <p>Rescue operations at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have concluded with the discovery of the last of five trapped miners, bringing the total death toll from the incident to six. The collapse occurred following a 4.2 magnitude tremor, trapping the workers deep underground. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, expressed condolences as authorities confirmed the fatalities and announced the start of a criminal investigation. The probe will examine whether the tremor was caused by mining activity or natural tectonic shifts.</p>

          <p>Russia's Krasheninnikov Volcano, located on the Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash cloud thousands of feet into the air and prompting an aviation alert. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck 143 miles away, raising questions about a potential link between the two events. Seismologists suggest that while the quake likely didn't trigger the eruption on its own, its seismic waves could have disturbed the volcano's magma system, which may have already been close to erupting.</p>

Video of the incident shows the boat rocking violently upon impact, though the person who fell overboard was reportedly unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center was alerted to the whale's presence near Barnegat Bay shortly before the collision was reported. The whale's carcass was later found in shallow water, and a necropsy is planned to investigate further.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson will not compete in the 200-meter event at the upcoming World Championships after narrowly failing to qualify at the U.S. Track and Field Championships. She finished her heat just one-hundredth of a second behind the final qualifier. This athletic setback concludes a difficult week for the 25-year-old, who was arrested days earlier following an alleged domestic violence incident. Richardson will still compete in the 100-meter event at the World Championships, for which she had an automatic bye as the defending champion.</p>

However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid.

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a new $50 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals will be available in early September. The fund was established as part of a larger legislative package that also included significant cuts to Medicaid, raising concerns about the financial viability of rural healthcare providers. According to Dr. Oz, the funds are intended to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the implementation of new technologies like telehealth to improve healthcare delivery in underserved areas.</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are seeking elected office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These former prosecutors, who have resigned or been fired, are running for positions ranging from U.S. Congress to local city attorney, openly criticizing decisions they witnessed, such as the dismantling of anti-corruption and civil rights divisions. Lacking political experience, they are campaigning on their public service backgrounds and their desire to restore what they see as threatened institutional norms.</p>

          <p>Hazy skies and poor air quality are affecting large parts of the U.S. Midwest and Northeast due to smoke drifting south from hundreds of wildfires across Canada. States including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York have issued air quality alerts, advising residents to limit outdoor activities. Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, with wind patterns pushing the smoke into the U.S. Forecasters predict this pattern may continue, potentially leading to prolonged periods of unhealthy air for millions of Americans.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 14:47:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with payouts likely to be less than £950 per deal. The plan follows a Supreme Court ruling which found that hidden commissions were not inherently unlawful but could be deemed unfair if excessively large. While this prevents widespread claims, the FCA will proceed with a redress scheme for those affected by the largest commissions, covering agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator will consult on the details, with the first payments expected next year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former judge and prominent Fox News personality, to the powerful position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Pirro, a staunch loyalist of President Trump, was approved in a 50-45 vote. She had been serving in the role on an acting basis since May, following the collapsed nomination of a previous candidate. The confirmation places a well-known political commentator in charge of one of the nation's most significant prosecutorial offices, which handles a vast portfolio of federal cases.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced it will update an exhibit at the National Museum of American History to include information about President Trump's two impeachments. The statement followed a report that a temporary placard referencing the impeachments had been removed from the "American Presidency" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government official. The museum affirmed its responsibility to "tell accurate and complete histories" and will update the section accordingly.</p>

He emphasized the deeply integrated nature of the two economies and expressed hope that a deal beneficial to both nations can still be reached.</p>
