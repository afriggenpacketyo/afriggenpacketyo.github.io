          <h2>Spotify Stock Declines 8% Following Weak Guidance and CEO's Dissatisfaction with Ad Business</h2>

          <p>Spotify's shares dropped over 8% after its second-quarter results missed Wall Street expectations, with weak guidance for the current quarter. The company reported a net loss of 86 million euros, despite a 10% revenue increase and growth in monthly active users and paying subscribers. CEO Daniel Ek expressed unhappiness with the advertising business's execution, though he remains confident in its long-term strategy. The company is focusing on ad stack adoption and new tools, while also increasing its share repurchase program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PayPal's stock fell more than 8% despite better-than-expected second-quarter results, primarily due to slowing growth in transaction margin dollars, a key profitability measure. While total payment volume exceeded estimates and active accounts rose, the growth in transaction margin dollars decelerated sequentially. Venmo, however, showed strong revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, indicating success in monetizing acquisitions. PayPal raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast, implying a stronger fourth quarter.</p>

Trump also criticized wind turbines and advocated for North Sea oil and gas exploitation during his visit.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the automotive giant, reinstated its financial guidance for the second half of the year despite reporting a first-half net loss of 2.3 billion euros, primarily due to a $1.7 billion tariff impact. New CEO Antonio Filosa acknowledged the challenges, including North American inventory issues, but expressed confidence in re-establishing profitable growth. The company expects improved industrial free cash flow and low-single-digit adjusted operating income profitability in the coming months. This outlook assumes current tariff and trade rules remain in place, following recent agreements between the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey identifies Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as leading contenders for the next Federal Reserve Chair. While President Trump has criticized current Chair Jerome Powell, the survey suggests Powell is unlikely to be fired before his term ends. Respondents graded Powell's performance as B- and believe Trump's pressure makes rate cuts less likely.

Many importers are now holding back new shipments or absorbing current tariff costs rather than fully passing them to inflation-weary shoppers. While a full blow has yet to land, higher costs are still expected, especially if steeper tariffs are implemented as threatened in August.</p>
