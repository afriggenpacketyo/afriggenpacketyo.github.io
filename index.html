          <p>AI startup Anthropic has successfully closed a $13 billion funding round, elevating its post-money valuation to $183 billion. This figure is approximately three times its valuation from a previous funding round in March. The financing, led by investors like Iconiq and Fidelity, highlights strong investor confidence in the company's growth and its AI assistant, Claude. Anthropic plans to use the capital for safety research, meeting enterprise demand, and international expansion amid fierce competition with rival OpenAI.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" in an effort to win back customers affected by inflation and economic uncertainty. The initiative, starting September 8, includes deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. This move comes after the company reported a significant drop in traffic from low-income consumers who have been cutting back on dining out. The focus on value aims to boost sluggish sales, particularly during breakfast hours.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the relocation of the U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama. The decision reverses a 2023 move by the Biden administration to keep the headquarters in Colorado. The announcement also referenced other administration actions, including a pushback from Illinois' governor against deploying troops in Chicago and a new DHS program offering bonuses to law enforcement for immigration enforcement. The Space Command move was reportedly favored by the Air Force for cost-saving reasons.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Afghanistan that killed over 1,400 people, fake and AI-generated images and videos are circulating on social media. Fact-checkers have identified fraudulent content, including an AI-generated video of a mass funeral that was previously linked to floods in Pakistan. These fabricated visuals, which often contain tell-tale signs like unnatural movements and intact buildings, are being used to solicit donations and spread misinformation. This article highlights the growing challenge of distinguishing authentic disaster footage from sophisticated digital fakes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Jim Banks of Indiana has introduced legislation aimed at toughening sentencing for young adult offenders in Washington, D.C. The "DC CRIMES Act" seeks to lower the age definition of a "youth offender" from 24 to 18, aligning with President Trump's recent focus on cracking down on crime in the capital. The bill would also limit judicial discretion for lighter sentences and mandate the publication of juvenile crime data. This legislative effort is part of a broader push by the administration to address rising crime rates in the city.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers an interest rate cut in September, savers with certificate of deposit (CD) accounts are advised to avoid certain mistakes. The article warns against shopping for rates for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their offers before an official Fed announcement. It also suggests actively monitoring the rate environment and planning for maturing CDs to prevent them from automatically rolling over into new accounts with lower returns. Taking proactive steps can help savers maximize their earnings in a changing interest rate climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details several ways retirees could unexpectedly lose or see a reduction in their Social Security benefits. Claiming benefits before full retirement age while still working above a certain income threshold can trigger temporary reductions. Additionally, benefits can be garnished to pay for federal debts like back taxes or student loans, and a portion can be subject to income tax depending on one's total earnings. Changes in eligibility, such as remarriage for those receiving spousal benefits, can also impact payments, highlighting the need for careful retirement planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate in September, the effect on mortgage rates may be less significant than homebuyers hope. The anticipated cut is only a marginal 25 basis points, which is unlikely to cause a dramatic drop in borrowing costs. Furthermore, many lenders may have already priced this expected cut into their current mortgage offers. Since mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's actions, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, a substantial decrease will likely require broader economic shifts.

          <p>A French anesthetist, Frederic Pechier, is facing trial for allegedly poisoning 30 patients, 12 of whom died, between 2008 and 2017. Prosecutors accuse the 53-year-old doctor of intentionally tampering with his colleagues' anesthesia pouches to trigger medical emergencies during surgeries. It is alleged that he did this to demonstrate his resuscitation skills and discredit his co-workers. Pechier, who faces a life sentence if convicted, has denied all charges, claiming the incidents were the result of medical errors made by others.</p>

          <p>As diplomatic discussions about a potential peace deal between Ukraine and Russia continue, many residents in the frontline Donbas region remain opposed to any territorial concessions. Despite constant shelling and the hardships of war, locals and soldiers interviewed expressed a strong desire to defend their land, viewing any surrender of territory as a betrayal of those who have died fighting. The sentiment on the ground reflects the immense personal and national cost of the conflict, with many believing that ceding land would only embolden Russia to make further demands in the future.</p>

Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner succeeded in keeping his captain, though the club missed out on a £35 million transfer fee for a player whose contract expires next summer. For Guehi, the failed move is frustrating but also positions him to become a highly sought-after free agent, potentially securing a more lucrative contract. Liverpool, meanwhile, may be left short on defensive cover after failing to secure their target.</p>
