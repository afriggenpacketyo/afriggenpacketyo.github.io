          <p>Elon Musk announced he will significantly reduce his involvement in Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) initiative after Tesla reported a substantial drop in profits and revenue. The decline is attributed to decreased sales and backlash from Musk's political involvement, which included contributing heavily to Trump's re-election campaign. Tesla's Q1 revenue fell short of analyst expectations, impacted by price cuts and tariffs on Chinese parts. Musk's reduced role in Doge is expected to free up his time to focus on Tesla, though the company anticipates continued challenges due to changing political sentiment and trade policies.

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index rising 0.9% year-on-year, primarily driven by increases in food and private transport costs.

The inflation data arrives as Singapore prepares for a general election, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a significant concern. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, reflecting declines in manufacturing and certain service sectors.</p>

          <p>London will host fresh talks between diplomats from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the US to try and secure a ceasefire in the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The US Secretary of State had been expected to attend but pulled out, sending Trump's Ukraine envoy, Gen Keith Kellogg, instead. The talks come amid speculation that Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in return for significant concessions, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Despite claims of an Easter truce, reports suggest there has been no let-up in attacks.</p>
