Authorities believe mental illness may have been a factor, as there is no evidence suggesting political motivation. The suspect allegedly stabbed people waiting for a train between platforms 13 and 14, but two bystanders and emergency services quickly intervened to stop the attack.

          <p>President Donald Trump served as the commencement speaker for this year's U.S. Military Academy graduates at West Point, amidst the administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs within military academies. Since assuming office, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have advocated for significant changes, leading to the disbanding of student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and the removal of books addressing diversity from U.S. Naval Academy libraries. Former West Point teachers have criticized these actions, arguing they undermine the values and education of the academies. Protests were planned during the ceremony, both outside the academy and on the Hudson River.</p>

          <p>Experts are working to save Floridaâ€™s coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, aiming to reverse the severe decline caused by record ocean heat and climate change. The Florida Keys have lost 90% of their coral cover in the last 40 years. Marine biologists from the Keys Marine Laboratory and the Florida Aquarium have partnered to develop a large-scale restoration project, focusing on the fast-growing and resilient elkhorn coral. The project involves spawning genetically diverse corals and planting them at seven offshore sites, with teams monitoring their progress. This initiative is part of a broader effort involving multiple organizations to restore various coral species.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the U.S. housing market. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, could benefit investors but raises concerns about mortgage market stability. Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee trillions in mortgages, were bailed out during the 2008 recession and placed under federal conservatorship. Critics warn that privatization could increase mortgage rates, while supporters argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers. The administration's decision will hinge on the impact on long-term mortgage rates and market safety.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has obtained a court order to prevent the obstruction of waste vehicles as a bin strike continues, resulting in over 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste. The council believes industrial action by pickets has disrupted collections, while Unite, representing the workers, asserts their actions are lawful and peaceful. The dispute centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with negotiations ongoing for 11 weeks. Unite criticizes government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress and calls for a fair offer to avoid financial hardship for workers.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is facing scrutiny over its commitment to climate protection. Katherina Reiche, the new Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, plans to amend the Building Energy Act, potentially weakening its focus on heat pumps. While the government has committed to a large infrastructure investment program with â‚¬100 billion allocated to climate protection, critics are concerned about the emphasis on gas-fired power plants. Energy expert Claudia Kemfert argues that the gas plans are oversized, suggesting alternatives like hydropower and batteries.</p>
