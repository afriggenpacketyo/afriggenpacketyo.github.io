          <p>North Korea has successfully raised a capsized 5,000-ton naval destroyer, which had been damaged during a failed missile launch in May, according to state media. Leader Kim Jong Un has set a deadline for the ship's repairs to be completed this month, viewing it as a crucial asset.

The ship is North Korea's second known destroyer and is reportedly capable of carrying various weapons, including nuclear missiles, potentially developed with Russian assistance. The article indicates a focus on repairing and maintaining military capabilities in North Korea.

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The Tokyo High Court reversed a district court's decision that had required the executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The focal point of the appeal trial was whether the management's decisions on tsunami countermeasures were appropriate after a TEPCO unit estimated a potential tsunami height in 2008. The acquittals of two executives in a related criminal suit were finalized earlier in the year, indicating a complex legal landscape surrounding the disaster.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as the chairman of Reform UK, stating that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time." His resignation follows criticism of a Reform MP's call to ban the burka, and reports suggest some found Yusuf difficult to work with. Yusuf, a former Conservative, had been instrumental in the party's recent electoral successes and was spearheading initiatives to cut wasteful spending in councils. His departure raises questions about the party's stability and future direction, with mixed reactions from party members and political opponents.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the issue of young offenders being denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention, meaning the time doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face at the conclusion of their court case. In many states, there's no such thing as time credit in juvenile delinquency cases, which adds months to the duration that kids are confined away from their families. This practice raises concerns about the lopsided application of fundamental rights and disparities between how young people are treated in different states.

          <p>The Labour government is promising to introduce rules which would mandate developers to add solar panels to all new builds. Builders will be required to fit solar panels to the "vast majority" of new build homes in England under changes to be published this year, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said. The Home Builders Federation said it backed fitting more panels but cautioned against introducing "burdensome" paperwork which it said could harm government efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced his department will impose sanctions on four judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for "illegitimate" targeting of Israel and the US. The measures require all property and interests owned by the judges in the US to be blocked and reported to the Treasury department. The sanctions are in response to the ICC issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu, and its investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan. The article highlights the ongoing tensions between the US and the ICC over the court's investigations and actions.</p>
