          <p>Kent International, a four-generation U.S. bicycle company, is halting imports from China due to President Trump's tariffs. The company had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and parts, but a recent shipment incurred a combined 181.47% duty. This has led to $3.1 million in tariffs in one month, forcing the cancellation of new orders from China. The company is finding it financially untenable to fully manufacture in the U.S. due to high production costs, with one example being handlebar production costing significantly more domestically.

          <p>India conducted strikes on Pakistan in response to a militant attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, escalating tensions between the two nuclear powers. The Indian government stated that its forces targeted nine sites used by militants, while Pakistan reported at least eight deaths and accused India of an unprovoked act of war. Global leaders have warned of potentially dire consequences if the conflict escalates further, with both countries bracing for potential retaliation. The strikes mark a significant escalation, as India has targeted locations outside the contested Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>China, a major aluminium producer, relies heavily on imported bauxite due to a lack of high-quality domestic ore. A plant in Shanxi province is upgrading to use French technology developed by Yves Ocello from IB2 to process low-grade bauxite, which was previously unusable. This technology neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing the Bayer process to refine high-silica bauxite efficiently. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement this greener aluminium production method, aligning with Beijing's plan for a more environmentally friendly industry.</p>

          <p>During an Oval Office meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphatically stated that Canada is "not for sale" in response to President Trump's repeated suggestions of the U.S. acquiring Canada.

Carney countered by emphasizing the value of the partnership between the two nations and urging Trump to stop referring to Canada as the 51st state. Trade discussions will continue, with both leaders acknowledging the complex nature of negotiations.</p>

          <p>The family of Raymond Lavalle, who was killed in a car-on-pedestrian crash involving a Downey police officer, is suing the city, alleging a cover-up. The family claims the officer knowingly fled the scene, while the city asserts the officer was unaware a person had been hit while pursuing a suspect. The district attorney's office declined to file criminal charges, but the family alleges the officer was speeding and failed to render aid, prompting the lawsuit seeking compensatory and punitive damages.</p>

          <p>Burger King is facing a class action lawsuit alleging that its Whopper advertisements exaggerate the size of the burger compared to what customers actually receive. The lawsuit claims the Whopper appears 35% larger in ads and contains more than twice the actual amount of meat. A judge ruled that it is plausible some consumers could be misled, while Burger King denies the claims, stating the patties are the same in ads and in restaurants. Subway is facing a similar lawsuit over misleading ads for its Steak & Cheese sandwich.</p>

          <p>A Canadian retailer, Luke Therrien, CEO of his company, is forging direct ties with Chinese suppliers, bypassing US middlemen due to trade tensions, stock shortages, and tariffs. This shift involves navigating logistical hurdles but aims for a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain. As trade tensions deepen, businesses are finding new ways to source products, moving purchasing outside the US to find direct players. The trade war is reshaping global supply chains, influencing how goods are sourced, traded, and moved across borders.</p>
