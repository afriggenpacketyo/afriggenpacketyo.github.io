          <p>A man working as a Chuck E. Cheese mascot was arrested in Tallahassee, Florida, for allegedly stealing a customer's debit card. The victim conducted her own investigation, identifying the employee from security footage at a store where the card was used. Police apprehended the 41-year-old suspect at the restaurant, finding the stolen card in his pocket while he was still in costume. He now faces felony charges for larceny and the fraudulent use of the debit card.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal fraught with political accusations. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have suggested the approval was linked to Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump. The approval also follows Skydance's commitment to address conservative grievances and eliminate diversity initiatives, a move that the FCC's lone Democrat commissioner argued erodes press freedom. The article also highlights a recent "South Park" episode that satirized the situation.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending on artificial intelligence, but are actually underspending. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and recent strong earnings from Alphabet justify increased capital expenditures in the field. Despite acknowledging current flaws in AI chatbots, Cramer believes these investments are crucial for developing superior technology that could lead to near-monopoly profits, similar to Google's dominance in search.

It explains that grand jury testimony is legally protected and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances, which would have been a high bar to clear. Furthermore, releasing raw investigative material outside of a criminal proceeding is highly unusual for the FBI due to privacy concerns and the protection of ongoing investigations.

          <p>Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer of the tech company Astronomer, has resigned from her position. Her departure follows the resignation of the company's CEO, Andy Byron, last week. The resignations occurred after a video went viral from a Coldplay concert, allegedly showing the two executives embracing before abruptly hiding from the arena's large screen camera. The clip sparked widespread speculation and media attention, leading the company to launch an internal investigation and place the CEO on leave before he ultimately resigned.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is launching a test of 10 new beverages inspired by its recently shuttered CosMc's drink-focused spinoff chain. The new lineup, which includes cold coffees and fruity refreshers, will be available in 500 U.S. restaurants, starting in Wisconsin, Colorado, and surrounding areas. The move is a strategic effort to capitalize on the growing demand for cold, flavorful drinks, particularly among Gen Z customers. This test represents a shift from operating standalone stores to integrating successful concepts directly into the main McDonald's menu to boost sales and customer engagement.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "absolutely convinced" that Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections, despite historical trends of the president's party losing seats. He based his optimism on the number of Democratic-held seats in districts that President Trump won in 2024 and demographic shifts favoring the GOP. Johnson also defended the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," predicting its tax cuts and other provisions will act as "jet fuel" for the economy and that voters will feel the benefits. He dismissed polling that shows public disapproval of the law.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated that she did not find the complainant's evidence to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The high-profile trial centered on whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, had consented to subsequent sexual acts with the other four who entered the room. The players' lawyers argued they believed consent was given, while the woman testified she was intoxicated and fearful.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing powerful laser weapons. This synthetic crystal, measuring 60mm in diameter, can efficiently convert lasers into mid- to far-infrared beams capable of long-distance transmission through the atmosphere. The material can reportedly withstand immense laser power, potentially overcoming a long-standing obstacle where lasers damage their own components. This breakthrough could enable the development of ground-based laser systems powerful enough to disable satellites in orbit.</p>

The administration argues these grants, related to topics like gender identity and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), do not align with its policy objectives. A lower federal court had previously blocked the cancellations, ordering the NIH to reinstate the funding and finding the agency engaged in "no reasoned decision-making."

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit claims these policies intentionally obstruct federal immigration enforcement and endanger public safety by preventing the transfer of non-citizen criminals. The action comes amid heightened rhetoric from the administration, with border czar Tom Homan vowing to "flood the zone" with immigration agents in sanctuary cities. A spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams stated the city will review the lawsuit, defending the laws' intent while acknowledging they may go too far.</p>

A key example cited is the recent withholding of billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools. The piece examines the broader implications of these actions, questioning what the administration's drastically altered approach to the federal government's role in education means for classrooms across the United States.</p>
