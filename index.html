          <p>Following a knife attack in Hamburg, where a Syrian teenager, Muhammad al-Muhammad, helped stop the assailant, manipulated images and false narratives spread online, fueled by right-wing sentiments. These images, some AI-generated, aimed to discredit al-Muhammad's heroism and sow distrust in the media's portrayal of the event. Experts warn that such disinformation undermines democracy by creating alternative realities and eroding trust in established institutions. The Hamburg police confirmed al-Muhammad's involvement, countering claims that he did not exist or play a significant role, thus emphasizing the importance of verifying information and being critical of online content, as it has the potential to manipulate perceptions of the event and the individuals involved.</p>

          <p>CPAC, the US Conservative Political Action Conference, held large gatherings in Poland and Hungary, aiming to reshape the European project with a brand of conservativism. Speakers, including Viktor Orban and Alice Weidel, criticized the EU's Green Deal and complained about immigration and "gender and woke madness." The movement seeks to establish a global platform for anti-globalist forces, with Orban positioning Budapest as the intellectual capital of dissident European conservatism. The conference underscored the influence of the Trump administration in supporting nationalist leaders in Europe, though recent electoral setbacks highlight the challenges faced by the Maga movement in gaining widespread acceptance.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of undermining the next round of peace talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul, citing Moscow's failure to provide negotiating proposals. President Zelensky stated that for the meeting to be meaningful, the agenda must be clear and the negotiations properly prepared, while reaffirming Ukraine's readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire. Both sides reported explosions in various regions, raising concerns about the commitment to de-escalation. Despite previous prisoner of war swaps, significant progress towards resolving the conflict remains elusive.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing migrants are appealing to the court to halt President Trump's utilization of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law rarely invoked, as a central component of his aggressive deportation strategy. This legal challenge marks the beginning of a potentially decisive battle over the president's attempts to employ the act. The lawyers argue that using this act against migrants is an overreach of executive power and violates due process. The outcome of this legal battle will significantly impact the administration's immigration policies and the rights of migrants.</p>

Experts argue that the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, reducing transparency and potentially harming low-income families who rely on these funds. While the US is a major source of remittances for Africa, the tax could disproportionately affect countries where remittances make up a large percentage of GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An inquest is underway in Australia to examine the circumstances that allowed Joel Cauchi, a man with a history of mental illness, to carry out a mass stabbing at a Sydney shopping center. The inquiry is focusing on Cauchi's interactions with police and mental health professionals in the years leading up to the attack, seeking to identify missed opportunities for intervention. Families of the victims have shared emotional testimonies, highlighting the devastating impact of the tragedy. The inquest aims to determine if Australia can prevent similar incidents in the future by addressing systemic failures in mental health care and security protocols.</p>
