          <p>President Trump used his Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery to touch on political themes, referencing his efforts to "fix" the nation after a challenging four years. He criticized the previous administration's border security policies and promised future improvements for the country. Trump's remarks followed a traditional wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. His earlier social media posts included both a generic holiday message and criticisms of political opponents and judges, drawing attention to immigration issues and perceived injustices. The article provides context around the somber occasion juxtaposed with Trump's characteristic political messaging.</p>

          <p>President Trump has strongly condemned President Putin for the recent escalation of attacks on Ukrainian cities, labeling his actions as "absolutely crazy." Trump expressed his disapproval of Putin's defiance of ceasefire efforts and the resulting loss of life. He indicated he would consider further sanctions against Russia. The remarks followed a significant Russian aerial assault on Ukraine, resulting in numerous casualties and widespread damage, prompting international concern and renewed discussions about potential responses to the ongoing conflict.

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the United States. This move follows his previous actions to block Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze federal funding due to alleged anti-semitism on campus. Harvard has filed lawsuits in response to these actions, claiming they are unlawful and retaliatory. The White House has also targeted other universities, withdrawing federal funding from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell University, in an effort to enforce compliance with the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests the "true rate" of unemployment is significantly higher than the official rate, standing at 24.3% in April compared to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 4.2%. LISEP's measure includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time work but unable to find it, and individuals in poverty-wage jobs. This broader metric aims to capture labor market nuances missed by traditional indicators, highlighting those left behind during economic expansion. The report reveals disparities across race and gender, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers experiencing higher rates of functional unemployment.</p>

          <p>Democrats are reportedly moving away from using 'woke' jargon in an attempt to win back voters who previously supported Donald Trump.

Some Democrats are advocating for simpler language to connect with a broader electorate and avoid appearing out of touch. The shift comes after criticism of Kamala Harris's use of complex and confusing language during the 2024 presidential election.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision of a world order where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. This concept echoes 19th-century imperial rule, with Trump expressing desires to expand American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Critics point to his praise of leaders like Putin and Xi, as well as potential deals involving Ukrainian territory, as evidence of this approach. However, some observers caution against attributing strategic intent to Trump's actions, suggesting he lacks a cohesive vision of a world order.</p>

Alternatives to high-interest loans include personal loans from banks, reduced interest rates on credit cards, and assistance from family members. Building an emergency fund through side gigs and exploring debt consolidation options can also help break the cycle. Enrolling in a debt management plan (DMP) through a nonprofit counseling agency can consolidate debts and reduce interest rates, though it may temporarily lower credit scores.
