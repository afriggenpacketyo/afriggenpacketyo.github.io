          <p>The Senate, in a 51-48 vote, passed a resolution to block President Trump's tariffs on Canada.  Four Republican senators joined Democrats, defying Trump's pressure.  The vote represents a significant bipartisan rebuke of Trump's escalating trade war and highlights concerns about the economic impact on American families and businesses. This action directly counters Trump's stated trade policies and his declared national emergency.</p>
