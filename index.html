          <p>Russell Martin's tumultuous 17-game tenure as Rangers head coach has concluded with his sacking, following widespread fan discontent and a poor start to the season. His departure was marked by a chaotic scene where he required a police escort after a draw at Falkirk.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week, beginning with its engine factory in Wolverhampton, after a major cyber-attack forced a widespread shutdown of its global operations.
