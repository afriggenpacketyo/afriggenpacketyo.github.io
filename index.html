          <p>A new study challenges the assumption that wealth is the primary driver of happiness, suggesting that factors like strong relationships, community involvement, and a sense of purpose play a more significant role. While the World Happiness Report typically ranks wealthy Nordic nations at the top, this research, which examined over 200,000 people across 22 countries, found that countries with lower GDPs, such as Indonesia and Nigeria, reported higher overall flourishing scores. The article suggests that prioritizing economic growth above all else may have imposed costs on developed nations, urging a focus on fostering meaning, purpose, and relationships.</p>

          <p>The article examines President Trump's historically lenient stance toward Vladimir Putin and questions whether recent events might lead him to adopt a tougher approach. Despite Trump's efforts to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, Putin has repeatedly defied him. After meeting with Ukraine’s president and witnessing Russian strikes in Kyiv, Trump displayed a rare flash of anger at Moscow. The article explores potential penalties for Russia's behavior, including sanctions and increased weapons shipments to Ukraine, while also noting the divided opinions within Trump's cabinet.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as deputy to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, signaling a potential generational change. The appointment is seen as a step towards overcoming the political stalemate in the West Bank, which has been under Israeli occupation since 1967. The article notes that Palestinians have long been critical of Abbas, and skepticism remains about whether the new succession plan will bring significant change. Hamas reacted coolly to al-Sheikh's appointment, asserting that Palestinians would decide on their leadership independently.</p>

However, after 10 years, access to funds ends, the payment structure changes, and monthly payments increase substantially to include both principal and interest. The article provides advice on how to prepare for the end of the draw period, including making principal payments early and considering refinancing options.</p>
