        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump declared the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications. Trump accused Cook of "gross negligence" and "potentially criminal" conduct, an action that escalates his ongoing criticism of the central bank's independence regarding interest rates. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed's Board of Governors, stated she would gather accurate information to address the claims, which stem from a 2021 mortgage application. The move is likely to face legal challenges, as federal law permits presidential removal of Fed governors only "for cause." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described illegal migration as a "historic and unprecedented scourge" affecting the country, announcing plans to detain and deport those entering the UK illegally. His party proposes significant legal changes, including leaving the European Court of Human Rights and repealing the Human Rights Act, to facilitate these removals. Farage also called for a legal obligation on the Home Secretary to remove illegal arrivals and to ban them from ever claiming asylum. This comes as nearly 28,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year, putting immense pressure on the government to address the escalating situation and restore public order.</p>

Pargas Rodriguez allegedly lured a woman to his workshop in 2021, where he violently assaulted and threatened her with a pistol before she managed to escape. He illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was later released on his own recognizance despite a prior assault arrest, highlighting concerns about immigration enforcement. ICE tracked him down following a Border Patrol tip, and he remains in custody pending immigration proceedings for repatriation to Venezuela to face justice.</p>

          <p>Boeing and Korean Air finalized a deal for 103 aircraft, including 787, 777, and 737 passenger jets, shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with President Trump. This agreement, valued at over $32 billion, is seen as a move to modernize Korean Air's fleet and maintain competitiveness amidst its merger with Asiana Airlines. The deal also aligns with Trump's push for trading partners to increase business with American firms, supporting an estimated 135,000 jobs across the U.S. This marks a significant boost for Boeing, which has faced recent crises and production challenges.

The island's west end was severed by Katrina, and despite some beach restoration efforts, constant maintenance requires millions in funding. Mayor Jeff Collier is pursuing grants, including a now-canceled FEMA program, to protect the community. The Trump administration's termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program, which disproportionately affected Trump-supporting counties, has further complicated funding efforts, leaving communities in limbo.</p>

Trump praised his relationship with Kim and suggested the U.S. could seek ownership of land hosting a large American military base in South Korea, rather than a lease. Despite Trump's claims of reduced missile tests, North Korea has been bolstering its nuclear program and supporting Russia, while ignoring past calls for denuclearization talks.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the agreement, emphasizing that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 prohibits the president from unilaterally withholding congressionally allocated funds.

          <p>The UK government has approved plans for around 40 students from Gaza to travel to the UK to take up funded university scholarships, including nine under the Chevening scheme. This initiative, described as "complex and challenging," would mark the first time Gazan students have left to study in the UK since the Hamas-Israel war began in 2023. Students will undergo visa biometric checks in a third country before arriving, though Israel's approval for each student's departure is still required. This decision follows months of campaigning and coincides with UK plans to evacuate critically ill Gazan children for medical treatment.</p>

This plea comes after U.S. prosecutors waived the death penalty and follows his arrest in Texas last year, reportedly after being ambushed by sons of his former ally, 'El Chapo' Guzmán.

X claims a "zero tolerance" policy for child sexual assault material, but investigations reveal traders are easily creating new accounts after old ones are removed. Experts from the Canadian Centre for Child Protection emphasize that platforms must do more than just remove accounts, as the problem's scale is enormous.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food price inflation has reached an 18-month high of 4.2% in August, up from 4% in July, primarily due to significant increases in the cost of chocolate, butter, and eggs. The British Retail Consortium attributes these rises to high demand, tightening supply, increased labor costs, and poor cocoa harvests exacerbated by climate change and crop disease. While some relief is noted in clothing and stationery prices, overall inflation also increased to 3.8%. This surge in staple food costs is prompting households to reassess budgets, with food prices having risen approximately 37% over the last five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK local authorities are grappling with a spiraling debt of £122 billion, equivalent to £1,700 per resident, leading to a "fire sale" of public assets like schools and care homes. A BBC study reveals that despite curbs on commercial borrowing, council debts grew 7% last year, driven by underfunding and increasing reliance on short-term loans. Councils in financial distress are now granted powers to sell assets to cover day-to-day services, a practice deemed "unsustainable" by experts who warn of eroding "public value." The government acknowledges the "broken" funding system and is pursuing reforms, while some councils call for debt write-offs. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump's supporters view this as visionary diplomacy, while critics see it as "reality TV masquerading as foreign policy."
