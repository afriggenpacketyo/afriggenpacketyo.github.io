        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a temporary tariff truce between the United States and China, the global shipping industry continues to experience significant shifts. Analysts predict a full-year decline in transpacific trade volumes, placing sustained pressure on freight rates, which have already fallen for nine consecutive weeks. Major carriers like Maersk have reported a substantial drop in China-US container volumes. This downturn is prompting a re-routing of trade, with European, Latin American, and Asian markets seeing increased import growth as companies diversify their supply chains away from the ongoing trade dispute.</p>

          <p>A fierce competition is unfolding in China's on-demand delivery sector, with Alibaba's Taobao Shangou service reportedly surpassing Meituan in daily orders after the latter ceased a promotional campaign. This shift highlights the effectiveness of subsidies in the highly competitive Chinese market, moving it from a near-monopoly to a potential duopoly. While Meituan is expected to maintain its lead in food delivery, analysts at Morgan Stanley project that Alibaba could achieve near-equal footing in the broader instant commerce industry by 2030, signaling a significant market realignment.</p>

Despite a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the circulation of USDC grew 90% year-over-year.

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te is facing a significant decline in public approval since taking office, with three recent polls indicating his support has fallen to the low 30s. The surveys show widespread disapproval of his administration's performance, even in his political stronghold of Tainan. This sharp drop in popularity signals potential difficulties for his ruling party in upcoming local elections and the 2028 presidential race. The polls reflect growing public pessimism about the direction of his leadership during his remaining three years in office.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Online Safety Act is facing significant criticism from both domestic users and international observers, including U.S. politicians. The law mandates stringent age verification on platforms with adult content, forcing sites like PornHub, Reddit, and Spotify to request personal data such as IDs or credit card details. This has led to a surge in VPN usage in the UK as users seek to protect their privacy. Concerns are also being raised about the law's potential to chill free expression and create a precedent for internet regulation globally.</p>

          <p>Journalists and activists are protesting in Tirana, Albania, after police forcibly shut down the private news channel News 24. The police operation, which took the station off the air, was based on a court ruling to return the property it occupied to the state for a new defense industry project. The station's owner, Focus Media Group, and press freedom organizations have condemned the move as an arbitrary and politically motivated attack on free speech. The government defends the action, stating the company's lease expired in 2022 and it failed to vacate the premises.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, pausing a potential escalation of their tariff war. This move keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%, averting a return to much higher rates. The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and other economic issues. However, the continued uncertainty has frustrated some business owners who find it difficult to plan for the future.</p>

Gruden's lawyers argued he was not a league employee when the emails were sent and that the NFL's process is unfair.

The disease is frequently misdiagnosed as tuberculosis, a common ailment in the region, leading to lost opportunities for life-saving treatment. Systemic issues like a lack of diagnostic tools, insufficient training for healthcare providers, and poor death registration systems contribute to the problem. While smoking rates are a factor, the crisis highlights a broader failure to address non-communicable diseases as infectious disease rates decline, with Africa's cancer burden expected to double by 2050.</p>

          <p>Tesla has begun taking orders for a new, longer-range version of its Model 3 electric vehicle in China, priced 14% higher than the basic edition. The new variant boasts a driving range of 830km and features a high-performance battery from LG Energy Solution. The launch comes as Tesla faces escalating competition and a recent decline in its mainland China deliveries. This move appears to be a strategy to bolster its position in the premium EV segment of the world's largest automotive market, where it was once the runaway leader.</p>

          <p>While President Trump's rhetoric about crime in Washington D.C. has been criticized as hyperbolic, a deeper look at the data reveals a complex reality. Although violent crime has recently declined, the city's homicide rate remains significantly higher than that of other major U.S. cities like New York and Chicago, and it was rising even before the pandemic. This violence is hyperconcentrated in the city's poorest wards, which have death rates comparable to those of combat zones. This suggests that D.C. has a long-standing and profound violence problem that requires deliberate intervention.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy are experiencing a season of contradictions, simultaneously holding the position of the worst team in Major League Soccer while also being one of the best. The team sits at the bottom of the MLS standings after a disastrous start to their league campaign. However, they have excelled in the Leagues Cup tournament, advancing to the quarterfinals with an unbeaten record against Mexican clubs. This starkly different performance in the two competitions has left analysts and the team's management trying to understand the source of the puzzling inconsistency.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation rate fell for the ninth consecutive month, reaching 1.55% in July, its lowest point since June 2017. The decline was primarily driven by a drop in food prices, providing a positive sign for the nation's economy. This benign inflation outlook, noted by the Reserve Bank of India, could provide the central bank with room for a looser monetary policy to support economic growth. The favorable data comes as India navigates trade tensions and potential tariffs from the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, has expressed skepticism about the upcoming summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.

Kallas emphasized that any viable peace deal requires the involvement of both Europe and Ukraine, which is not expected to be present at the talks.

The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest drop, with the decline concentrated in the hospitality and retail sectors. However, the slowdown is not sharp, as average wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%.

          <p>The upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska highlights a unique chapter in U.S.-Russian history. In 1867, a financially strained Russian Empire sold the territory of Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million. At the time, Russia saw the sale as a way to avoid conflict with Britain and gain cash, while many Americans ridiculed the purchase as a waste of money on a frozen wilderness. The subsequent discovery of gold and oil transformed the acquisition into one of history's greatest bargains, leaving a lasting Russian cultural imprint on the state.</p>

          <p>A recent air rage incident in Nigeria has ignited a national debate over inconsistent enforcement and potential double standards.

However, critics, including a presidential candidate, pointed out that a popular musician who engaged in similar disruptive behavior on a different flight faced no consequences. The disparity has led to accusations of unequal justice and calls for improved coordination among aviation security agencies to ensure fair handling of all such incidents.</p>
