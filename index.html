            <p>The White House claims that a letter sent to Harvard University, outlining demands regarding DEI programs and international student screening, was unauthorized, according to the New York Times. The letter, signed by three federal officials, requested Harvard eliminate DEI initiatives and implement ideological screening for international students. A Harvard spokesperson acknowledged receiving the letter on official letterhead and from a senior federal official's email. The university rejected the White House's demands, risking approximately $9 billion in federal funding, leading the White House to consider freezing around $2.2 billion in grants.</p>

Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar held talks with Taliban officials in Kabul, where concerns about the deportations were raised. Many expelled Afghans claim to have been born in Pakistan and fear life under Taliban rule, particularly regarding education for girls.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced that his administration is taking steps to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections and reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification would affect approximately 50,000 federal workers. The White House claims the change aims to hold government workers to higher standards of conduct and performance, allowing for easier termination if they refuse to advance the President's policy interests or engage in corrupt behavior. The new rule requires an executive order from Trump after OPM issues a final rule.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court order prevents the Trump administration from removing Venezuelans held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that immigration authorities were attempting to restart removals under the Act. The ACLU had sued to block the deportations of two Venezuelans, claiming they were being accused of gang membership without due process.</p>

            <p>Steve Coogan argues that the rise of right-wing populism is fueled by financial security rather than poverty, with affluent voters prioritizing tax cuts and deregulation over social welfare. He suggests that a new social contract is emerging between the wealthy and the state, where the poor are kept out of sight, allowing the affluent to retain their gains. Oxford academics found that financial security reduces risk aversion, making people more tolerant of taking large political risks. Coogan expresses concern about late-stage capitalism leading to households turning inward, benefiting the professional classes and plutocrats.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelan men in immigration custody, following concerns that they were at imminent risk of removal without due process. The ACLU argued that the men were being classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and would be deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The court's order prevents the Trump administration from removing any member of the group until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting.</p>

            <p>An expert emphasizes the importance of strong reading skills in elementary school as a powerful predictor of long-term success for children. Parents who engage in specific activities early on, such as treating baby babble as conversation, asking questions and waiting for answers, discussing letter sounds, playing with words, and seizing readable moments throughout the day, give their children an edge. These practices help build a foundation for language development, vocabulary, and reading comprehension.</p>

            <p>A GOBankingRates analysis reveals that $2 million in retirement savings, combined with Social Security payments, can last from 23 years in Hawaii to 72 years in West Virginia. This disparity is primarily due to differences in the cost of living across states, particularly housing prices. The analysis considered typical retiree expenses, including groceries, housing, transportation, utilities, and health care. While $2 million is a significant amount, it covers more than 35 years of retirement in most states. (not investment advice)</p>

The outcome of the case could have implications for religious freedom and curriculum decisions in public schools.</p>
