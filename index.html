        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian defence ministry said the strikes were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the April 22 attack accountable, while Pakistan has described the strikes as "unprovoked". Pakistan's military claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone, resulting in casualties, while India claims civilian casualties due to Pakistani shelling. Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors remain high as the international community calls for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of monetary policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and reduced reserve requirements for banks, to mitigate the impact of trade tensions with the United States. These steps aim to boost lending and inject liquidity into the economy, supporting sectors like technology and real estate. The announcement coincides with the upcoming trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, signaling Beijing's intent to stabilize markets and bolster economic growth amid global uncertainties. Some analysts believe the measures will have a modest impact due to lackluster demand from borrowers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes an additional two years of imprisonment for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This measure aims to prevent offenders from evading the consequences of their actions and provide a moment of recognition for victims' families. The bill addresses concerns raised after several high-profile cases where killers did not attend sentencing, causing further distress to the victims' families. While some believe the extra jail time is inconsequential for those facing lengthy sentences, others suggest restricting family visits and parole eligibility as potential deterrents.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its 2025 sales growth forecast downward due to weaker-than-expected sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug, despite reporting a first-quarter profit beat. The Danish pharmaceutical giant's net profit surpassed analyst expectations, but Wegovy sales fell slightly short of anticipated figures. The company now anticipates sales growth of 13% to 21% at constant exchange rates for 2025, a reduction from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. The adjustment reflects the impact of drug copycats on Wegovy sales.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that increasing Western military support to India and China's support to Pakistan signals a shift in global alignments and a potential flashpoint for international tensions. The article highlights the redrawing of military alliances in the region, with India increasingly relying on Western arms and Pakistan turning to China. This shift injects superpower politics into the long-standing conflict, raising concerns about escalation and the potential for a catastrophic outcome given the nuclear capabilities of both nations. The United States is now central to India’s security interests, while China increasingly plays a comparable role in Pakistan.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are at odds after Newsom proposed a federal film tax credit to "Make America Film Again." Newsom's request followed Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., aiming to revitalize the nation's movie industry. Trump criticized Newsom's handling of the film industry and the California High-Speed Rail project, while also expressing some fondness for the governor. The exchange highlights the ongoing debate over economic policies and the film industry's future in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, based on the idea that its reserve currency status harms the U.S. economy, is fundamentally flawed. He explains that while the dollar's status influences trade deficits, it is only one of many factors, including fiscal policy and economic strength. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit is a more straightforward solution than initiating a trade war. The analysis underscores the complexities of international trade and the limitations of tariffs as a cure-all.</p>

While the deal is seen as a symbolic victory, it underscores the challenges Ukraine faces in balancing its sovereignty with the need for external support.</p>
