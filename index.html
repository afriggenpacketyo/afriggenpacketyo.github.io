          <p>The Department of Defense's Inspector General is investigating whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally sent text messages containing military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen or if staff members were responsible. The investigation is focused on how classified strike details ended up on the commercial messaging app Signal, and investigators are interviewing current and former staff members. The details were shared in chat groups including Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth's wife, who is not a government employee. Investigators are also looking into whether staff were asked to delete messages, as the government is required to retain federal communications as official records. The probe's findings are expected to be released soon, and Hegseth is scheduled to testify before Democratic lawmakers, who are likely to question him about his handling of sensitive information.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring, reversing cuts made by the council last month. The agreement ensures that council leadership will identify funds for an additional 240 recruits within 90 days, costing $13.3 million for the coming year and about $60 million in 2026-27. Bass thanked the council for coming together on the deal, emphasizing that the budget invests in emergency response, homeless services, street repairs, parks, libraries, and other programs. Restoring the police recruits would bring the number of officers to more than 8,600, addressing concerns about slowing down recruitment at the LAPD.</p>

The National Assembly voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognizing the anti-Semitism he faced. Parliament also passed a law to compensate former returnees from French Indochina who were placed in temporary camps after the end of colonial rule. Additionally, the Assembly adopted a resolution addressing Haiti's "double debt" from 1825, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations, although concrete steps or financial agreements are not included.</p>

This interview precedes a key UN Oceans conference where countries will discuss protecting oceans from plastic pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation. The UN aims to have the High Seas Treaty ratified by 60 countries to protect 30% of the ocean. Bottom trawling, currently allowed in 90% of the UK's Marine Protected Areas, is a major concern, though some fishing communities defend it as an efficient food production method.</p>

          <p>Simone Biles criticized former U.S. swimmer Riley Gaines for advocating the exclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports. Gaines, who filed a lawsuit against the NCAA over transgender swimmer Lia Thomas's participation, has been vocal about her opposition to transgender athletes in women's sports. Biles called Gaines a "sore loser" and suggested she should be uplifting the trans community instead of bullying them. Gaines responded by insinuating that Biles should compete in men's gymnastics and brought up the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced that the government would seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the legality of migrant turnbacks at the border. This decision follows a Berlin court ruling that deemed the refusal to allow three Somali nationals to enter Germany unlawful. The court stated that Germany should have applied the EU's Dublin Regulation before sending the migrants back to Poland. Dobrindt insisted that Germany must crack down on illegal migration to prevent the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from pushing more radical solutions.</p>

El Salvador agreed to release Mr Ábrego García after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. His lawyer called the charges "preposterous".

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly 50% of Americans are making a significant mistake by not saving adequately for retirement, citing his company's "Today's Retirement Crisis" study. The study reveals that 42% of Americans are not currently saving for the future, while only a small fraction save the recommended 15% or more of their income. With Social Security benefits typically replacing just 40% of pre-retirement income, Ramsey emphasizes the importance of creating a savings benchmark and increasing monthly savings. He suggests setting a savings rate significantly higher, recommending 15% of gross income, assuming an emergency fund is already in place and debts are paid off (not investment advice).</p>
