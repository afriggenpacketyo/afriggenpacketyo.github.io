          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending the article argues is more fitting than the original "Sex and the City" conclusion. While the revival series has faced criticism for its writing, it ultimately honors the original show's core theme: the enduring power of female friendship over romantic love. After a series of late-life indignities, including widowhood and a failed romance, Carrie realizes that a life without a male partner is not a tragedy. The finale emphasizes that finding fulfillment in friendships can be more profound than the fairytale romance the original series provided for all its heroines.</p>

          <p>Former Delaware Governor and Congressman Mike Castle, a moderate Republican known for his fiscal conservatism and socially progressive stances, has passed away at the age of 86. During his 18 years in the U.S. House, he was a key figure among centrist Republicans and championed the popular 50 State Quarters Program. Castle, who never lost an election until a 2010 Senate primary, is remembered for his integrity and commitment to public service, having also served as a state lawmaker and lieutenant governor. His career was defined by a willingness to cross party lines on issues like environmental protection and government spending.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group experienced a massive surge in its stock price during its Hong Kong trading debut, with shares soaring to nearly four times their initial public offering price. The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in China's booming pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, which have seen rising valuations throughout the year. Innogen, which develops drugs for diabetes and metabolic diseases, raised approximately $87.2 million. The company's performance follows a trend of successful listings for pre-revenue biotech firms under Hong Kong's specialized Chapter 18A rule, indicating a robust market for pharmaceutical investments.

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite trade pressures from the United States. This expansion was primarily driven by a rebound in net exports, which contributed significantly to the GDP after contracting in the previous quarter. On an annualized basis, the economy expanded by 1%, also beating expectations. The positive economic data comes even as Japan navigated a challenging trade environment, ultimately reaching a deal with the U.S. that imposes a 15% blanket tariff on its exports.

          <p>A 50-year-old man in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, was arrested after repeatedly tormenting his neighborhood by blaring a powerful train horn he had affixed to a palm tree in his yard. The man, Gary Boyadzhyan, described his actions as a "cry for help" related to personal and legal issues that cost him his job. Despite promising police he would stop, he sounded the horn again just hours later, leading to his arrest for disturbing the peace and interfering with an officer. Neighbors expressed a mix of annoyance at the window-rattling blasts and concern for the man's well-being, noting his unusual behavior.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old high school senior, Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, was taken into custody by federal immigration officials in Van Nuys while walking his family's dog. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Guerrero-Cruz, a Chilean national, had overstayed his visa by more than two years. The arrest has sparked concern within the community and from the Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent, who highlighted the poor conditions the student is reportedly facing in detention. This incident adds to the growing fear among immigrant families in Los Angeles amid increased enforcement actions near schools.</p>

Two individuals were exposed to the powder, but no injuries were reported, and officials stated there is no remaining threat to the public.

          <p>Instagram users are expressing frustration and anger after parent company Meta erroneously banned their accounts, often for alleged violations of child sexual exploitation policies. Despite denying a widespread issue, Meta has frequently reinstated accounts after being contacted by the BBC, though sometimes the bans recur without explanation. Users report losing access to cherished photos, suffering business losses, and experiencing profound personal distress over the serious but unfounded accusations. The problem appears linked to the platform's AI moderation tools, with many users finding it impossible to reach a human moderator to resolve their cases.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a technological breakthrough that could significantly enhance its naval power. The runway-independent drone is designed to launch from the decks of various warships, including destroyers and frigates, effectively turning them into small aircraft carriers. A project team behind the drone claims it is far superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones. This innovation would allow for rapid deployment and long-range cruise flights even in rough sea conditions, expanding the operational reach of the Chinese navy.</p>

His comments come as Brazil increases its coordination with China to form a multilateral response to tariffs the U.S. imposed in late July. The tariffs, which target a wide range of Brazilian exports, have prompted affected nations to seek alternative economic partnerships.</p>

Newsom has called for a special election on November 4 to approve a new map, which would only take effect if Texas or another Republican state advances a partisan redistricting plan. The move, dubbed the "election rigging response act," aims to "neuter and neutralize" the Texas proposal and has been framed as a necessary step to defend democracy against partisan gerrymandering efforts championed by Donald Trump.</p>

The survey found that few people who perceive an increase in tipping prevalence consider it a positive development.

The move marks a significant reversal from Humm's previous stance that luxury dining needed to evolve away from meat for sustainability.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains a consistent message of total victory, but this contrasts sharply with growing internal dissent, including protests from hostage families demanding a deal and a secular population calling for his resignation. Opinion polls show that while a majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering, a vocal minority is protesting the humanitarian crisis.

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, praising their courage and emphasizing the importance of their actions. Obama stated that their stand against partisan gerrymandering has prompted responses from other states like California and has helped set the tone for a longer struggle to protect democracy. The Texas Democrats, who have been staying in Illinois to deny the state legislature a quorum, said Obama's support shows that their fight has backing at every level of the party.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, they approach the talks with different primary objectives. For Putin, the meeting itself is a victory, signaling a failure of Western efforts to isolate him and granting him recognition on the world stage. He also seeks to solidify territorial gains in Ukraine. For Trump, the goal is to be seen as a global peacemaker, having promised during his campaign that he could end the war in days. This contrast in priorities sets the stage for a complex negotiation where Putin may leverage Trump's desire for a deal to achieve Russia's strategic aims.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams, at 45 years old, is set to make history as the oldest player to compete in the U.S. Open singles tournament since 1981. Williams, a two-time U.S. Open champion, received a wild card invitation for what will be her 25th appearance in the singles championship. Despite a current singles ranking of 654th following a series of injuries, her participation highlights the longevity seen in professional tennis. Earlier this year, she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004, underscoring her continued presence in the sport.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is planning to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities scheduled for construction, largely within the next five years. This expansion is driven by the growing demand for processing power from artificial intelligence and other digital services. However, concerns are mounting over the immense energy and water these new centres will consume, with some experts warning it could lead to higher utility bills for consumers. Despite environmental objections and the strain on resources, the government considers data centres critical national infrastructure for the UK's economic future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven dubbing system called DeepEditor is helping international films break into the challenging U.S. market by seamlessly altering actors' lip movements to match a new language. Developed by the company Flawless, the technology manipulates video to create the illusion that actors are genuinely speaking the dubbed language, overcoming the awkwardness of traditional dubbing. The system was successfully used on the Swedish sci-fi film "Watch the Skies," enabling a theatrical release in the U.S. that would have been otherwise unlikely. This innovation could significantly expand the global audience for foreign-language films and television shows.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is being viewed as a hastily arranged meeting, contrasting sharply with the meticulously planned U.S.-Soviet summits of the past. There is concern among observers that Trump, who has previously sided with Putin over his own intelligence agencies, may be outmaneuvered by the experienced Russian leader. While past summits focused on arms treaties, this meeting centers on ending the war in Ukraine. European leaders have been advising Trump, but his unpredictable style leaves the outcome uncertain, with fears he may prioritize a quick deal over Ukraine's long-term security.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, it faces mounting financial pressures and declining public confidence. The program, which provides benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to see its trust funds depleted by 2034, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if no action is taken. This is due to outgoings consistently outpacing income as the population ages. While President Trump has vowed not to cut the program, his administration's staffing reductions at the Social Security Administration have raised concerns about the agency's ability to serve its growing number of recipients.</p>

He contrasted the current environment with the dot-com bubble, noting that while some recent IPOs and speculative stocks show irrational gains, strong fundamentals from major companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly provide stability. Cramer suggests that the market's "magical thinking" phase affects both speculative and fundamentally sound stocks, and investors should not sell their positions in rational companies due to widespread irrationality.

Commissioners cited significant concerns about the environmental impact of sonic booms on people, wildlife, and property, as well as inadequate monitoring programs. The decision highlights a growing conflict between the state regulatory body and SpaceX, which operates as a federal contractor. It remains unclear what effect the vote will have, as federal activities can often proceed without state permits, though the commission hopes to persuade the Air Force to address its concerns.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their meeting in Alaska, this article reviews past encounters between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, highlighting their contrasting styles and the often-unpredictable nature of their relationship. Past meetings, such as the 2018 Helsinki summit, generated controversy when Trump appeared to side with Putin over U.S. intelligence. Former officials note Putin's meticulous preparation and use of lengthy monologues, contrasting with Trump's more spontaneous and less detail-oriented approach. Experts suggest Putin will likely use his KGB training to try and manipulate Trump, who believes a strong personal relationship is key to state-to-state relations.</p>

This move is a direct response to Chinese competitors like Xiaomi, whose advanced EVs could dominate the market if not for current U.S. tariffs.
