        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new wave of tariffs effective October 1, targeting a range of imported goods to protect U.S. manufacturers. The measures include a 100% levy on branded pharmaceuticals unless the company is building a factory in the U.S., a 50% tax on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, and a 25% duty on heavy-duty trucks. This policy expands on the administration's broader protectionist trade strategy, which has drawn criticism from business groups and economists who warn of potential price increases for American consumers and disruptions to global supply chains.

          <p>Senior officials from the United States and China met in New York and agreed to increase communication to better manage their strategic differences. During the candid talks, China's vice-foreign minister reiterated that the issue of Taiwan is purely an internal affair, urging the U.S. to adhere to the one-China policy. In response, the U.S. deputy secretary of state called for concrete action from Beijing to address the fentanyl crisis and to cooperate on the repatriation of undocumented Chinese nationals, highlighting key areas of friction between the two global powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities across the world are facing a significant increase in rat infestations, a phenomenon some are calling "ratmageddon." Experts attribute the population boom primarily to climate change, as warmer winters allow rats, which do not hibernate, to breed more successfully throughout the year. This environmental factor is compounded by human behavior, including increased waste from fast food consumption and less frequent garbage collection, creating a perfect storm for the resilient pests to thrive and presenting a growing public health challenge.</p>

          <p>A large-scale search operation is underway in Hawaii for 44-year-old diver Bryson Higashi, who was last seen on Tuesday near Hanalei Bay, Kauai. The U.S. Coast Guard, along with the Kauai Police and Fire Departments, initiated the search after Higashi's truck was discovered left unattended for a full day. The multi-agency effort involves boats, a helicopter, and an airplane, but is being conducted under challenging weather conditions, including strong winds, high seas, and reduced visibility due to showers, complicating the search for the missing man.</p>

          <p>Sir Tony Blair, the former UK Prime Minister, has reportedly been involved in high-level discussions about leading a transitional authority in Gaza in the event of a ceasefire. The proposal, which has been discussed by U.S. President Trump and Arab leaders, suggests a UN-backed body with support from Gulf nations to govern the territory before it is returned to Palestinian control. While Blair's office has not confirmed his potential leadership role, the talks signify a concerted international effort to plan for the post-conflict future of the region.</p>

          <p>Rangers manager Russell Martin is facing intense scrutiny following the team's 1-0 Europa League defeat to Genk, which marked their fourth loss in the last seven games.

It details how China's government utilizes a comprehensive process to create detailed five-year plans that guide national strategy on everything from industrial policy to consumer-led growth. In contrast, the U.S. system, which relies on the "invisible hand" of the market and a politically polarized federal budgeting process, is depicted as lacking a cohesive, forward-looking economic framework, particularly under the current administration.</p>

          <h2>Parents of Missing Girl Criticize Reopening of Camp Mystic After Deadly Flood</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The parents of an 8-year-old girl who remains missing after a catastrophic flood at Camp Mystic in Texas have condemned the camp's decision to reopen as "unthinkable." The summer camp, where a flash flood killed 27 people in July, recently announced plans to reopen a sister site in 2026. In an open letter, the parents, along with other affected families, criticized the announcement as deeply insensitive, especially given that recovery teams are still searching the river for their daughter's body.</p>

          <p>China is preparing to open what is being described as the world's highest bridge, located in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. The structure, which crosses the deep Huajiang Grand Canyon, features a bridge deck that stands 625 meters (2,050 feet) above the river below, a height comparable to China's tallest skyscraper. This engineering marvel, with a total length of 2,890 meters, will also be the world's longest mountain bridge, further establishing the region as a global center for ambitious infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>A former Orange County sheriff's deputy, Arcadio Rodriguez, will serve no jail time after pleading guilty to three misdemeanor charges for the sexual assault of two female inmates. The assaults, which occurred while the women were incarcerated, involved unwanted touching over their clothes. The District Attorney expressed frustration with the outcome, stating that current California law prevented prosecutors from filing felony charges because the assault was not skin-to-skin, and called for legal reforms to impose harsher penalties for such abuses of power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the historical context of James Comey's indictment, tracing the origins of his antagonistic relationship with Donald Trump to the 2016 presidential election. It revisits Comey's controversial public statements regarding the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, a move many believe influenced the election's outcome. The narrative continues through his 2017 firing by Trump, which directly led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, framing the current charges as the culmination of a long and deeply personal political conflict.</p>

          <p>An anonymous activist group has been denied a permit to reinstall its satirical statue of President Trump holding hands with convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein on the National Mall. The 12-foot sculpture, titled "Best Friends Forever," was removed by the National Park Service less than 24 hours after its initial appearance, with officials citing a height discrepancy in the permit. The subsequent denial of a new permit, provided without a clear reason, has prompted the creators to raise concerns about free speech and potential political censorship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a stark warning about a more than 460% surge in infections caused by a menacing, drug-resistant bacteria between 2019 and 2023. This "superbug," known as NDM-CRE, is resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics available, making infections extremely difficult to treat. Public health officials are concerned that the rapid increase threatens to cause more severe illnesses and deaths, as treatment options are severely limited and the bacteria can spread easily within healthcare facilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis posits that the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is more than just personal retribution by President Trump; it represents a test of a forward-looking strategy to use the justice system against political opponents. The article argues that this move, coupled with recent rhetoric about investigating donors to anti-Trump causes, is part of a broader plot to deter opposition and undermine democratic processes ahead of future elections. It frames the prosecution not just as an attack on one individual, but as a threat to the rule of law and accountability.</p>
