          <p>Procter & Gamble plans to reduce its global workforce by up to 7,000 jobs, approximately 6%, over the next two years. This decision comes as the company faces challenges related to tariff-related costs and increased consumer anxiety about the economy. The cuts will primarily affect non-manufacturing roles, representing about 15% of that workforce, as part of a broader restructuring program that includes ending sales of certain products in specific markets. The company anticipates providing further details regarding these changes in July, as it aims to ensure its ability to meet long-term financial goals amid current economic headwinds.

Wright stated that the team will assess conditions and previous performances before making a final decision two days before the Test match in Leeds. With Bethell's impressive performance in New Zealand and the West Indies, his inclusion adds depth and flexibility to the squad, making the final selection a difficult but positive challenge for the selectors. </p>

The report emphasizes financial resources as a key factor in the US's competitive edge, distinguishing it from other assessments that focus solely on research output. While China is rapidly closing the gap, the US maintains its position due to its robust investment and innovation infrastructure. </p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh in on the Importance of Best Friendships for Children</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are discussing the role and importance of best friendships for children, emphasizing that while close friendships can be beneficial, they are not essential for every child's well-being. Clinical psychologist Eileen Kennedy-Moore notes that children with best friends tend to be less anxious and more engaged in school. However, educational psychologist Michele Borba suggests that children need a variety of supportive relationships rather than relying solely on one best friend. Teens report feeling pressure to have a best friend, but experts agree that having reliable people to turn to is more important than adhering to a specific label or relationship structure. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England has announced plans to extend free school meals to an additional 500,000 children from September 2026. Any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible, regardless of their income, saving parents £500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The move has been welcomed by education unions and child poverty action groups, though some argue the government needs to go further, with some also calling for the abolishment of the two-child benefit cap in the next spending review. The Department for Education has allocated £1 billion to fund the change up to 2029. </p>

          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary debate saw Andrew Cuomo face criticism from rivals on his record, with much of the night spent sparring with Zohran Mamdani. The candidates agreed on the need to stand up to Donald Trump's administration if elected, but differed on who was best equipped to do so. Cuomo was questioned on his administration's handling of nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations, with his biggest regret being “the state of the Democratic party”. The candidates also pledged to fight Trump’s immigration crackdown in various ways. </p>

          <p>The Atlantic publishes an op-ed arguing that while Donald Trump's approach to dismantling DEI and affirmative action is harmful, racial preferencing in university admissions and employment has become unfair. The author suggests that affirmative action, initially intended to address historical injustices, has evolved into a system that often benefits the already privileged and fosters resentment. They propose a shift towards class-based affirmative action as a more equitable solution. While acknowledging the need to address disparities, the author cautions against Trump's broader assault on civil rights laws and norms. </p>

The piece contrasts this experience with recent events, such as a Christian prayer service at the Pentagon led by a top military leader, and new laws requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Texas classrooms.

The ONS has apologized for the error and stated that it will use correctly weighted data from May 2025 onward.
