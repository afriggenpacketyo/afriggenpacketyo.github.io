          <p>A report by the National Audit Office reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, yet the quality of care remains inadequate. Councils are spending large sums on each child placed in care, but many children are not receiving appropriate support. The report highlights a dysfunctional market driven by profit, where private providers cherry-pick children based on their needs and potential profit. The Department for Education acknowledges the need for reform and plans to address profiteering in care homes. The score is 30.</p>
