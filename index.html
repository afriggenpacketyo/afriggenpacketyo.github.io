          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from proceeding with large-scale reorganizations and workforce reductions across numerous federal agencies. Judge Susan Illston emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress holds the authority to create, fund, and assign duties to federal agencies through statutes. The judge ruled that the administration's actions disregarded congressional mandates and that a president cannot initiate executive branch reorganizations without congressional partnership, protecting thousands of jobs at agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services. The order halts further reductions in force for the duration of the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Facing pressure from President Trump to increase defense spending, NATO allies are considering redefining what qualifies as security to meet his demands. Some countries have tentatively agreed to a plan that would broaden NATO spending beyond traditional military items to include infrastructure and technology. The proposal involves a target of 3.5% of GDP for military spending, plus 1.5% for defense-related spending like strengthening cybersecurity and improving infrastructure to support military operations. This approach aims to satisfy Trump's demands while addressing logistical preparedness highlighted by the war in Ukraine, where weak infrastructure has impeded troop and equipment deployment, according to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple products manufactured outside the U.S. and a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, citing trade imbalances.

Meanwhile, the House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to fund Trump's domestic agenda, which will now move to the Senate for further consideration.

          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a significant rally following reports that President Trump plans to sign executive orders aimed at bolstering the nuclear industry. The orders are expected to expedite the construction of nuclear reactors and secure vital materials for the sector. Trump is reportedly invoking the Defense Production Act to address U.S. dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium and nuclear fuel processing. The president is also expected to direct federal agencies to streamline the permitting and siting of new nuclear facilities, potentially opening federal land for nuclear deployment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has largely reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, following a Pentagon review that used standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. However, the Pentagon's standardized search terms led to the identification of only about 20 books that required further review by a Department of Defense panel. As a result, nearly all of the originally pulled books have been returned to circulation, according to a defense official.</p>

          <p>Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) can be a useful tool for homeowners this summer if used wisely, offering flexibility in accessing funds for various needs. Experts recommend using HELOCs to take advantage of falling interest rates, consolidate credit card debt, and fund home repairs or renovations, as these can increase home value. However, they advise against using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as these carry risk and may not generate financial returns. While HELOCs can be considered for college costs or buying a new home, it's essential to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being seen as a leader of a global right-wing populist movement, President Trump's recent foreign policy decisions suggest otherwise. While some leaders, like Hungary's Viktor OrbÃ¡n and Argentina's Javier Milei, have aligned with the Trump-era American right, Trump's administration hasn't consistently favored countries led by like-minded politicians. Trump's approach is driven more by transactional interests than political affinity, as demonstrated by his dealings with Middle Eastern monarchs and imposition of tariffs on countries led by both right-leaning and leftist governments. Even OrbÃ¡n has shown frustration with Trump's pressure to decouple from China, highlighting the limitations of ideological alignment in international relations.</p>

          <p>During a severe ocean heat wave in 2023, scientists discovered that clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea exhibited a unique adaptation: they shrank in size. Researchers measuring the fish monthly found that most got shorter, likely as a survival mechanism in response to the hotter temperatures. The study suggests that being smaller may help clownfish survive in a warming climate, with those that shrank having a higher chance of survival. This finding adds complexity to the understanding of how marine life responds to climate change, particularly in the face of devastating coral reef damage from heat waves.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the ban, which revokes Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, violates the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The administration claims the ban is a response to Harvard's tolerance of "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" on campus. The university asserts that the ban would erase a quarter of its student body and destabilize its existence, as it relies on international students for its mission and research.</p>

          <p>The latest Mission: Impossible film, The Final Reckoning, marks a shift in the franchise by focusing on Ethan Hunt's character development and backstory, a departure from his previous portrayal as a cipher. While the film includes the series' signature elements like globe-trotting and action stunts, it struggles to balance these with the need to explain the importance of Hunt's actions. The Hunt-heaviness stems from the decision to create lasting consequences for the protagonist's actions, which has saved the series but also leaves the film feeling encumbered. The film's triumphalism about Hunt's character ultimately leaves the viewer a little cold, as the most entertaining aspects of Mission: Impossible were never the overarching plot.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a policy of terminating the immigration court cases of certain migrants in order to arrest them and place them in a fast-tracked deportation process, according to government officials and attorneys. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is asking immigration judges to dismiss cases, allowing agents to arrest the migrants and place them in "expedited removal." Unlike immigration court proceedings, which can take years, expedited removal allows for quicker deportation if migrants lack proper documents and cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years. Critics argue this process circumvents due process and places vulnerable individuals at risk.</p>

          <p>Economists are expressing concern that President Trump's trade policies and tax cuts could push the U.S. into a debt crisis. The combination of growth-inhibiting tariffs and deficit-expanding tax cuts may create a situation where the interest rate on government debt exceeds the economic growth rate. Rising interest rates, coupled with slowing growth, could lead to a vicious cycle of increasing debt-servicing costs and reduced investment. Some economists warn of a potential "bank run" on the Treasury market if investors lose confidence in U.S. debt, potentially leading to a severe economic crisis.</p>
