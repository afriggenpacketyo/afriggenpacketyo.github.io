          <p>The Chinese aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong conducted exercises in the western Pacific Ocean beyond the second island chain, marking an unprecedented display of naval power, according to the Japanese defence ministry. The Shandong strike group was observed performing take-off and landing operations southwest of Iwo Jima, while the Liaoning group was located southwest of Minamitori Island, operating its ship-borne air wings. These islands are part of Japan's Ogasawara Islands, which, along with other Pacific archipelagos, form a strategic band known as the second island chain. The Liaoning group notably ventured further east than Guam, representing the first time a Chinese navy carrier has reached beyond this strategic demarcation. The movement signifies China's growing naval capabilities and its intent to project power further into the Pacific region. </p>

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could prompt foreign investors to withdraw from U.S. stock markets. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the bill, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with unfair taxes, inadvertently impacts foreign investments in U.S. equities. The ICI argues that Section 899 could lead to capital outflows, depressing U.S. equity markets and harming both U.S. companies and investors. Foreign investors hold significant assets in U.S. markets, including stocks, government bonds, and credit, and the ICI supports protecting U.S. business interests but believes the bill's current draft is counterproductive.

          <p>Disorder broke out in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, with masked individuals throwing objects at police and setting houses on fire. Jim Allister, a local MP, described the violence as unwarranted, noting the context of demographic changes in the area due to immigration. The unrest occurred after two teenage boys appeared in court, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl in Ballymena, with the defendants speaking through a Romanian interpreter and denying the charges. Hundreds participated in a peaceful march earlier in the day, before the violence escalated later in the evening. The MP expressed distress over the events taking place in his constituency.</p>

Sheriff Chad Bianco criticized Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly encouraging the riots and not taking appropriate action.

Bianco stated that the agitators are attempting to violently influence political action, which he believes is against the principles of a civilized society.

          <p>China's restrictions on rare earth exports are beginning to affect Western defense giants, particularly after hitting the automotive and robotics industries. As U.S. and Chinese officials resume trade talks, the White House has signaled a willingness to ease chip export controls if Beijing increases rare earth exports. Rare earth elements are crucial in modern defense technologies, such as radar systems and fighter jet construction, making access essential for U.S. national security. The restrictions, imposed in response to U.S. tariffs, require firms to apply for export licenses, creating production challenges for Western companies. The situation underscores the strategic importance of critical minerals and the need for diversified supply chains.</p>

This statement comes after Washington issued warnings to firms using Chinese-made AI semiconductors, particularly Huawei's Ascend chips, due to potential export control violations. Ren insisted that the United States had exaggerated Huawei's achievements, despite facing tougher competition from local players due to restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to Chinese firms. Ren emphasized focusing on getting the job done and moving forward, despite external challenges and restrictions. The company has been diversifying its growth strategy due to sanctions since 2019 which have curtailed its access to US-made components and technologies.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the released rice to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks. The government is distributing the rice to smaller supermarket chains and specialty shops, as well as major retailers, to ensure it reaches consumers at lower prices. The price uptrend has persisted due to suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers.</p>

The government aims to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women to participate in decision-making across various fields. A basic policy on gender equality and women's empowerment focuses on local economies and small businesses, amid a trend of female brain drain in rural areas.

          <p>UK companies are holding back on hiring or replacing departing workers, leading to a decline in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate increased. Feedback from surveys suggests some firms may be holding back from recruiting new workers due to rising employment costs. The figures also showed that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years, with economists predicting it could rise higher. The rise in average wages slowed to 5.2% between February and April, but remains above the rate of inflation.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) resumed taking online orders for clothing lines on Tuesday after a 46-day disruption caused by a cyberattack. The retailer restarted standard home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales for the majority of its clothing range, focusing initially on bestsellers and new items. Delivery to Northern Ireland and other services, such as click and collect, will resume in the coming weeks. M&S expects the cyberattack to cost it about 300 million pounds in lost operating profit for the year, though it hopes to mitigate the impact through insurance and cost control.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union, has been charged with interfering with law enforcement operations after being arrested during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. According to court documents, Huerta allegedly sat in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for ICE operations and encouraged protestors to block vehicles. Huerta was arrested after allegedly pushing back against an officer attempting to move him, with the union claiming he was injured during the arrest. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while a large protest was held in Washington, D.C., in support of Huerta's release.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia increased by double-digit percentages in the first five months of the year. Analysts suggest that manufacturers are shipping more to Southeast Asian factory sites to produce finished goods for local sale or export to Western countries, including the US, to offset losses from high US tariffs. Factories often inject enough local content into goods from China to declare re-exports as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles by President Trump in response to anti-ICE protests has sparked concerns about the state of US democracy. Critics, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, have called Trump's actions an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism. Philippe Sands, a human rights lawyer, warns that these actions are part of a wider drive to create a sense of emergency and test the limits of public tolerance. The deployment bypassed the authority of the state's governor, leading to accusations of overreach. While the courts have so far remained independent, concerns remain about the potential for further erosion of checks and balances.</p>
