          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule, which offered lower rates than initially feared for some nations. Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief, with leaders praising the reduced duties of 19% as beneficial for their economies and reflective of strong U.S. ties. Taiwan will face a 20% tariff, which its president noted was a reduction from the original 32%, with hopes for further decreases through negotiation. In contrast, India, having not secured a deal, faces a 25% tariff, while Japan has finalized a 15% rate, aiming to reduce economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized increased tariffs on imports from over 60 trading partners, set to take effect in seven days. The duties, ranging from 10% to 41%, are part of a strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and were determined using a three-tiered system based on trade balance. The move also includes a significant tariff hike on Canadian goods to 35%, while Mexico received a 90-day extension. The policy has been criticized for creating economic uncertainty, though the administration touts it as a way to generate revenue and protect American workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade following stalled contract extension negotiations. McLaurin, who is in the final year of his contract, had been holding-in at training camp to avoid fines after sitting out earlier team activities. The two-time Pro Bowl selection is coming off a career-best season, where he was instrumental in the team's successful run to the NFC Championship Game. The team's general manager expressed a desire to keep McLaurin, but the lack of progress on a new deal has prompted the star player to seek opportunities elsewhere.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the widespread financial anxiety and exhaustion among millennial women, who were encouraged to pursue their passions but now face economic instability. The author contrasts her freelance creative career with the financial security of male peers in full-time roles, arguing the system relies on undervalued female labor. She observes a systemic issue where women in creative fields are expected to work for exposure, leading to a significant gender gap in long-term savings and retirement security. The piece reflects a broader sentiment of disillusionment and the struggle to achieve the stability their parents' generation enjoyed.</p>

The facility will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition, building on a partnership that began in 1995 when Kuwait became the first Gulf state to sign a military cooperation agreement with China. Both nations also pledged to continue expanding joint military training programs, signaling a steady advancement in their strategic ties in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's renewed focus on tariffs is part of a strategy to boost American manufacturing, protect domestic jobs, and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers as companies pass on the costs. The administration has implemented broad and country-specific tariffs, causing volatility in the global economy and leading organizations like the IMF to downgrade growth forecasts. While the White House argues the policy is working, critics and some businesses warn of rising inflation and disruptions to supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $200 million in federal research grants for UCLA, affecting around 300 projects funded by the National Science Foundation and other agencies. The move was justified by citing the university's alleged failure to prevent antisemitism on campus and purported discrimination in its admissions processes. This action follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" to the civil rights of Jewish students. UCLA's Chancellor called the decision to defund life-saving research deeply disappointing and stated the university is evaluating its next steps.</p>

          <p>In a significant update to its trade policy, the Trump administration has imposed a 40% tariff on all goods determined to be transshipped through other countries to evade duties. This measure was part of a broader executive order that revised tariff rates for dozens of nations, with duties ranging from 10% to 41%. The transshipment rule is seen as a direct effort to close loopholes used to avoid tariffs, a practice that undermines the administration's trade objectives. The new rates, which provide some relief to countries like Thailand and Malaysia, will take effect on August 7. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annual university tuition fees for undergraduate students in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, marking the first increase since 2017. Maintenance loans for living costs have also been increased to help students cope with rising expenses. The change comes after universities warned of significant financial pressures due to frozen fees and high inflation, with many projecting deficits. While the government says the increase aligns with inflation, students face mounting costs, as rising accommodation and living expenses often outpace the support provided by maintenance loans.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions Angels' Strategy to Buy at MLB Trade Deadline Despite Low Playoff Odds</h2>

          <p>An opinion article scrutinizes the Los Angeles Angels' decision to be buyers at the MLB trade deadline, acquiring veteran players despite having only a 1.3% chance of making the playoffs. The general manager defended the moves as a way to foster a competitive environment for the team's young core and provide them with experience in meaningful late-season games. However, the author argues the team could have traded impending free agents to address future needs and build for 2026. The piece suggests the strategy reflects a reluctance to undergo a full rebuild, potentially hindering long-term success.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has labeled his "gift to the country." The new building, which will replace the current East Wing, is designed to hold up to 650 guests, addressing the size limitations of the current East Room. Funding for the project will reportedly come from President Trump and other private "patriot donors." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since 1948 and is a significant part of the president's broader efforts to make lasting changes to the White House.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a highly successful public debut, with its stock soaring 250% on the first day of trading, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. This surge created approximately $24 billion in paper value for its primary venture capital backers, including Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. The blockbuster IPO is a significant positive event for the tech industry's public market, which has been sluggish for several years. The success comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was called off due to regulatory pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire relief fund, which is at risk of being depleted. The plan would require customers of the state's three largest utilities to contribute an additional $9 billion by extending a monthly surcharge for another 10 years. The remaining $9 billion would be paid by the shareholders of PG&E, Southern California Edison, and SDG&E. The proposal has drawn criticism from both consumer advocacy groups and utility executives, highlighting the ongoing financial challenges of mitigating and responding to increasingly destructive wildfires.

          <p>Top emergency officials in Kerr County, Texas, were either asleep or out of town when catastrophic flash floods killed at least 95 people over the July 4th holiday weekend. The county's emergency management coordinator and sheriff both testified they were asleep and had no warning of the impending disaster. The county's chief executive was also away on a family trip. The revelations came during a state hearing investigating the official response to the tragedy, amid criticism over whether adequate warnings were issued and why evacuations were not ordered sooner in the hardest-hit area.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that the majority of the 109,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first five months of the Trump administration occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida and California. Overall, ICE arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period in the previous year. The data reflects the administration's expanded mandate for ICE to carry out mass deportations, targeting a broader group of individuals living in the U.S. without legal authorization.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell suggests that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interbreeding event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancestor of the tomato. Researchers concluded that around 9 million years ago, a gene from the ancient tomato gave the potato the ability to form its characteristic starchy tubers. This hybridization event was crucial for the evolution of the potato as we know it today. By analyzing hundreds of genomes of wild and cultivated potatoes, scientists were able to solve the long-standing puzzle of the popular vegetable's genetic origins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new investigation has uncovered evidence that China is continuing to purchase Iranian oil by using a "dark fleet" of tankers to conduct ship-to-ship transfers in international waters, thereby evading U.S. sanctions. The operation, observed in the Riau archipelago off the coast of Malaysia, involves tankers switching off their transponders and obscuring their identification to hide their activities. This illicit trade is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, undermining U.S. efforts to curb the regime's nuclear program. Despite new sanctions, the activity appears to be increasing.</p>
