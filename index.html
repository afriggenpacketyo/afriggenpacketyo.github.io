          <p>The White House has agreed to keep eight migrants in Djibouti for at least two weeks to comply with a federal court order, after initially deporting them on a flight reportedly heading to South Sudan. The migrants are from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, and South Sudan. Judge Brian E. Murphy ruled that the Trump administration violated an injunction preventing deportations to countries other than their own without a chance to challenge the order. The White House claims the migrants are violent criminals and accuses Murphy of undermining U.S. diplomatic relationships and national security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to end Harvard's ability to enroll international students, citing a failure to adhere to the law and escalating a standoff with the university. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification has been revoked. Harvard responded that it is fully committed to maintaining its ability to host international students and scholars, calling the administration's action unlawful. The move comes amid demands for changes to hiring, admissions, and teaching practices to combat antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to terminate the Flores Agreement, a longstanding court settlement that mandates basic rights and services for migrant children in U.S. custody. The Justice Department argues the agreement has hindered immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings. The settlement requires federal officials to hold migrant children in safe and sanitary facilities, provide access to lawyers, and seek their expeditious release. Attorneys representing migrant children argue that eliminating the settlement would grant the government unchecked power to detain children indefinitely in secret facilities.</p>
