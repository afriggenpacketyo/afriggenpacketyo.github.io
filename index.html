          <p>Multiple immigration enforcement operations by Homeland Security, the DEA, and the FBI in Los Angeles led to dozens of arrests, sparking citywide protests. The raids occurred in various districts, with ICE reporting approximately 44 people detained and one arrest for obstruction. Community rights groups estimated even higher numbers, while law enforcement agencies asserted they were not involved in mass deportations, but were aware of the operations. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the actions, stating they sow terror in immigrant communities and disrupt safety, and Senator Alex Padilla criticized the raids as cruel and instilling fear. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing tension and fear within the affected communities.</p>

          <p>The Japan Shogi Association named Ichiyo Shimizu as its first female chief in its 101-year history, aiming to encourage greater participation from young people and women in the traditional board game. Shimizu, a professional shogi player, succeeds Yoshiharu Habu as president for a two-year term, expressing her commitment to invigorating the shogi industry while preserving its traditions. The association also approved a new promotional rule to support women in becoming pros. Shimizu turned pro in 1985 and has won 43 championships in the women's league, holding the rank of seventh dan. This marks a significant step towards inclusivity in the traditionally male-dominated world of shogi.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly suggested creating a new political party in the United States, potentially intensifying his conflict with former ally President Trump. Musk initiated a poll on X, inquiring if it's time for a new party representing the "80% in the middle," with a majority supporting the idea. He even endorsed the name "America Party," reminiscent of his America PAC, which spent heavily on Republican candidates in 2024. Musk's musings come amidst a public spat with Trump over policy and subsidies, indicating a potential challenge to Trump's influence within the political landscape. However, the feasibility of starting a new political party remains uncertain due to existing ballot access challenges and campaign finance regulations.</p>

          <p>Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a, a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He is accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country. El Salvador agreed to release Mr √Åbrego Garc√≠a after the US presented it with an arrest warrant, Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday. His lawyer has called the charges "preposterous". The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to "facilitate" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer known as the ‚ÄúDevil in the Ozarks,‚Äù was captured near the Arkansas prison he escaped from after a 13-day manhunt. Hardin, who was serving lengthy sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped by impersonating a corrections officer. The search involved bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones, and helicopters, with a border patrol team joining the effort. Hardin pleaded guilty in 2017 to first-degree murder and his DNA was matched to a 1997 sexual assault, leading to additional sentencing. His recapture brings relief to the community and ends a period of heightened alert.</p>

          <p>A juror in Harvey Weinstein's Manhattan retrial on sex crime charges voiced concerns to the judge about the behavior of other jurors during deliberations. The juror reported that another member of the jury had become the subject of a "bit of a shunning." This raises questions about the atmosphere and potential pressures within the jury room as they deliberate on the serious allegations against Weinstein. The judge will likely address the concerns to ensure a fair and impartial deliberation process. The outcome of the retrial remains uncertain amidst these reported internal dynamics.</p>

Similarly, new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to pursue a "mutually satisfactory" tariff deal during their first telephone conversation.

          <p>Tesla is encountering significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, exacerbated by a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The conflict, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, resulted in a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value and a breakdown of their previously close relationship. This fallout could impact future regulations, investigations, and government support for Tesla, including tariff exemptions. Tesla's business was already struggling with declining revenue and increased competition before the feud, and the board is facing pressure to ensure the company's stability regardless of Musk's actions.

She alleged that a network of employees helped procure drugs for these encounters, known as "hotel nights," which caused her pain and infections. Prosecutors are using Jane's testimony to support charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution against Mr. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty. Jane also testified about a financial "love contract" where Mr. Combs provided her with a monthly allowance, which he allegedly threatened to withhold if she resisted the "hotel nights."</p>

          <p>The government is finding it difficult to decrease the amount of foreign aid allocated to cover hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK. Despite efforts, the Home Office plans to spend ¬£2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the previous year's ¬£2.3bn. This money is primarily used for accommodation costs for asylum seekers, diverting funds from humanitarian and development priorities abroad. Critics argue the Home Office lacks incentive to reduce ODA spending as it doesn't impact their budget, while others highlight the negative impact on international aid commitments.</p>
