          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has vowed a strong response to new US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.  While Canada was exempted from a universal 10% tariff, the threat of a 25% tax on imported cars remains, significantly impacting Canada's automotive industry.  Carney's response has been viewed as politically advantageous, contrasting with the more cautious approach of his political opponent.  The situation underscores the ongoing tension in US-Canada trade relations and the broader impact of Trump's protectionist policies.</p>
