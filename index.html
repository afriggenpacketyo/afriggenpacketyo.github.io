        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joe Root's record-breaking innings of 166 not out propelled England to a three-wicket victory over the West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series with one game remaining. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan as England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, steering the team's recovery from an early collapse. Alzarri Joseph's fierce spell kept the West Indies in contention, but Root and Adil Rashid calmly secured the win. West Indies' total of 308 was built on Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope, though sloppy fielding from England contributed to their score; Rashid took 4-63. The final ODI is scheduled for Tuesday at The Oval, and Root's performance in this article was stellar. The English cricket team won with an impressive display of athleticism.</p>

A federal court had previously ruled that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the duties, but the administration has appealed the ruling. The White House argues that overturning the tariffs would undermine Trump's negotiating leverage with other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned to free his mother, Sally Challen, from prison after she killed his father, Richard, who had subjected her to decades of coercive control. A law passed in 2015 recognizing psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse helped secure Mrs. Challen's release after she had been jailed for life for murder in 2011. David, now a domestic abuse campaigner, has written a book about the family's experiences, emphasizing the need to protect victims. He described how the abuse had become normalized within their home and how the new law provided a language to describe the insidious nature of non-physical violence.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul expressed concerns about the cost of President Trump's "one big beautiful bill," stating that "the math doesn't really add up." Paul criticized the bill's provision to raise the debt ceiling and argued that there is too much extra money going toward padding the military budget. He indicated that he would vote for the legislation if the debt ceiling component were removed. Paul's opposition adds to the challenges facing the bill as it moves to the Senate this week.

          <p>OMB Director Russell Vought cast doubt on the necessity of seeking congressional approval for President Trump's massive cuts to the federal workforce.

He defended the cost-cutting measures proposed in the One Big Beautiful Bill act, despite concerns from experts that it could swell the US deficit. Vought also asserted that Trump is the architect of his own agenda, downplaying the influence of Project 2025. (not investment advice)</p>
