          <p>This article details the significant growth of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) over nearly 25 years, transforming from a five-state border security group into a comprehensive Eurasian body addressing security, economic, trade, and diplomatic challenges. It highlights the bloc's expansion to include 26 countries, including observer states and dialogue partners across Asia, Europe, and Africa, with nations like Myanmar and Turkey seeking full membership. The narrative traces key milestones, such as its renaming from the "Shanghai Five" in 2001 and the signing of its foundational charter in 2002. This evolution underscores the SCO's increasing geopolitical relevance and its ambition to project a new global order. The organization now serves as a platform for diverse nations to collaborate on multifaceted issues, reflecting its journey from a regional security focus to a broader international influence.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets closed with mixed results as investors reacted to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting and ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs, especially after a court ruled most of Trump's global tariffs illegal.

South Korea's Kospi increased, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 declined. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell, with Societe Generale's local unit fined for suspicious orders.

          <p>A catastrophic landslide in Sudan's remote Marra Mountains, triggered by days of heavy rain, has reportedly killed at least 1,000 people in the village of Tarasin, with only one survivor. The Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, controlling the area, has appealed for urgent international humanitarian assistance from the United Nations and other organizations. This tragedy exacerbates the already dire humanitarian crisis in Darfur, where many residents had sought refuge from the ongoing civil war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The region has been plagued by conflict since April 2023, leading to widespread displacement and famine.</p>

          <p>Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson has completed a permanent move from Manchester City to Turkish club Fenerbahce for £12.1 million, after eight successful years with City. During his tenure, the 32-year-old helped the team secure six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, and a Champions League title, making 372 appearances. His departure comes as Manchester City reportedly agreed to a £26 million deal to sign Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain. Ederson expressed pride in his achievements, including 122 clean sheets and seven assists in the Premier League, marking the end of a highly decorated period at the club.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has tragically killed over 800 people and injured 1,800, with many more feared trapped under the rubble of their homes. Rescue operations are intensely underway, employing helicopters to access remote, mountainous villages where damaged roads severely impede land travel. The Taliban government has urgently appealed for international humanitarian assistance, prompting the UN to release emergency funds and the UK to pledge £1 million in aid. This devastating event compounds Afghanistan's existing severe drought and unprecedented hunger crisis, which has been exacerbated by recent aid cuts, further highlighting the country's extreme vulnerability to natural disasters due to its geological location.</p>

The film unearths controversial aspects, such as the team's "White House" gatherings, instances of player arrests, and the enduring power struggle between coach Jimmy Johnson and owner Jerry Jones. It features remarkably candid interviews, with Jones revealing his cancer battle and players openly discussing concussions and the raw culture of that era.

Electronics, non-banking financial companies, and biotech stocks were favored, leading to significant gains for small-cap technology firms.

The club believes Lammens, who will be 26 during "Project 150," offers better long-term value than the 35-year-old Martinez.

          <p>The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, were observed across large parts of the UK on Monday night, extending from northern Scotland down to Norfolk and Kent. This rare widespread visibility was caused by a strong solar storm, specifically a coronal mass ejection detected by satellites monitoring solar activity. The increased solar energy interacted with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, producing the vibrant purple, green, and red hues. Space weather forecasters confirmed a "moderate geomagnetic storm" and suggested activity could intensify to a "G4 Severe storm" on Tuesday night, potentially making the aurora visible even to the naked eye across the entire UK.</p>

India has not officially responded to Trump's claim but has previously defended its Russian oil imports as vital for energy needs and called US tariffs "unfair."

          <p>British pubs, a cornerstone of UK culture and economy, are facing an alarming rate of closures, with one pub expected to shut down daily in 2025, leading to over 5,600 direct job losses. The industry body, British Beer and Pub Association, attributes this crisis to reduced consumer spending and escalating operational costs, including increases in minimum wage, National Insurance, and business rates. London is particularly affected, with pub managers forced to pass higher costs onto consumers, pushing the average pint price above £5. Industry leaders are urging the government for urgent action, including reforms to business rates and VAT cuts, to prevent further decline and protect the extensive supply chain.

Despite legislative incentives like low-interest construction loans, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started.

Instead of traditional detergent, it utilizes ultraviolet light to produce ozone, a powerful disinfectant that sterilizes clothes for up to five wears.
