        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese sportswear company Xtep International announced a record net profit of 913.6 million yuan for the first half of the year, a 6.4% increase. This growth was largely driven by a surge in marathon participation across China, which significantly boosted sales for its professional running shoe brands, Saucony and Merrell. While the company's main mass-market brand still accounts for the majority of revenue, the professional segment saw the most substantial sales growth, validating Xtep's strategy of taking full control of these brands' distribution in China. The company plans to continue leveraging the influence of its high-end brands to attract mass-market consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite potential public disapproval of specific policies like a federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police, crime continues to be a strong political issue for Donald Trump. Polling data and public sentiment indicate a persistent distrust of Democrats on the issue of crime, which Trump effectively leverages. This dynamic allows him to frame the narrative around law and order, appealing to voters concerned about public safety. The article suggests that this remains one of his most effective campaign themes, resonating with a significant portion of the electorate regardless of the specifics of his proposals.</p>

          <p>At least seven people were killed in a shooting at a pool hall in Santo Domingo, Ecuador, marking the latest in a series of violent massacres as the country grapples with escalating gang-related violence. The attack, captured on purported security footage, showed masked gunmen opening fire on patrons before fleeing. This incident follows similar mass killings at a pool hall and a cockfighting ring in recent months. Ecuador, once relatively peaceful, is now experiencing a crisis driven by transnational drug cartels using its ports for shipping, leading to a dramatic increase in its homicide rate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before a significant White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders, Donald Trump asserted on social media that the war with Russia could end "almost immediately" if Zelenskyy chose to. Trump also reiterated his stance that Ukraine would not join NATO and would not regain control of Crimea, which Russia occupied in 2014. The comments apply pressure on Kyiv to accept territorial concessions for a peace deal, a position that European leaders have approached with caution. The summit is seen as a critical moment for European security, with leaders aiming to support Ukraine while defending their own interests.</p>

Semenyo later posted on social media, expressing gratitude for the supportive response from teammates, Liverpool players, fans, and officials, highlighting how the "entire football family stood together" in response to the abuse.</p>

"Skibidi" is a versatile, often nonsensical term from a YouTube series, while "tradwife" refers to a "traditional wife." The update also includes terms reflecting modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device used to feign activity while working remotely. Lexical program manager Colin McIntosh noted that internet culture is significantly influencing the English language, and the dictionary only adds words that demonstrate potential staying power.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Trump's Proposed 'Golden Dome' Missile Defense is a Costly Mistake</h2>

          <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system is an expensive and strategically flawed concept. Drawing parallels to France's failed Maginot Line, the article suggests the system, estimated to cost at least $175 billion, misapplies the lessons from Israel's smaller-scale Iron Dome to the vast strategic challenges facing the U.S. The author contends that adversaries like Russia and China are developing advanced missiles and drone swarms that could easily bypass such a defense. The piece concludes that the exorbitant cost is unconscionable and that the funds would be better allocated to more effective and affordable defense priorities.</p>

          <p>An American-Israeli epigraphist, Michael S. Bar-Ron, is reanalyzing 3,800-year-old Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions found in Egypt's Sinai desert that may contain the oldest known written references to Moses. The etchings, discovered at an ancient turquoise mining site, potentially read "This is from Moses" and "Declaration of Moses," predating the earliest parts of the Bible by centuries. The inscriptions also appear to express resistance by Semitic laborers against the worship of the pagan goddess Ba`alat, who had a temple at the site. If verified through peer review, this discovery would provide significant new context for historical and biblical studies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring a public offering for mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the plan is fraught with complexity and uncertainty. The proposal, which could be the largest IPO in history, faces several major obstacles that analysts believe must be resolved to attract investors. Key issues include addressing the U.S. Treasury's massive senior preferred stock holdings and closing a $181 billion capital shortfall, both of which could lead to litigation or unattractive returns. There are also concerns that catering too much to investors could disrupt the housing market and lead to higher mortgage rates for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese population, which provided enthusiastic support despite a 4-0 loss to the US Virgin Islands. For the community, many of whom have complex immigration histories linked to U.S. nuclear testing, the event was a powerful moment of representation and pride.

Brody Loch discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick and reported it to authorities, who recovered the vehicle and found human remains inside. The car's VIN matched that of a vehicle belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing in September 1967. While the remains await formal identification, authorities believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family.

While maintaining his connection to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), he has also sought endorsements and appearances with prominent progressives like Elizabeth Warren and has softened his past "defund the police" rhetoric. The article explores the internal divisions within the DSA and questions what kind of socialism Mamdani represents. As he faces a general election, Mamdani must draw on the DSA's organizational strength while managing the ideological excesses and fractiousness that characterize parts of the movement.</p>

In contrast, the U.S. is depicted as being bogged down by legalism and procedure, which stifles construction and industrial progress. The article warns that if America refuses to rebuild its engineering culture, it risks becoming subject to the whims of countries that do.</p>

The piece contends that while Ganz rightly notes that politics is an art, abandoning empirical tools like polling in favor of purely humanistic study is susceptible to bias and wishful thinking.

The posts, which range from retro-style recruitment posters to AI-generated images and viral video formats, are highly polarizing, delighting supporters while drawing criticism for their tone and content. Experts suggest the strategy is designed to "own the libs" and promote a nationalist, white-centered vision of America by framing immigration as an invasion to be repelled. The administration has defended the posts, with one spokesperson stating, "The White House consistently posts banger memes."</p>

          <p>Germany's federal government paid out €20.2 billion in social welfare benefits in 2024, a nearly 15% increase from the previous year, according to new data from the Federal Statistical Office. The rise in spending, which covers benefits for those unable to earn a living, comes as the government faces a significant budget shortfall. More than half of the expenditures went towards basic income support for the elderly and those with reduced earning capacity. In response to the budget gap, Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has indicated that he cannot rule out tax increases to generate necessary revenue.</p>

This approval makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class drug authorized for MASH, a condition affecting about 5% of U.S. adults. The decision was based on a trial showing Wegovy significantly improved liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. Following the announcement, shares of Novo Nordisk climbed nearly 5%, as the new application expands the drug's market beyond weight loss and diabetes treatment.</p>

          <p>Following a call from President Trump, Republicans in Texas are attempting to redraw congressional maps to create five more GOP-leaning districts, a move that prompted state Democrats to temporarily leave the state to block the vote. In response, California's Democratic governor is pushing a plan to create five new Democratic-leaning districts to counteract the Texas effort. This article explains the process of redistricting and the practice of gerrymandering, where district lines are manipulated for partisan advantage through "packing" and "cracking" voters.

The struggles are attributed to rising interest rates and deteriorating market conditions impacting deals made in 2021 and 2022.

While Israeli officials have remained quiet, some analysts believe they fear emboldening further economic pressure. Though the direct financial impact of this single action may be limited, it signals growing international scrutiny. Despite this and targeted sanctions from other nations, Israel's economy has shown resilience, with foreign investment rebounding in 2024, highlighting the complexities of using economic tools to influence its policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and federal agents for "roving patrols" in Washington D.C. is entering its second week, prompting criticism that he is creating a "police state." The administration justifies the move by citing a supposed crime crisis, a claim that critics and crime data refute, as violence in the city reached a 30-year low last year. The crackdown, which included a failed attempt to take over the city's police department, lacks a clear endgame or a plan for the vulnerable residents being displaced.

          <p>Many economists are expressing skepticism about the Trump administration's assertion that its widespread tariffs will lead to a U.S. manufacturing renaissance. Experts argue that the president's erratic policies, lack of focus on strategic industries, and the increased costs of production for American companies will likely hinder, rather than help, manufacturing employment. Unlike the Biden administration's targeted industrial policies for sectors like semiconductors, Trump's blanket tariffs create uncertainty and fail to foster the long-term investment needed for new factories. Critics also note that retaliatory tariffs and higher input costs could ultimately lead to a net reduction in factory jobs. (not investment advice)</p>
