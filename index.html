          <p>The suspect in the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, along with the attempted murder of another politician, allegedly planned the attacks for months. Vance Boelter, disguised as a law enforcement officer, carried out the deadly rampage in the Minneapolis suburbs. The timeline details how Boelter targeted state Sen. John Hoffman, state Rep. Melissa Hortman, and state Sen. Ann Rest, with Hortman and her husband fatally shot. The suspect was eventually apprehended near his farm after a neighbor spotted him on a trail camera and called 911, marking the end of a shocking series of events that sent shockwaves across Minnesota and the nation. Optimism in the wake of this tragedy is low.</p>

          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom at the G7 summit, standing alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The agreement, signed with the U.K., was briefly dropped by Trump, who jokingly blamed the wind, and the White House later clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom. When questioned about differences between this agreement and one signed in May, Trump said there weren't many, and he praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister. The agreement includes details on steel and aluminum, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick determining quotas for tariff-free entry. Despite the minor mishap, the event highlighted ongoing trade relations between the U.S. and the U.K.</p>

          <p>Dr. Fiona Havers, the scientist overseeing the CDC team collecting COVID and RSV hospitalization data, resigned due to concerns about data objectivity. She cited a lack of confidence that the data would be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor for vaccine policy decisions. Her resignation occurred before a meeting of a new vaccine panel established by Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., who previously dismissed the CDC's independent vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy's moves have raised concerns about the integrity of vaccine policy decisions, as he has appointed members with histories of objecting to vaccines. The HHS spokesperson stated that the agency is committed to ‚Äúgold standard science‚Äù and objective data.</p>

          <p>President Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, citing developments in the Middle East. He is returning to Washington to address "many important matters," seemingly related to the Israel-Iran conflict. Prior to his departure, Trump stated he had spoken to everyone regarding Israel and Iran, suggesting a potential deal might be reached. He also indicated that Iran was interested in de-escalation talks. The president's return comes as Israel and Iran trade airstrikes, with the U.S. maintaining it is not directly involved but has warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region.</p>

The repeated losses have united Canadians, with many rallying behind the Oilers as "Canada's team," especially amid heightened tensions between Canada and the US.

          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, has reported to federal prison in Pennsylvania. Mizuhara was sentenced to 57 months in prison for stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts. He pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting to placing approximately 19,000 bets and accumulating over $40 million in debt. Ohtani publicly addressed the scandal, stating he never placed sports bets and that Mizuhara's story was fabricated.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health was "void and illegal." The judge stated that the cuts, targeting research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), represented unlawful discrimination. The judge ordered that previously awarded grants be reinstated to the organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The move came amid efforts to cut 10,000 jobs from federal health agencies. The ruling only applies to some of the grants mentioned in the lawsuit, with further claims to be decided after additional evidence is presented.</p>
