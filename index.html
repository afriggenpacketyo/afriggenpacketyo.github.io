          <p>Former prominent bond trader Howard Rubin, 70, has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges he operated a network, spending over $1 million, and used a Manhattan penthouse as a "sex dungeon" where he allegedly brutalized women beyond their consent, sometimes causing injuries requiring medical attention. Prosecutors are seeking to deny bail, citing his significant wealth and overseas assets, including a $74 million Cayman Islands account. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking six women and ordered to pay $3.85 million.</p>

Posner, who escaped a Nazi ghetto as a child and later had a career in dance and drama, was a vocal advocate for educating young people about the Holocaust.

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people and himself in a Midtown Manhattan shooting in July, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the degenerative brain disease and asked for his brain to be studied, blaming the NFL for concealing its dangers. While experts note that a CTE diagnosis does not fully explain such violent behavior, the disease is linked to repeated head trauma and can cause symptoms like aggression and impulsivity. The finding adds another layer to the ongoing discussion about head injuries in contact sports.</p>

She explained that her relationships, including her first marriage to the late musician Eddie Van Halen, began without the formality of a typical date. Bertinelli recounted meeting Van Halen backstage at a concert, after which they were "together ever since" and married eight months later.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve having recently cut interest rates, savers are facing diminishing returns, but opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October still presents advantages. Locking in a fixed rate now allows interest to begin compounding immediately, maximizing returns before rates potentially fall further. Experts predict a high probability of another Fed rate cut at the end of October, which could prompt banks to lower their CD rates in anticipation. Acting proactively in the first half of the month could help savers secure a more attractive rate before they decline. (not investment advice)</p>

Key points of conflict include a dinner where Trump allegedly demanded loyalty, Comey's public confirmation of the Russia investigation, and Trump's subsequent firing of Comey in 2017.

This move signals a potential softening of the party's stance on the controversial welfare policy, which is facing increasing pressure for repeal from within Labour ranks.

          <p>With credit card delinquencies rising, understanding the timeline for late payments is crucial for consumers to mitigate financial damage. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major consequence occurs after 30 days, when the late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging one's credit score. At 60 days, issuers may impose a high penalty APR, and after 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts can begin, potentially leading to account closure and severe credit damage.

          <p>This opinion article contends that accusing critics of hypocrisy is a common but ineffective tactic used to defend attacks on free speech from both the political left and right. The author argues that this approach serves as a dodge, shifting focus from the principles of liberal norms to judging the people involved. It points out that while "cancel culture" has been attributed to the left, its targets were often liberals, and that illiberalism exists across the political spectrum. The piece concludes that focusing on others' perceived hypocrisy is a way to avoid making a principled case for one's own actions, ultimately weakening the defense of free expression.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term or $1,452 for a 15-year term. This represents a modest saving of about $16 per month compared to rates from earlier in the year.

          <p>Costco reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter, though the results were not entirely perfect, causing a slight dip in its stock price. The retailer's same-store sales growth of 5.7% missed analyst expectations, and membership renewal rates saw a small decline. Despite these minor blemishes, analysts highlighted many positive aspects, including strong membership fee growth and consistent core profitability. While some firms lowered their price targets, most maintained a positive outlook, viewing Costco as a resilient company with a strong value proposition that continues to gain market share.

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a significant collection of over 28,000 fossils to Indonesia, including parts of the historic "Java Man." These fossils, discovered in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois on the island of Java when it was a Dutch colony, are among the first known remains of Homo erectus. The decision follows a recommendation from a government committee, which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population and are of spiritual and economic importance to Indonesia. This repatriation is part of the Netherlands' broader effort to reckon with its colonial past.</p>

The fan, Glenn Mutti-Driscoll, said the boy deserved the memento more than he did. The ball, potentially worth a six-figure sum, was then given back to the team by the young recipient, Marcus Ruelos, in exchange for a signed bat, because he felt it meant more to the player. The heartwarming story went viral, standing in stark contrast to other recent incidents of poor fan etiquette and highlighting a moment of pure generosity in sports.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, has been indicted on charges of making a false statement and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020, where he was questioned about his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. Prosecutors allege that Comey misled the committee regarding the authorization of leaks to the media. The indictment comes just days after Donald Trump publicly called for his prosecution, raising concerns among critics about the political weaponization of the Justice Department. Comey maintains his innocence.</p>

Separately, the Cutter Diligence seized another 8,700 pounds from a vessel north of Panama. The agency released images from the operations, including one showing an alleged drug boat on fire, explaining that such vessels are often sunk after narcotics are removed to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards.</p>

          <p>This article explores the intense and "tribal" atmosphere of the Ryder Cup, arguing that its location at New York's Bethpage Black course will amplify the event's already combustible nature. The author describes the tournament as a rare moment in golf when boisterous crowds become a key opponent, especially for the visiting European team. Drawing on past examples of crowd behavior at U.S. Ryder Cups, the piece anticipates that the New York audience will be particularly vocal and provocative. It suggests this loud, partisan environment is a defining characteristic of the event, transforming the typically quiet sport into a veritable bloodsport for three days.</p>

While the government touts benefits like easier identity verification for citizens, the plan has faced opposition over concerns about mass surveillance, data security, and its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "rule of thirds" is a retirement income strategy designed to provide both security and flexibility for retirees concerned about outliving their savings. The rule suggests converting one-third of one's retirement portfolio into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the savings can then be invested for growth or kept liquid for unexpected costs, balancing a steady, pension-like income stream with the potential for market gains. This approach aims to reduce stress during market volatility and may allow for higher overall withdrawal rates. (not investment advice)</p>

It breaks with decades of precedent where an open press was seen as essential for holding the military accountable to the American public. The author contends that limiting access will not stop reporters from doing their jobs, but it will reduce the public's access to vital information and makes the world's most powerful military look weak.</p>
