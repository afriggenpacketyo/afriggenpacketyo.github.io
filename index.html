          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's announcement to block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accused the administration of a ‚Äúcampaign of retribution‚Äù for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. Harvard argued that the decision would destabilize the university's existence, as international students contribute significantly to its mission. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university. The White House responded by accusing Harvard of failing to address antisemitism on campus. </p>

          <p>Eight defendants were found guilty of crimes linked to the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian in her Paris hotel room, nearly a decade after the incident. The sentences ranged from three to eight years in prison, but most were suspended due to the defendants' ages and clean records since the incident. Kim Kardashian, who testified during the trial, expressed satisfaction with the verdict and stated she could now move on. The robbery involved masked men stealing millions of dollars' worth of jewelry, including a diamond engagement ring. </p>

          <p>Boeing reached a $1.1 billion deal with the Department of Justice to avoid prosecution for the two 737 Max jetliner crashes that killed 346 people. The agreement requires Boeing to invest in improving its compliance, safety, and quality program, with $445 million set aside for compensation to the victims' families. Relatives of the victims expressed anger at the non-prosecution deal, while the Justice Department defended it as a fair and just resolution. The deal allows Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before the crashes. </p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted lower court orders requiring the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to hand over information to a government watchdog group. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) seeking information about DOGE's operations and personnel. The Justice Department argues that DOGE is a presidential advisory body, not an agency subject to FOIA. The temporary stay allows the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief. </p>

          <p>The security detail for Trump administration border czar Tom Homan costs approximately $1 million per month, raising concerns about government spending. The cost includes salaries for agents, airfare, hotel bills, and other travel expenses. DHS defended the security measures, citing dangerous rhetoric surrounding the administration's immigration enforcement efforts. The high cost has drawn criticism from those seeking to shrink government spending, with some describing it as "extravagant." </p>

          <p>Lebanon's government will begin disarming armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps in June, aiming to bring all weapons under state control. This move is seen as a trial run before addressing the larger challenge of disarming Hezbollah. The agreement was reached with the Palestinian Authority, emphasizing that the era of weapons outside state authority is over. The disarming process is supported by international players, including Turkey and Qatar, who are mediating with Palestinian groups. </p>
