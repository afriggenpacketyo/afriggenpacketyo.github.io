        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has terminated trade talks with Canada, a move experts believe could raise prices for consumers on goods like cars and home appliances. The decision was a response to a Canadian ad featuring Ronald Reagan that was critical of tariffs. This halt could keep existing 35% tariffs on many goods, plus specific levies on steel and aluminum, in place for longer, affecting products that rely heavily on these materials. The breakdown in talks also casts a shadow over the upcoming review of the USMCA trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Early tallies in the Irish presidential election indicate significant support for independent candidate Catherine Connolly over her main rival, Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. The election, which will decide the successor to President Michael D. Higgins, saw a third candidate's name remain on the ballot despite his withdrawal, leading to a high number of spoiled votes. Despite the strong showing for Connolly, who is backed by several left-wing parties, overall voter turnout is projected to be near a record low.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has resulted in at least four deaths across Haiti and the Dominican Republic due to landslides and falling trees. The storm has destroyed hundreds of homes and disrupted water supplies, with forecasters from the US National Hurricane Center warning it is likely to intensify into a hurricane. The system is expected to bring catastrophic rainfall, leading to severe flooding and landslides in Jamaica, Hispaniola, and parts of Cuba. This event is part of what is predicted to be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham is preparing for the high-profile El Clasico match against Barcelona, which presents a crucial opportunity for him to showcase his form. After being left out of the recent England squad by manager Thomas Tuchel, the midfielder is looking to make a statement in a game that will also feature fellow Englishman Marcus Rashford for Barcelona. Bellingham, who is returning from a shoulder injury, recently scored a match-winning goal in the Champions League, signaling a potential return to the high standards he set in his debut season.</p>

          <p>Social media posts claiming that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a fact-check. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like renovations or low revenue, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 iconic markets are scheduled to open as planned. The viral claims appear to originate from a single, questionable source that uses sensationalist language and AI-generated images.

A new "Wintering Well" initiative is providing therapeutic lamps and activity guides through libraries to help people establish new routines.

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein scandal continues to shadow President Donald Trump, particularly with the release of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir and public calls for the full release of government files on the case. While Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s, political analysts suggest that any potential revelations may not damage his standing with his core supporters. Many of his voters perceive the entire political establishment as corrupt, and thus may apply "different rules" to Trump, viewing any accusations as part of a broader political attack rather than a specific moral failing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Ontario's government of "dirty play" for its decision to continue airing a controversial trade advertisement during the first two World Series games before pausing it. Trump had previously halted all trade negotiations with Canada, citing the ad, which features Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the ad would be paused on Monday to allow talks to resume, but explicitly stated it would run over the weekend. The ad has been criticized by the Reagan Foundation for being misleadingly edited.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur will focus on pressing regional security issues, including the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord aimed at resolving the Thai-Cambodian dispute. However, diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar have been largely ineffective, with the bloc divided on how to handle the country's military junta and its plan for elections amid the conflict. The summit will also mark a milestone with the admission of Timor-Leste as ASEAN's 11th member.</p>

          <p>As a potential meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump approaches, Beijing's ambassador to Washington has called for cooperation and "shared prosperity." Speaking amid renewed trade tensions, the envoy emphasized that there are a thousand reasons to maintain a positive China-U.S. relationship. The comments come as high-level delegations from both nations are meeting in Malaysia for critical economic talks. The potential summit, expected to occur on the sidelines of the APEC meeting in South Korea, is seen as a key opportunity to de-escalate the ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>The complete demolition of the White House East Wing to make way for a new $300 million ballroom commissioned by President Trump has generated significant criticism. The East Wing, first built in 1902 and expanded by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942, served as the offices for the first lady and the public entrance for tours and events. Presidential historians and preservation groups have expressed dismay at the destruction of the historic structure. The Trump administration has defended the move, calling the wing a "cheaply built add-on" and dismissing the backlash as "manufactured outrage."</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly demanded the prosecution of several current and former Justice Department and FBI officials, including special counsel Jack Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland. Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI investigation, codenamed Arctic Frost, that reportedly obtained the phone records of nine Republican lawmakers following the 2020 election. This marks the latest instance of the president urging the justice system to target his political adversaries. The FBI probe examined communications surrounding the efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>

          <p>Russia is facing a severe demographic decline, with a shrinking and aging population that President Vladimir Putin has called a crucial issue for the nation. In response, the government has enacted laws promoting "traditional family values," including bans on promoting abortion and "child-free ideology," and outlawing LGBTQ+ activism. However, these measures are failing to reverse the trend, which is exacerbated by economic uncertainty, the war in Ukraine, and an exodus of young men. Birth rates have fallen to near-record lows, while the population continues to age.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has imposed sanctions on several subsidiaries of the South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha, including its U.S.-based Philly Shipyard. The ministry accused Hanwha of assisting a U.S. investigation into Chinese competitors that led to new port fees. The sanctioned entities are now barred from any business activities with Chinese individuals or companies. The move comes as Hanwha's acquisition of the Philly Shipyard is being promoted by Seoul as a key part of a U.S.-South Korea initiative to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry.</p>

The list includes major tech companies like Google and Amazon, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, and cryptocurrency firms such as Coinbase and Ripple. This has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as these entities may be seeking favorable policy outcomes, regulatory approval, or government contracts. The White House has dismissed these concerns, stating the project is being privately funded to improve the "People's House."</p>
