          <p>Super Micro has issued disappointing guidance, citing 'economic uncertainty and tariff impacts,' following preliminary results for the latest quarter that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of 40 to 50 cents on revenue of $5.6 billion to $6.4 billion for the next quarter, below analyst estimates. CEO Charles Liang attributed the underperformance to customers delaying commitments while evaluating AI platforms. Super Micro's revenue grew 19% year over year, but net income declined. Liang stated that the company is not providing fiscal 2026 guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty.</p>

This strategy has slowed some cases, including that of Rumeysa Ozturk, who has been detained for six weeks. Lawyers for the students argue that the deportations violate the First Amendment.

          <p>A US think tank suggests a pragmatic approach towards North Korea, advocating for a ‚Äúslow and paced‚Äù strategy on denuclearization and involving regional stakeholders like China. This proposal aligns with reports that the Trump administration is consulting experts to revive talks with Pyongyang. During his first term, Trump held historic talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but disagreements over sanctions relief and nuclear disarmament scope led to stalled negotiations. The think tank's recommendation emphasizes a measured approach to address the complex issue of North Korea's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures has sparked widespread criticism and legal scrutiny, with concerns raised about potential conflicts of interest and violations of the Constitution's emoluments clauses. Experts argue that Trump's promotion of his meme coins and his family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, could constitute bribery and corruption. The president's actions have drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, and have put the passage of cybercurrency legislation pending before the Senate in jeopardy.

          <p>India said on Wednesday it had carried out strikes on Pakistan, intensifying a conflict between two nuclear powers. The attacks come after 26 people, most of them tourists, were killed on April 22 in a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. India‚Äôs government said there were ‚Äúcross-border linkages‚Äù to Pakistan, which denied involvement. The roots of the Kashmir conflict trace back to the 1947 partition of British India, which led to the creation of a predominantly Hindu India and a predominantly Muslim Pakistan. India and Pakistan have fought three wars over Kashmir, and there have been numerous military incursions, police crackdowns and terrorist attacks as militants have killed scores of civilians, including Hindu pilgrims.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to eliminate Energy Star, the energy efficiency certification program for home appliances, as part of an agency reorganization. EPA managers announced the decision during a staff meeting, stating that divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated. The Energy Star program has been credited with saving households and businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that eliminating the program is counterintuitive to reducing household costs and addressing the energy crisis. The Trump administration previously attempted to defund Energy Star.</p>

          <p>Oil prices have fallen significantly since the start of January, leading to lower prices at the pump for consumers. However, this drop is not due to increased U.S. production but rather to economic uncertainty caused by tariffs and increased production from OPEC+. The combination of these factors has brought prices low enough to hamper U.S. production, potentially leading to cuts in spending and hiring by oil producers. The article discusses the conflicting goals of the Trump administration's energy policy, which aims for both low prices for consumers and a boom for oil companies.</p>
