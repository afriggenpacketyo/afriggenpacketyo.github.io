            <p>Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a meeting notable because of their past disagreements over immigration policy. Francis has consistently advocated for the humane treatment of migrants, a position that has often put him at odds with conservative members of the U.S. Catholic Church. Vance had previously defended the Trump administration's immigration policies using a concept from medieval Catholic theology, which Francis appeared to correct in a letter. The meeting included discussions on international conflicts, migrants, and prisoners, with the Vatican expressing hope for collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the U.S.</p>

            <p>According to an analysis, Trump's trade war with China could ultimately strengthen China's geopolitical position and weaken the U.S. economy. China's dominance in producing key goods gives it an advantage, while the U.S. struggles to replace Chinese imports. China has been preparing for economic conflict, investing in industries to reduce dependence on the U.S. and developing offensive economic weapons. The U.S. could win by joining forces with allies, but Trump's approach has been counterproductive, threatening allies and hindering the formation of a united front. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to the lowest point of his presidency, according to a CNBC survey, amidst discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become more negative about his handling of the economy. The survey reveals concerns about tariffs, inflation, and the possibility of a recession, with many believing the economy will worsen over the next year. Despite these economic concerns, the survey indicates little change in congressional preference between Democrats and Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As the world grapples with the economic implications of Trump's tariff policies, humor has emerged as a coping mechanism and a form of protest. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., has been creating memes and sarcastic captions to critique the U.S. and its president. Other examples include a Canadian premier mocking Trump and a children's book author using a fish to comment on the tariffs. The article suggests that humor has become a way to make sense of overwhelming events and express dissent in the face of economic uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Hotplate is a new software platform that helps professional chefs and home cooks organize food sales for pickup. The service automates scheduling, order flow, and pickup in exchange for a percentage of the seller's sales. Hotplate revolves around food "events," which are scheduled food drops. Unlike some gig companies that pay you to do their bidding, Hotplate is setting you up to be your own boss. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Lancaster Mayor Rex Parris has sparked outrage with controversial remarks about homelessness, including suggesting providing free fentanyl and calling for a "purge" of homeless people. These comments, made during a city council meeting and later amplified in an interview, have drawn criticism from political opponents and advocacy groups. Parris defended his statements, claiming they were directed at the criminal element within the homeless population. The remarks have led to calls for his recall and sparked a broader debate about the city's approach to addressing homelessness.</p>

            <p>The Czech Republic's successful opposition to billionaire leader Andrej Babiš, dubbed "the Czech Trump," offers a potential blueprint for anti-Trump protesters in the US. The Million Moments for Democracy movement organized mass rallies that eventually translated into electoral defeat for Babiš's party. The Czech example highlights the importance of converting discontent into votes, maintaining a unified message, and encouraging broad participation. Despite the challenges of the US's two-party system, the Czech model suggests that sustained protests can influence public opinion and compel political action.</p>

            <p>Hungary under Viktor Orban offers a cautionary tale on dismantling democracy, with the leader consolidating power by targeting the media, civil society, and universities. Investigative journalist Andras Petho describes how Orban's government gained control of the media by approving deals for loyal associates and purging unfriendly voices. Despite these challenges, independent newspapers like Magyar Hang persist, funded by subscriptions and printed outside the country. Political scientist Peter Kreko highlights Orban's step-by-step strategy to weaken checks on power, warning of similarities to Trump's actions.</p>
