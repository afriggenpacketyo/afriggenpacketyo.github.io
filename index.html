          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly higher as investors processed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, though sentiment remained cautious due to ongoing tariff disputes. This uncertainty persists even after a U.S. federal court ruled that many of President Trump's global tariffs are illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined. Investors are also watching key economic indicators, including South Korea's slowing inflation and Australia's current account balance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joe Bugner, a Hungarian-born British heavyweight boxer renowned for twice going the distance with Muhammad Ali, has passed away at the age of 75. His career spanned 32 years, during which he held the British, Commonwealth, and European heavyweight titles and fought other legends like Joe Frazier. Despite his talent, he had a complicated relationship with the British public after defeating beloved boxer Henry Cooper in 1971. Bugner, who was diagnosed with dementia, spent his final years in an assisted living home in Australia after retiring in 1999.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has presented new evidence that could solve the nearly 50-year mystery of Imam Musa al-Sadr, a revered Lebanese cleric who vanished in Libya in 1978. Using advanced facial recognition technology, researchers determined a "high probability" that a corpse photographed in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011 is Sadr. The cleric's disappearance has been a source of intense speculation, and some believe his moderate political influence could have altered the course of the Iranian Revolution. The findings suggest Sadr was likely killed, contradicting claims he is still alive.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Draw Parallels Between Modern Britain and the Late Soviet Union</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some prominent intellectuals in the Anglo-American world are drawing parallels between the current state of their nations and the final years of the Soviet Union. The article highlights an opinion piece in The Telegraph that specifically compares Britain in the 2020s to the USSR in the 1980s. This comparison points to a managerial class that ignores looming change and a political rigidity that stifles debate on obsolete dogmas. The analysis suggests that while the comparison may be stark, the potential decline of the West warrants serious consideration for its global consequences.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who was born with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, is raising awareness about the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. From door handles she cannot operate to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets, Tidball argues the building is failing to accommodate disabled individuals. While some minor changes have been made, she asserts that the institution that passed the Equalities Act 15 years ago is not living up to its own standards, making politics less inclusive for the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities.</p>

Using advanced uranium-series dating, researchers determined the skull is at least 286,000 years old, placing it in the Middle Pleistocene era. This new, reliable age strengthens the theory that the fossil belongs to Homo heidelbergensis, a species believed to be the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans.

          <p>The recent transfers of Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa, who both reportedly refused to train to force moves from their clubs, have ignited a debate about player power in football. Their successful tactics contrast sharply with the situation of defender Marc Guehi, whose professionalism was praised but whose desired move to Liverpool ultimately collapsed. The article explores the differing perspectives on this issue, with some critics calling the players' actions "despicable," while others argue clubs can be hypocritical, as they often show little loyalty when deciding to sell players or fire managers.</p>

          <p>Thousands of union members participated in Labor Day events across the United States, with many speakers using the occasion to decry the policies of the Trump administration. At a large rally in Wilmington, California, organizers and politicians argued that the administration's actions weaken unions, harm workers, and embolden corporations. Speakers directly linked the fight for workers' rights to the fight for immigrant rights, criticizing recent immigration raids. In contrast, the White House issued a proclamation stating that the president's policies are putting American workers first and restoring the dignity of labor.</p>

          <p>Costco is now fully implementing a new rule that grants its Executive Members an exclusive hour of shopping on weekday mornings before the warehouses open to other customers. The policy, which provides access from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on most days, was introduced in June but is only now being strictly enforced after a grace period. This change is part of the company's effort to reward its most loyal members, who pay a higher annual fee.

          <p>Liverpool has completed the signing of Swedish striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record transfer fee of £125 million. The 25-year-old signed a six-year contract after a protracted saga that concluded on the final day of the transfer window. The deal is the centerpiece of a record-breaking summer for Liverpool, which has now spent over £415 million on new players. The move makes Isak one of the most expensive players in football history, behind only Neymar and Kylian Mbappé's transfers to Paris St-Germain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite repeated threats to punish Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump has held back on implementing a new wave of significant sanctions. According to analysts, this hesitation is strategic and multifaceted. One key factor is Trump's desire to position himself as a peace-broker, potentially for a Nobel Peace Prize, which would be undermined by escalating economic conflict. Additionally, there are concerns within Washington that further isolating Russia could push it into a deeper, more formal alliance with China, strengthening Beijing's global position and access to resources.</p>

Washington has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel but has not signaled any intent to invade.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will overturn a recent appeals court ruling that deemed President Trump's broad use of tariffs illegal. Bessent stated the administration is preparing a legal brief arguing that the tariffs are a necessary response to national emergencies like trade imbalances and the influx of fentanyl. If the court does not uphold the president's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Bessent indicated the administration has a backup plan, potentially using Section 338 of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.
