Jones, who worked for Sheen, visited Blenheim Palace before the theft, even using the toilet and taking photos, with the judge noting both men had extensive criminal records.</p>

          <p>Seven men have been convicted of sexual assault and exploitation of two teenage girls in Rochdale over a five-year period. The girls, groomed from age 13, were treated as "sex slaves" and subjected to repeated sexual abuse. The men, who worked as stallholders and taxi drivers, plied the girls with drugs, alcohol, and shelter in exchange for sex. The victims reported their abuse to authorities, but their concerns were allegedly ignored at the time. The convictions are part of Operation Lytton, an ongoing investigation into historical child sexual exploitation in the town.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, oil prices have surged while stock markets have declined amid escalating fears of a broader Middle East conflict. Crude oil prices experienced their most significant increase since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, pushing the U.S. benchmark near $73 per barrel. This surge could potentially reverse the recent decline in gasoline prices, impacting inflation. Investors reacted nervously to the air strikes, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to drop by approximately 500 points in early trading. (not investment advice)</p>
