Most Asian markets are closed for holidays, while U.S. futures show a slight downturn after a robust week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 achieved its longest winning streak since 2004, recovering losses incurred since April 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 80th anniversary of the end of the Nazi era and the liberation of concentration camps comes at a pivotal time for Germany, as the last of the survivors, liberators, and perpetrators are dying, and the far right is gaining ground. At a memorial ceremony in Dachau, survivors spoke of the horrors they endured and expressed concern about the rise of nationalism. The anniversary also comes after a change in the tone of the relationship between Germany and the United States, with the Trump administration expressing support for the far-right AfD party.</p>

          <p>A ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck near the main terminal of Israelâ€™s international airport close to Tel Aviv, resulting in a temporary suspension of flights. The strike, carried out by the Houthi militia, prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to threaten retaliation against Iran. The Houthi military spokesman claimed responsibility for targeting the airport and warned international airlines to stay away. The incident marks a significant success for the Houthis and a failure for Israel's missile defense system.</p>
