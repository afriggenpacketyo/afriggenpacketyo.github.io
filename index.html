          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has vehemently denied rumors of his resignation, calling them "absurd," yet he could not confirm his tenure past the summer transfer window. His relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis has reportedly soured, largely due to disagreements over transfer market activity, despite the club signing eight senior players and bringing over £100m of talent off the bench in a recent match. Nuno insists harmony can be restored and his relationship with Marinakis repaired, but football experts believe his public questioning of the owner puts his job at significant risk. Fans, while supportive of Nuno, also acknowledge the owner's significant financial commitment to the club, highlighting the complex situation that may see him depart despite his wishes.</p>

          <p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen expressed deep concern over a series of unexplained firings of top U.S. military leaders by Secretary Hegseth, including the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, stating Congress has not been informed. She highlighted the troubling trend of replacing professional military leaders with political appointees, which could compromise honest assessments of military situations. From Amman, Jordan, Shaheen also condemned Israel's blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, calling the man-made famine a "shameful black mark on humanity" and a war crime. She directly criticized Prime Minister Netanyahu for obstructing aid, urging him to change his position, and agreed that the U.S. should have acted more forcefully sooner to prevent the catastrophic civilian harm in Gaza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned that the UK economy faces an "acute challenge" from weak underlying growth and a post-pandemic decline in its workforce. He attributed this to a rise in long-term sickness and a significant drop in young people in employment, suggesting these factors are intertwined with an aging population, which will see 40% of the UK population over 64 by 2040. Bailey emphasized the urgent need to boost economic productivity, noting the UK lags behind other advanced economies in labor force participation, with mental health being the most common reason for inactivity. These issues contribute to fears that Britain's high inflation rate, currently the highest in the G7, may be slow to return to its 2% target, despite recent GDP growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Forecasters warn of "dangerously hot" conditions and significant risks of heat-related illnesses, especially for those without adequate cooling. The combination of high heat, low humidity, and dry lightning has also elevated critical wildfire conditions across Southern California, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to deploy additional firefighting resources.</p>

Northumbria Police confirmed the incident, and his family released a heartbreaking statement expressing the "impossible to put into words" pain of their sudden loss, saying their lives will never be the same. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed, and the funfair, which described the event as a "tragic accident" and considers its team like family, will remain closed as a mark of respect. Emergency services, including an ambulance crew and helicopter, responded, but Mr. Stavers was declared dead a short time later despite the best efforts of medical staff.</p>

          <p>The 2026 midterm elections are proving exceptionally difficult to predict, with political analysts highlighting historical trends where the President's party typically loses seats, yet recent cycles have defied easy modeling. Key factors contributing to this uncertainty include ongoing redistricting battles in states like Texas and California, which could significantly alter the electoral map for both parties. Additionally, the potential impact of President Trump's relative unpopularity versus the Democratic party's "toxic" brand and declining registration remains unclear. The success or backlash from the GOP's "One, Big, Beautiful Bill" and various potential crises over the next 15 months further complicate any forecasts, making the outcome highly speculative.</p>

          <p>Internal Jesuit correspondence reveals that numerous officials within the Roman Catholic order were aware of priest Donald B Dickerson's history of sexually assaulting children but allowed his ordination and continued assignments. Despite warnings from some superiors, Dickerson received psychological treatment but was still ordained in 1980, leading to further allegations of sexual assault at various institutions. The ongoing Louisiana lawsuit against Loyola University and the Jesuit order highlights a systemic failure to address a known predator. Attorneys are now arguing that former superior general Pedro Arrupe, who is being considered for canonization, should not be sainthood due to his potential role in these decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans a significant overhaul of sentencing rules, introducing legislation that would empower courts to impose pub and travel bans on individuals convicted of crimes, as part of community sentences. These new penalties could apply to a wider range of offenses, extending beyond specific crime-related restrictions. The reforms also aim to reduce prison overcrowding by limiting short sentences and implementing a scheme for early release of well-behaved inmates, though serious offenders like those jailed for terror offenses would be excluded. While proponents believe these measures will deter crime, critics raise concerns about funding for enforcement and potential strain on probation services.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels while awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to expedite appeals, which currently take over a year on average, with 51,000 cases pending. This move comes amid increasing public pressure and protests across the UK against the use of asylum hotels. The Refugee Council, however, argues that the most effective way to reduce appeals is to improve the accuracy of initial asylum decisions, as about half of original rulings are overturned, suggesting judicial oversight is crucial for life-and-death decisions.</p>

Wolff also mentioned a separate incident where Trump reacted strongly to White House domestic staff changing his bedsheets.

          <p>Three young Sudanese sisters, aged nine, 11, and 17, tragically drowned in an overcrowded rubber boat carrying migrants across the central Mediterranean. The vessel, which departed from Libya's Zuwara city with about 65 people, began taking on water in rough seas. Rescuers from the German charity RESQSHIP found their bodies after hearing screams, with survivors, including the sisters' mother and brother, evacuated. Many survivors suffered severe chemical burns from the mixture of seawater and petrol. UN agencies report over 700 deaths in this crossing this year, urging increased search and rescue operations and guaranteed safety for disembarking survivors.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy defiantly vowed to continue fighting for freedom, stating Ukraine is a "fighter," not a victim, and seeks a "just peace" determined solely by its people. His address followed Russian claims of a Ukrainian drone attack sparking a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant, which Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation dismissed as Russian manipulation. The day also saw a prisoner swap of 146 soldiers from each side. International support was evident with Canadian PM Mark Carney pledging a $2bn military package and US envoy Keith Kellogg attending celebrations, as global leaders continue diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.</p>

Inspired by minimalist living, Kelly transformed an old utility trailer into a "closet-sized" home featuring a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, and solar-powered essentials like a mini-fridge and outdoor shower. He tested its resilience by staying in it during a snowstorm and camping with his son, proving that functional spaces can be created with minimal square footage through creative design.
