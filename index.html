          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 10:14:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, despite a significant 44% decline in net income compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.77, beating the $1.70 forecast, with revenue also topping estimates. A key factor in mitigating the impact of lower prices was record second-quarter production, including a notable jump in U.S. output. Chevron also expressed optimism that its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation will begin to positively contribute to earnings by the fourth quarter and help achieve significant cost reductions.

          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 73,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July, falling significantly short of economists' forecasts and raising concerns about the labor market's health amid escalating trade tensions. Compounding the weak report, job growth figures for May and June were revised downward by a substantial 258,000, indicating a more pronounced slowdown than previously understood. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.2%, with most gains concentrated in healthcare and social assistance, while long-term unemployment metrics worsened. This data suggests that recent tariff policies and a shifting cost structure for businesses are beginning to restrain hiring momentum across the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited a controversial aid distribution site in Gaza, which is backed by Israel and the U.S. The visit, conducted with the U.S. ambassador and the Israeli military, was intended to assess the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). This foundation replaced UN aid distribution and has been at the center of reports of deadly shootings, with the UN citing over 850 Palestinian deaths nearby, a figure the GHF disputes. Some Gazans criticized the visit as a "media stunt" that fails to address the severe hunger and ongoing conflict, while international access to the region remains restricted.</p>

          <p>A persistent malvertising campaign on Facebook is exploiting the reputation of well-known cryptocurrency platforms to distribute malware, according to security researchers at Bitdefender Labs. The deceptive ads often feature celebrity faces and mimic legitimate brands to trick users into clicking links that lead to fraudulent websites. These sites prompt victims to download what appears to be a desktop client, which instead installs a sophisticated malware system. The attackers use advanced filtering to evade detection, targeting users based on their interests in finance and technology, highlighting a significant challenge in Facebook's ad moderation process.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after eight children and one adult became ill during a summer camp at Stathern Lodge in Leicestershire, UK. All nine individuals were hospitalized but have since been discharged. The incident prompted a large emergency response, with local residents describing chaotic scenes as parents arrived at a village hall used as a triage center. Police were granted more time to question the suspect, who was discreetly arrested at a local pub. The police force has also referred itself to an independent watchdog over its handling of the initial report.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully adapted a 2,000-year-old anti-corrosion technique to significantly extend the service life of modern artillery barrels. The original method, observed on well-preserved bronze swords from the Terracotta Army, involved a thin layer of chromium salts. By refining this ancient process, scientists have developed a cutting-edge coating that combats the extreme heat, pressure, and chemical erosion that cause rapid wear and microcracking in high-velocity cannons. According to a defense tech journal, this innovation has effectively doubled the operational lifespan of the artillery, addressing a persistent challenge in modern weaponry.</p>

          <p>The future of Newcastle's star striker, Alexander Isak, is increasingly uncertain after the club rejected a significant bid from Liverpool. Isak, who has been a prolific goalscorer for Newcastle and was instrumental in their recent League Cup victory, is currently training separately from the team while recovering from a minor injury. While the club and manager Eddie Howe express a desire for him to stay, his perceived interest in leaving has frustrated some fans. A potential high-value sale, estimated around £150 million, would provide Newcastle with substantial funds to reinvest but would also leave a critical gap in their squad ahead of the new season. </p>

          <p>A major 2022 energy deal between Germany and Qatar is now at risk, as Qatar has threatened to halt liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments to Europe. The dispute centers on the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which requires large firms to address human rights and environmental issues in their supply chains, including climate transition plans. Qatari authorities argue the directive's rules and potential for heavy fines are overly burdensome and conflict with their national energy strategy. Any disruption to Qatari LNG, which has been a key replacement for Russian gas, could tighten European energy markets and lead to price surges. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order imposing higher tariffs on more than 60 countries, with the new duties set to take effect next week. The tariff rates range from 10% to as high as 41%, affecting a wide array of U.S. trading partners that have not yet secured a trade deal with the administration. The order separates countries into tiers based on their trade balance with the U.S., with larger deficits generally resulting in higher tariffs. This move formalizes threats made earlier this year and is expected to increase the cost of trade for most economies, creating further uncertainty for businesses and consumers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary environment, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that outpace inflation and preserve buying power. While national average CD yields remain low, top online banks are offering highly competitive rates, particularly on short-term CDs. For example, some one-year CDs are available with yields around 4.40% APY, and five-year terms can be found with rates up to 4.20% APY. To secure the best rates, experts advise looking at online banks, which have lower overhead, and considering a CD laddering strategy to balance high short-term yields with long-term savings goals.

          <p>Prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance are still facing high interest rates, though there is potential for them to stabilize or decline if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. As of August 1, 2025, the national average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.78%, while a 15-year mortgage averaged 6.00%. Refinance rates were slightly higher. To secure the best possible rate in the current market, financial experts advise borrowers to strengthen their credit profiles, with scores in the mid-to-high 700s being ideal. It is also crucial to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to hold interest rates steady. In a post on his social media platform, Trump called Powell a "stubborn MORON" and demanded an immediate, substantial rate cut. He further suggested that if Powell refuses, the Federal Reserve Board should "assume control" and implement the rate cuts itself. This direct attack on the Fed's independence comes as the administration navigates economic pressures from its own tariff policies and a cooling labor market, with Trump aiming to shift blame for any potential slowdown.</p>

          <p>At the urging of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map designed to secure five additional seats for the party in the next midterm elections. The proposed map accomplishes this by redrawing districts in South Texas and major metro areas to dilute the voting power of Democrats and Hispanic communities. While the plan would increase the number of majority-Hispanic districts, analysts note it does so in a way that favors Republican candidates by combining them with conservative white voters. The move comes amid an ongoing legal battle over the state's current map, which is already being challenged as an illegal gerrymander.</p>
