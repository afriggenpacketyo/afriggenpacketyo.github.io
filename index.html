          <p>The principal and two senior governing body members of the University of Dundee resigned after an independent report revealed a ¬£22 million government bailout due to financial mismanagement. The report cited poor financial judgment, weak governance, and a failure to address a significant drop in international student recruitment as key factors. The report criticized the university's leadership for not cultivating a culture of openness and challenge, and for an "overbearing leadership style" that discouraged criticism. University officials apologized for the stress and uncertainty caused to staff and students, while the Scottish government pledged to support the university's future.</p>

          <p>President Trump is weighing military options, including disabling Iran's Fordo nuclear site, due to concerns about Iran's nuclear weapons program. He approved attack plans but is hesitant pending potential negotiations with Iran, with a decision expected within two weeks. The UK is actively seeking a diplomatic resolution, while intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons. Trump stated he prefers making final decisions at the last moment due to the volatile nature of war, as Iran insists it will not negotiate under duress and will respond to any threat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security's trust funds are now projected to be depleted by 2034, one year earlier than previously forecast, potentially leading to benefit cuts of 19% to 23%. This acceleration is partly attributed to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Advocacy groups are urging Congress to act swiftly to shore up the program, either by raising revenue or cutting benefits, with potential solutions including lifting the income cap for payroll taxes or raising the retirement age. The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, meaning a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is now requiring lawmakers to provide 72 hours' notice before visiting detention centers, a move criticized as an attempt to block oversight of ICE facilities. This new guidance follows several tense visits by Democratic lawmakers to detention centers, some of whom were turned away, arrested, or allegedly assaulted. Critics argue that the new policy violates the 2024 Federal Appropriations Act, which allows lawmakers access to DHS facilities for inspections without prior notice.

The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army in 1862, emphasizing their daily routines and inner thoughts amidst the Montana wilderness. Eschewing grand speeches and metaphors, Minervini subtly highlights the economic inequalities, senseless brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to plague America. The film is an origin story for Minervini‚Äôs understated exploration of a nation still in conflict, despite the war's end.</p>

          <p>England is set to face India in a crucial Test series, marking a defining moment for the team under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. With ten Tests against India and Australia on the horizon, the series will determine whether England is remembered as ideological entertainers, glorious winners, or both. The outcome will heavily influence the future direction of the team and the legacies of Stokes and McCullum. Despite the high stakes, Stokes emphasizes focusing on the present and giving his all, rather than dwelling on external expectations.</p>

Destinations include Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport and El Paso, with some flights making stops in cities such as Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. ICE confirmed that it regularly flies deportees to countries in Central America and other parts of the world for special high-risk missions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to end the war over mineral wealth in eastern DRC. The deal, set to be signed in Washington, aims to end the fighting and attract American investment into the region, rich in minerals like coltan, cobalt, and gold. Critics are skeptical, as the M23 militia, believed to be backed by Rwanda, is not a signatory to the agreement. The deal includes provisions on territorial integrity, disarmament, and a joint security mechanism, potentially countering China's dominance in Africa's mineral sector.</p>

          <p>The presence of public pools is crucial for mental, physical, and social health, providing a space for recreation, exercise, and community building. Public pools have historically served as important social hubs, but segregation in the 1950s led to their decline as suburbanites retreated to private club pools. Revitalizing public pools by building them in unused spaces could significantly improve the well-being of city residents, especially during the hot summer months. Access to adequate bathing facilities is essential for the health, happiness, and efficiency of a large number of people.</p>

Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies emphasized the need to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products, while Conservative MS Janet Finch-Saunders highlighted the contribution of wipes to sewage blockages. Research from Cardiff University found that wet wipes pose a "significant risk" to the environment in Wales.</p>

Avoiding offense-seeking behavior and focusing on self-management can lead to a happier and more balanced life.</p>
