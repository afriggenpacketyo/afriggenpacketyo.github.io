          <p>The Trump administration expresses confidence in securing investors for the Alaska LNG project, despite its $40 billion price tag, emphasizing its national priority and potential to reduce trade deficits by selling energy to allies like Japan and South Korea. Energy Secretary Chris Wright highlights the project's staged construction, initially serving domestic demand, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum notes Department of Defense support through offtake agreements for Alaskan bases. However, energy analysts remain skeptical about the project's commercial viability, citing decades of planning without significant support. The administration's optimism contrasts with industry doubts about the project's economic logic. Optimism rests on securing commercial agreements and leveraging geopolitical factors.

          <p>A man in Boulder, Colorado, was taken into custody after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at a rally supporting Israeli hostages in Gaza, injuring twelve people. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, faces multiple felony charges and a federal hate crime charge, with authorities investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine!" during the attack, and investigators say he had been planning the attack for a year, researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube. The victims included four women and four men, ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one person initially in critical condition.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has demanded that California's public high schools confirm by June 9 that they do not allow transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports, escalating a federal inquiry into the state over its compliance with Title IX. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated that public school districts must "certify in writing" that they will not abide by the California Interscholastic Federation’s gender identity rules. This demand puts public school districts against the California Interscholastic Federation, the entity that schools are required to comply with to participate in state sports competitions. This action follows previous attempts by the Trump administration to enforce Title IX in a manner that excludes gender identity, setting the stage for potential legal battles over the interpretation of Title IX.</p>

          <p>A six-person Bulgarian cell was sentenced in London for their involvement in a plot to kill investigative journalist Christo Grozev, who had exposed Russian spies and the poisoning of Aleksei Navalny. The cell had been operating in England for over two years, gathering false identity documents and surveillance equipment, and spying on Grozev, journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a U.S. military base, and a former Russian law enforcement officer. This trial marks the first successful prosecution of Russian agents operating on British soil in recent history. The sentencing highlights the ongoing threat posed by the Kremlin to silence its opponents abroad, though the sentences may not be a strong deterrent.</p>

          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election saw a turnout of less than 13%, with President Claudia Sheinbaum still calling the election an “extraordinary” success. Only about 13% of 100 million eligible voters cast ballots in a vote that the president had labeled a key component of the ruling party’s ongoing “transformation” of Mexican society. The low participation is attributed to the election being an off-year event, a new and convoluted balloting process, and the obscurity of the candidates. Opponents are labeling the vote as a “Black Sunday,” and the end of judicial independence and of Mexico’s system of checks and balances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offices in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that the closures would hinder the USDA's ability to support California's agricultural sector, which received nearly $59.4 billion in cash receipts in 2023. While eight of the nine planned closures have been rescinded, the office in Mt. Shasta remains under discussion.

Both Databricks and Snowflake are counting on their respective deals to help them benefit from corporate spending to deliver artificial intelligence agents that carry out tasks on their own. The plan is to simplify the process of moving data into Snowflake with the new service so clients can more easily run queries on a larger supply of data, according to Christian Kleinerman, executive vice president of product at Snowflake.

          <p>The odds of a credit card interest rate decline this June are relatively low because The Federal Reserve has not issued an interest rate cut since December 2024. A higher federal funds rate, then, will essentially give credit card companies the coverage they need to keep rates high. Credit card rates are impacted by more than just the Federal Reserve. With inflation declining, interest rates frozen, stock market performance rising and falling and economic policies and strategies in flux right now, most credit card companies won't be rushing to reduce the rates they offer borrowers.
