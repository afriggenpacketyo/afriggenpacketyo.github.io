          <p>The Trump administration's $300 million White House ballroom construction project is drawing scrutiny over its private funding. President Trump asserts it's 100% privately funded, yet court documents reveal Google's parent company, Alphabet, contributed $22 million as part of a settlement. Donations are channeled through the Trust for the National Mall, a non-profit, raising questions about transparency and potential influence from major tech and crypto industry donors. The project's expanding cost and opaque donor list fuel concerns of a "pay-to-play" dynamic, prompting calls for greater accountability.</p>

Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed Singh, an Indian national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. Authorities are investigating the validity of his commercial driver's license. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about foreign truckers and prompted Florida to sue California and Washington over their commercial license issuance practices for undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring significant rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. Forecasts predict 5 to 10 inches of rain in some areas, raising concerns for flash flooding and landslides. While currently moving slowly west, Melissa could strengthen into a hurricane by Friday, though its precise path beyond the immediate Caribbean remains uncertain. The storm is not currently anticipated to impact the mainland United States, but vigilance is advised for the islands in its projected path.</p>

          <p>New York City's final mayoral debate was dominated by heated personal attacks between front-runners Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, rather than substantive policy discussions. Mamdani questioned Cuomo on past sexual harassment allegations and his governorship's failures, while Cuomo criticized Mamdani's lack of experience and alleged radical ties. The debate also touched on ICE raids and the safety of Jewish New Yorkers, with both candidates accusing the other of political opportunism. Observers noted the debate's intensity likely did little to shift voter opinions ahead of the election.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has for the first time attacked and destroyed alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Pacific, killing five people in two separate strikes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth equated the alleged drug cartels to terror groups like al-Qaida, signaling an expansion of the controversial campaign. The CIA is reportedly providing intelligence for these operations, which have drawn widespread condemnation from civil liberties groups and South American nations. Legal experts question the administration's justification, which cites a "non-international armed conflict" with "designated terrorist organizations."</p>

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island where they sheltered in a barn for nearly two days. A relative alerted authorities when they didn't return as expected, prompting a search. The son's quick thinking to use the boat's washed-up marine radio for a mayday call ultimately led to their rescue by helicopter. While one family member was in critical condition, the others were stable, highlighting the importance of emergency equipment and quick action in survival situations.</p>

          <p>Starting next year, NHS health checks in England for women aged 40 to 74 will officially include questions about menopause and its symptoms. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice and support, including treatments like hormone replacement therapy, hot-flush medications, and counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting hopes this move will bring menopause into mainstream health discussions and improve support, addressing the long-standing issue of women suffering in silence. Campaigners, however, stress the need to improve uptake, especially in marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to deploy over 100 federal agents to the San Francisco Bay Area for a major immigration enforcement operation. Agents are expected to use the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, prompting strong condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who likened the move to an "arsonist putting out the fire." Local leaders, including San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, have pledged to resist the militarized enforcement, enacting executive actions to support immigrant communities. This deployment marks San Francisco as the latest Democratic-run city targeted by the administration's aggressive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's promise to cut UK energy bills by £300 by 2030 is being questioned by the expert whose report underpinned the estimate. Economist Pawel Czyzak stated that his 2023 analysis needs updating due to changes in offshore wind costs and other factors, suggesting the projected savings could be "wiped out." The Tony Blair Institute also called for a shift from "Clean Power 2030" to "Cheaper Power 2030," advocating for measures like axing carbon taxes on gas. The UK government, however, maintains its commitment to lowering bills through clean energy. (not investment advice)</p>
