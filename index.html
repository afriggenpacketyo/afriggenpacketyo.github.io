          <p>Cattle ranchers in Texas are worried about the potential return of the screwworm, a parasitic fly, from the Mexican border. Ranchers are also concerned about President Trump's talk of importing beef from Argentina, which they view as a poor long-term solution. The USDA has closed the border to Mexico for live cattle imports intermittently since 2024 due to the screwworm. Ranchers emphasize the need for government support in preventing and eradicating the screwworm rather than manipulating markets, especially with the current low cattle inventory.

          <p>Two British prisoners, Lindsay Sandiford and Shahab Shahabadi, convicted of drug smuggling in Indonesia, are set to return to the UK following an agreement between the Indonesian and British governments. Sandiford, sentenced to death in 2013 for trafficking drugs, and Shahabadi, serving a life sentence, both suffer from serious health issues. The transfer, expected in about two weeks, comes despite the lack of a formal prisoner transfer arrangement between Indonesia and the UK. This move marks a significant development in the prisoners' long legal battles and personal struggles.</p>

          <p>General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson stated that the company expects its 2026 earnings to surpass those of 2025, which already exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company plans to continue repurchasing shares and aims to restore adjusted profit margins in North America to 8% to 10%. Analysts view these projections positively, suggesting a cultural shift within GM. GM's updated 2025 guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion.

These meteors originate from Halley's Comet and travel at approximately 41 miles per second, leaving long streaks of light. The best viewing conditions involve finding a dark spot away from city lights after midnight and looking towards the constellation of Orion. Viewers may also have a chance to see comets Lemmon or SWAN, as they are at their closest orbit to Earth on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>A third abuse survivor, known as "Elizabeth," has resigned from the government's inquiry into grooming gangs, joining Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds in protest. Elizabeth cited a "toxic environment for survivors" and feeling like the process was a "cover-up." Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips has denied these claims and said the government is committed to exposing failures. The resignations raise concerns about the inquiry's direction and the suitability of candidates to chair the inquiry.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean, with models showing multiple potential paths. While it's not expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, heavy rain, strong winds, flooding, and rough surf are possible for Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Cuba. The storm is currently producing winds up to 45 miles per hour, and the Weather Channel suggests three potential outcomes for its path. The storm is expected to slow down over the central Caribbean Sea, potentially becoming a long, drawn-out affair.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government experienced a shutdown after President Trump and congressional Republicans failed to agree on federal funding. This article outlines the 14 other times funding has lapsed since 1980, detailing the reasons for each shutdown, the duration, and the presidents and congressional control at the time. These shutdowns have stemmed from disagreements over spending cuts, aid to foreign entities, and policy disputes like the Affordable Care Act. The most recent lapse in government funding in late 2018 resulted in $3 billion in permanent losses.</p>

          <p>A document showing Prince Andrew's lease agreement for Royal Lodge reveals that he paid a token annual rent due to large lump sum payments made up-front for renovations. This arrangement explains how he can afford to live there despite not being a working royal. The King ended any financial support for his brother last year, and it is unclear how Andrew pays for upkeep and security. The lease includes clauses specifying that no helicopters are able to land there, and no gambling is allowed on the premises.</p>

          <h2>Germany's Syrian Deportation Plan Deemed 'Symbolic'</h2>

          <p>The German government's plan to deport Syrian war refugees is seen as purely symbolic due to legal and humanitarian reasons. Syria is at its limit and unable to take in more refugees, with millions already internally displaced. Humanitarian organizations cite a volatile security situation, widespread poverty, and a lack of infrastructure as reasons against deportations. Despite this, the German government insists that those who commit crimes in Germany and do not have a right of residence should return to their home countries.</p>

          <p>A tiny chip and special glasses are restoring vision for those with macular degeneration. Over 80% of patients in trials showed significant improvement in central vision after a year of monitoring. The implant compensates for deterioration in the macula, while specialized eyeglasses transmit visual data to the implant. The technology has been acquired by Science Corporation and is seeking approval from the FDA and CE certification for use as a medical therapy.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, along with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, are in Israel to shore up the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas has denied responsibility for an alleged attack that killed two Israeli soldiers, but Netanyahu stated that it was a Hamas attack. Despite the violence, the peace process has taken incremental steps forward, with Israel returning the remains of 15 Palestinians to Gaza. However, the long-term viability of President Trump's peace plan remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Boris Johnson told the Covid inquiry that children paid a "huge price" to protect others during the pandemic, apologizing for government errors. He defended the actions of teachers and schools, acknowledging the "unbelievably difficult" circumstances.

He also addressed the exam results fiasco of August 2020, expressing a "thoroughly homicidal mood" at the time.</p>

          <p>Tech CEOs are making ambitious claims about AI's coding capabilities, but some software engineers are skeptical. While AI tools have changed how coding works for some developers, many engineers report mixed results, with some citing messy, unusable code generated by AI. Researchers have even coined the term "workslop" to describe situations where AI use results in more work for colleagues. Despite the hype, AI in software engineering may not mean a new age of automation.</p>

          <p>States are warning that SNAP benefits may be delayed in November if the government shutdown continues. The USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors, opening the door to possible disruptions. Advocates warn the effects could be devastating for the over 40 million Americans enrolled in SNAP. The USDA has contingency funds, but it's unclear if they will be used to ensure November SNAP benefits.</p>

          <p>Questions are being raised about President Trump's competence due to his frequent confusing speeches and incorrect claims. Experts and Democrats are questioning what guardrails exist to remove an impeded commander-in-chief from office. Removal options include impeachment and Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, neither of which have ever been used to remove a president. Section 4 requires agreement from the Vice President and a majority of the cabinet, followed by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate.</p>

          <p>Gavin Plumb, jailed for plotting to kidnap, sexual assault, and murder TV presenter Holly Willoughby, has failed in his appeal against his sentence.
