          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of US strikes on nuclear sites in Iran, world leaders have reacted with varied responses.

Venezuela and Cuba condemned the attacks, while Mexico called for diplomatic dialogue to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East, as South Korea plans an emergency meeting to discuss the implications of the attack.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted precision strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating America's involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. U.S. Navy submarines launched Tomahawk missiles into Iran, and Trump stated that the U.S. and Israel worked closely together in the operation. Trump warned Iran of further attacks if it does not pursue peace, while also stating that the objective was to eliminate the nuclear threat posed by the country. Experts suggest Iran might retaliate by disrupting oil tanker traffic in the Strait of Hormuz, which could significantly impact the global economy.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are increasingly seeking remote and adventurous travel experiences, often inspired by social media trends, and are willing to spend lavishly to disconnect from urban life and immerse themselves in nature.

          <p>President Trump, who previously pledged to be a peacemaker, authorized a direct military strike on Iran, targeting nuclear sites and breaking his promises to avoid new wars. The operation involved dropping bombs on the Fordow site, prompting Iranian state media to report casualties and infrastructure damage. This action contrasts with Trump's earlier vows to prevent World War Three and end chaos in the Middle East, as concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions clash with his promises of peace. While Trump cited his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal as evidence of his tough stance, the recent strike puts his peace promises under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military attacked three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel's effort to dismantle the country's nuclear program. The Iranian government did not immediately acknowledge the attacks, but state news reported an attack on the Fordo nuclear plant. The decision to involve the U.S. comes after more than a week of Israeli attacks, and Trump stated that a full load of bombs was dropped on the primary site. Trump had previously warned of irreparable damage to the U.S. if it attacked the Islamic Republic, and the military action is a dangerous decision for both Iran and Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities is fraught with risks, despite his claim of a "very successful" attack. The move follows a short deadline given to Iran for negotiations, raising questions about the sincerity of diplomatic efforts. Iran had previously warned of reprisals if the U.S. joined Israel in attacking its territory, and now the waiting game begins to see how Iran will respond. The action has also drawn criticism from both Democrats and members of Trump's own base, highlighting domestic political concerns alongside international security issues.</p>

The city's stock market is benefiting from capital flight to Asia, with numerous enterprises, including mainland companies, preparing for public listings. State policies and local government actions are bolstering Hong Kong's position as a global financial hub, however, there is a risk of Hong Kong splitting up into two economies. While the financial sector is soaring, it is important to consider the food and retail sector.</p>

          <p>The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, restricted Iran‚Äôs nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, signed in 2015 by Iran, the U.S., and other world powers. The deal aimed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but President Trump withdrew the U.S. in 2018, reimposing sanctions. Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time for accumulating enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. While some provisions of the JCPOA were set to expire, efforts to negotiate a return to the agreement have stalled.</p>
