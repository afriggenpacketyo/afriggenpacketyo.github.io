          <p>The Trump administration's deadline for Russia to cease its invasion of Ukraine is approaching, with the White House considering steep "secondary tariffs" on Russia's trade partners as a penalty. The article details ongoing, sensitive diplomatic efforts to broker a peace deal, including a recent meeting between a U.S. special envoy and President Putin. However, progress is complicated by Russia's maximalist demands, which include retaining annexed Ukrainian territory and securing a commitment that Ukraine will not join the NATO alliance.</p>

The move came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association raised concerns that a 39% tariff on Swiss exports was being applied to 1kg and 100oz gold bars, which could disrupt the international flow of physical gold. The clarification from the White House caused the precious metal's price to drop, easing immediate market fears. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Canyon fire, has forced thousands of evacuations in a mountainous region of Southern California, spanning both Ventura and Los Angeles counties. The blaze grew quickly due to record-low moisture levels and high temperatures, though firefighters made some progress overnight, achieving 25% containment. The incident occurs as another major wildfire rages in central California, with officials warning that wildfire risk will remain elevated across the state due to an intensifying heatwave.</p>
