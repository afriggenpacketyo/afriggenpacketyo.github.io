          <p>The U.S. Senate has initiated voting on a significant and controversial spending bill championed by the Trump administration. The legislation, which includes substantial tax cuts and new borrowing, faces deep divisions within Congress, particularly concerning proposed cuts to welfare and healthcare programs. Democrats have uniformly opposed the measure, while internal Republican disagreements have created uncertainty around its passage. The bill's progression remains tense as it requires near-unanimous support from the Republican majority to overcome procedural hurdles and pass. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were identified as the biggest winners in the Federal Reserve's 2025 stress tests, which assess how major banks would handle a hypothetical economic crisis. Both banks saw their stress capital buffer requirements lowered more significantly than their peers, a positive regulatory development. This easing of capital requirements could allow the firms to increase shareholder returns through dividends and stock buybacks, as well as pursue more loan growth and new investments. The results are seen as evidence of a more favorable regulatory environment for large banks under the current administration. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has found significant disparities in how police forces across England and Wales handle cases of coercive or controlling behaviour, a decade after it was made a crime. Survivors report having to act as their own detectives, gathering extensive evidence themselves due to what they describe as inadequate police response and understanding of the offense. The report highlights that some forces log three times more of these crimes than others, suggesting inconsistent recognition and prioritization. This lack of a standardized approach is leading to poor outcomes for victims and, in some cases, tragic consequences.</p>

The dollar's weakness has pushed it to its lowest level since March 2022 and has boosted other currencies, such as the pound sterling, to multi-year highs.
