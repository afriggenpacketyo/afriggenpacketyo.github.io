          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping following Beijing's decision to expand export controls on rare earth elements. In a social media post, Trump condemned China's move as "hostile" and a threat to global industries, stating it removes the incentive for their scheduled talks at the APEC summit. He warned that the United States possesses its own monopoly positions that are far more powerful than China's, which he has not yet chosen to leverage. The statement marks a significant escalation in the ongoing trade and strategic rivalry between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a major policy proposal to offer universal childcare for all children aged nine months to four years if it wins the next Senedd election. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth described the plan as a "transformative" policy that would provide families with at least 20 hours of care for 48 weeks a year by 2031. This initiative aims to alleviate financial pressure on families, as high childcare costs have been identified as a driver of poverty. The plan would significantly expand current provisions, which are largely limited to working parents or specific geographic areas.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Deportation Plans for Salvadoran Man Face Federal Court Scrutiny</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 11:14:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is facing scrutiny in federal court over its plans to deport Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia for a second time. A judge has ordered the administration to provide a witness who can clarify the details of the planned removal to Eswatini, as his criminal case for human smuggling continues in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported earlier this year despite having a legal status protecting him from removal to El Salvador due to likely persecution. His lawyers argue his prolonged detention is illegal, citing a Supreme Court precedent against indefinite confinement for individuals awaiting deportation.</p>

          <p>At least six people have died after two powerful earthquakes, with magnitudes of 7.4 and 6.7, struck off the coast of the southern Philippines. The quakes caused significant shaking in the Mindanao region, leading to building collapses, including a gold mine shaft where three miners were killed. Authorities initially issued tsunami warnings for the Philippines, Palau, and Indonesia, but these were later lifted. The event has left communities shaken, with hundreds of aftershocks recorded and infrastructure damage being assessed across the affected areas, highlighting the region's vulnerability to seismic activity.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Overview of U.S. Government Shutdowns Since 1980</h2>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become more frequent over the past four decades. Before 1980, federal agencies often continued operating during funding gaps, but legal opinions from that era established that they lacked the authority to do so. This article provides a history of the 14 government shutdowns since then, from the brief, one-day closures during the Reagan administration to the 34-day partial shutdown in 2018 under President Trump. These events have been triggered by disputes over issues ranging from budget cuts and policy riders to immigration and healthcare.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown persists, federal workers are voicing growing concerns about their financial stability and the disruption to public services. Many employees, whether furloughed or required to work without pay, are anxious about how long the funding lapse will last, with some anticipating the need to take on debt to cover basic living expenses. Workers also express frustration that critical government functions, such as labor dispute investigations, are halted, preventing citizens from accessing justice. The shutdown is described as taking a significant psychological toll and creating a sense of "moral injury" among dedicated public servants.</p>

          <p>More than 6,000 civilian staff members of London's Metropolitan Police are set to take industrial action after voting to strike in a dispute over pay. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union members are demanding the same £1,250 London allowance that is paid to police officers, which they were denied. The union's general secretary stated that police staff will not accept being treated as "second-class citizens." The Met Police responded that pay structures for officers and staff are fundamentally different and that it cannot justify the additional spending amid a significant budget gap, but remains open to finding a solution.</p>

          <p>A recent HSBC survey of high-net-worth business owners found that 57% are considering moving to a new country within the next year. The primary motivations are not tax efficiency, but rather the pursuit of new business and investment opportunities, a better quality of life, and improved education for their families. Singapore emerged as the most popular potential destination, followed by the UK, Japan, and Switzerland. The findings suggest that for the global entrepreneurial elite, lifestyle and growth prospects are increasingly more important factors than traditional tax incentives when choosing a place to live and work.

The judge dismissed Franco's claim of self-defense as a lie, noting that CCTV footage showed the victim posed no threat. Ahmad's family described him as an ambitious young man who had moved to the UK to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor.</p>

          <p>Ocean freight carriers are facing uncertainty and potential financial disruption as new U.S. government port fees on Chinese-built vessels are set to take effect. The rules have created confusion over how ship financing from Chinese lessors will be classified, with some Western shipowners scrambling to refinance deals to avoid being identified as Chinese-controlled. China commands over 60% of the global shipbuilding market, and Chinese firms are also major players in ship financing, with portfolios estimated at over $100 billion. The lack of clear guidance from the U.S. Trade Representative is forcing companies to reassess their financial structures to mitigate risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by the WHO and the UN has identified a global pattern of criminal activity as the cause of more than 20 recent child deaths in India from contaminated cough syrup.

The report highlights how criminals exploit regulatory gaps in the global supply chain, refilling and selling drums of the poisonous liquid with falsified documentation. This recurring tragedy, which has claimed over 1,300 lives globally over 90 years, underscores the urgent need for stronger international oversight and enforcement.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will require non-EU citizens, including those from the UK, to register biometric data such as fingerprints and a facial image upon their first entry into the 29-country Schengen Area. This digital registration, valid for three years, will eventually replace manual passport stamping. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns about potential delays and queues at major transit points like Dover and Eurostar terminals during the initial rollout phase.</p>
