          <p>Circle Internet Group announced a 53% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter revenue, reaching $658.1 million, largely fueled by significant growth in its USDC stablecoin. The circulation of USDC grew by 90% to $61.3 billion, reflecting strong market demand and increased engagement from major financial institutions following supportive new crypto legislation. Despite a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the company's shares rose, and it announced plans for a new blockchain called Arc for stablecoin payments. The positive market reception highlights growing confidence in the role of stablecoins within the evolving financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a 45-year-old American woman, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court. Prosecutors detailed how she flew to the UK as a would-be assassin in a plot to kill a shopkeeper, though the firearm she used jammed during the attempt. The crime was part of a violent feud orchestrated by two co-conspirators who had a dispute with the victim's family. After the failed shooting, Betro fired shots at the victim's empty home before fleeing back to the US, from where she was later extradited to face justice.</p>

          <p>In an interview, neuroscientist Chris Nowinski discusses the complexities of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and the process of brain donation for research, particularly in the context of the recent shooting at the NFL's headquarters. Nowinski, who co-founded the Boston University Brain Bank, explains how brains are procured for study and the ethical considerations involved. He also critiques the NFL's handling of the CTE crisis, suggesting the league's financial influence over media has dampened public outrage. The article highlights that while the NFL has made some safety changes, the risk of CTE remains a significant and under-discussed issue at college and high school levels.</p>

          <p>The United States is grappling with its largest measles outbreak in thirty years, a crisis exacerbated by declining childhood vaccination rates for the fifth consecutive year. This public health challenge is compounded by the Trump administration's policies, which have undermined trust and funding for scientific institutions like the CDC and NIH. The article details how key officials have fostered vaccine skepticism, canceled funding for vaccine research, and dismantled global health initiatives like USAID. These actions risk long-term damage to public health infrastructure and trust, potentially leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases on a wider scale.</p>

The posts included false claims about the January 6 insurrection being a "Democrat plot," derogatory remarks about Vice President Kamala Harris, and baseless conspiracy theories.

Analysts believe that the underlying trade tensions and the unlikelihood of tariffs being completely eliminated will continue to weigh on US import volumes from China. The Shanghai Containerised Freight Index has already shown a steady decline for nine consecutive weeks, with rates to the US falling by more than half since June. Major carriers like Maersk have reported significant year-on-year declines in their China-US container volumes, indicating a lasting realignment of global trade flows. (not investment advice)</p>

According to a Morgan Stanley analysis, this trend could transform the market from a Meituan monopoly into a duopoly. The bank projects that by 2030, Alibaba and Meituan could hold nearly equal shares of the on-demand delivery market, signaling a significant and lasting change in the competitive landscape.

This surge in crime, which pharmacists describe as including both petty theft and organized attempts to access dispensaries, is forcing businesses to spend money on security measures like CCTV and guards.

This issue is compounded by rising smoking rates targeted by tobacco companies.

Coote, who was dismissed by the refereeing body PGMOL in December 2024 following an investigation, admitted to the charge and expressed deep remorse for his actions. In addition to the suspension, he is required to complete a mandatory face-to-face education program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led legislature in Missouri has repealed a paid sick leave mandate that was approved by 58% of the state's voters in a recent ballot initiative. The law, which also included minimum wage increases, was a top priority for repeal by the Missouri Chamber of Commerce. Workers and labor advocacy groups have strongly condemned the move, arguing that lawmakers chose to side with corporate greed over the will of the people and the health of the workforce. The repeal is seen as a devastating blow to low-wage workers who fought for the protections, and efforts are now underway to prevent legislators from overturning future voter-approved initiatives.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's decision to federalize the Washington, D.C. police force, arguing that the move is a political show of force that ignores data showing a 30-year low in violent crime. Civil rights advocates and legal experts warn that deploying the National Guard and federalizing local police under a pretextual emergency is an invitation for abuse and police lawlessness. The action is framed as part of a broader pattern of disempowering Black-led cities and highlights the unique vulnerability of D.C. due to its lack of statehood. Critics view it as a dangerous overreach of federal power that prioritizes ideology over effective, evidence-based crime reduction strategies.</p>

          <p>Tesla has begun taking orders in China for a new, longer-range version of its Model 3 electric vehicle, priced 14% higher than the basic edition. The new variant boasts a driving range of 830km and features a high-performance battery from LG Energy Solution. This launch comes as the American automaker faces escalating competition and a recent decline in its mainland China deliveries, which fell 8.4% year-over-year in July. The introduction of a premium Model 3 appears to be a strategic move by Tesla to enhance its product lineup and defend its market position in the world's largest and most competitive EV market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that while President Trump's claims about crime in Washington, D.C. may be exaggerated, the city does have a serious and long-standing violence problem that recent statistics can obscure. Although overall violent crime has declined, the city's murder rate was rising even before the pandemic and remains significantly higher than in other major cities like New York. The analysis highlights that violence is hyper-concentrated in the city's poorest wards, where homicide rates for young Black men are comparable to those of combatants in war zones. The piece suggests that a focused strategy targeting the specific people and places driving violence is necessary to address the profound issue.</p>

The article explores the reasons for this stark contrast, pointing to lineup adjustments and players finding form as potential factors.

          <p>India's consumer inflation rate fell to 1.55% in July, marking the ninth consecutive month of decline and reaching its lowest level since June 2017. The drop, which was below economists' estimates, was primarily driven by a continued decrease in food price growth. This benign inflation outlook, as noted by the Reserve Bank of India, could provide the central bank with more flexibility to implement a looser monetary policy. Such a move could help bolster India's economy as it navigates challenges from global trade tensions, particularly the aggressive tariff policies enacted by the United States.

          <p>European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in genuine negotiations at his upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, she believes Putin's primary goals are to secure a photo opportunity with Trump and to achieve a postponement of sanctions. Kallas expressed deep skepticism about the talks, emphasizing that any potential deal regarding the war in Ukraine would be impractical and illegitimate without the direct involvement of both Ukraine and Europe. Her comments reflect growing concern among European leaders that they are being sidelined from a crucial discussion with major implications for regional security.</p>

          <p>The latest official figures from the UK suggest a continued cooling of the labor market, as job vacancies fell by 5.8% to 718,000 between May and July. The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest drop, falling for the 10th time in the last 12 months, with the decline concentrated in the hospitality and retail sectors. Despite this slowdown, average wage growth remained steady at 5%, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%. Economists interpret the data as a signal of a very gradual cooling rather than a sharp downturn, though it reflects caution among employers in recruiting new staff. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. and Russian presidents prepare to meet in Alaska, this article provides historical context on the summit's location, which was part of the Russian Empire until 1867. Russia sold the territory to the United States for $7.2 million, a deal viewed at the time as a financial liability for a struggling empire and a foolish purchase of a frozen wilderness by American critics. The sale was driven by Russia's fears of British naval power and its need for cash after the Crimean War. The discovery of gold and oil later transformed the acquisition into one of history's great bargains, a unique backdrop for the high-stakes diplomatic talks.</p>
