          <p>Representative Andy Ogles is calling for an investigation into Belmont University, a private Christian school in Tennessee, following the release of leaked recordings. In the recordings, a university official allegedly admits to rebranding its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives to circumvent a federal directive, while also enrolling undocumented students. Ogles accuses the university of creating a "clever scheme" to continue a "radical agenda" and potentially violating state law. Belmont University has denied operating a "shadow operation" and maintains it is in compliance with all federal laws.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility resulted in the tragic deaths of three deputies. The incident occurred while the deputies, members of the elite Arson Explosives Detail, were working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a separate location. Sheriff Robert Luna described the event as the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, noting the three officers had a combined 74 years of service. Federal and local agencies are assisting in the ongoing investigation, though officials have confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally filed a motion to unseal grand jury records related to the federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. This action follows a directive from President Trump and comes amid significant public and political pressure for greater transparency in the high-profile case. The filing states that while the DOJ stands by its previous conclusions, releasing the transcripts serves the public interest, subject to redactions to protect victim identities. This move occurs as President Trump also engages in a public dispute with the Wall Street Journal over its reporting on his alleged connections to Epstein.</p>

          <p>Tom Michael, the general manager of Boise State Public Radio, explains the significant negative consequences that the recent federal defunding of public media will have, particularly on rural communities. He highlights that these stations often serve as a primary source of local news, emergency alerts, and educational content in areas where other media options are scarce. Michael argues that the loss of funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting will likely force many smaller stations to reduce programming or shut down entirely. This creates an information vacuum and diminishes a trusted community institution that connects isolated populations across the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal, its parent company News Corp, and owner Rupert Murdoch over an article concerning his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit stems from a report that Trump sent a sexually suggestive birthday letter to Epstein in 2003, which included a sketch of a naked woman. Trump has strongly denied writing the letter, calling it fake and an attack on him. This legal action comes as Trump's connection to Epstein faces renewed scrutiny, even among his own supporters, and follows his administration's recent move to unseal related grand jury transcripts.</p>

          <p>A Cleveland Police dog named PD Bert, who participated in the security operations for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, has died from injuries sustained in a car crash. The five-year-old springer spaniel was in a police vehicle with an officer and another dog when it collided with a BMW in Hartlepool. PD Bert, a specialized sniffer dog trained to detect drugs, cash, and firearms, was put to sleep due to the severity of his injuries. The officer suffered minor injuries, and the other police dog was unharmed. A 33-year-old man has been charged with drink driving in connection with the incident.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has revised its internal practices to ensure that its engineers based in China will no longer provide technical support for the company's U.S. Department of Defense cloud clients. The change was announced in response to national security concerns highlighted in a recent ProPublica report, which detailed the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese engineers managed by U.S.-based "digital escorts." The move impacts Microsoft's Azure cloud services division, a significant source of the company's revenue, and is intended to mitigate potential cybersecurity risks associated with having foreign nationals supporting sensitive government contracts.</p>

He also addressed the controversial practice of ICE agents wearing masks during arrests, stating that while he is not a proponent, he will allow it to continue for the safety of his officers.

          <p>Taiwanese officials and businesses are anxiously awaiting the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States regarding potential tariffs. The Trump administration had previously announced a 32% tariff on Taiwan but paused it for 90 days to allow for negotiations with key trading partners. Analysts believe the fact that no final decision has been announced indicates that the two sides are actively trying to reach a deal to keep new tariffs at a manageable level. Taiwan, a major supplier of advanced semiconductors to top American tech firms, maintains a substantial trade surplus with the U.S., which is the primary driver of the administration's tariff policy.</p>

          <p>Several prominent Democratic politicians are condemning CBS's decision to cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," suggesting the move may be politically motivated. The announcement came just days after Colbert criticized the network's parent company, Paramount, for settling a $16 million lawsuit with Donald Trump and called the payment a "big fat bribe." Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among others, questioned the timing and called for transparency. In a joint statement, Paramount and CBS insisted the cancellation was a "purely a financial decision" and unrelated to the show's content or other corporate matters.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, deeming him a flight risk as he faces charges of plotting a coup. The court also imposed a curfew and barred him from contacting foreign diplomats or using social media. The decision escalates a feud between Brazil and the U.S., as President Trump has demanded the case be dropped and threatened tariffs if the prosecution continues. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has rejected the threats as "blackmail," and the confrontation has reportedly boosted his domestic popularity amid rising nationalist sentiment.</p>

          <p>The latest big-screen adaptation of "Smurfs" is being panned by critics as a strained and chaotic film that fails to capture the charm of the original characters. The review describes the movie as an overwhelming barrage of gags, colors, and songs that feel random and unearned, with a needlessly complicated plot involving multiverses and cosmic guardians. While the voice cast includes stars like Rihanna, John Goodman, and James Corden, the story is considered incoherent and unimaginative. The article suggests that even moments of creative animation cannot save the film from its reliance on textbook CGI action and underdeveloped themes.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece argues that members of the U.S. Congress are increasingly failing to exercise their constitutional authority, effectively surrendering power to the executive branch. The article cites recent examples, such as senators publicly criticizing legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act but then voting for it, as evidence of "preening cowardice." The author suggests that lawmakers vote for bills they dislike while hoping they won't be enacted as written, a phenomenon dubbed the "Vote Yes/Hope No Caucus." This abdication of responsibility, the article concludes, has enabled a significant expansion of presidential power.</p>

Their religious practices are largely secret, conversion is not permitted, and intermarriage is strongly discouraged. A core tenet of their social doctrine is the defense of fellow Druze, fostering a tight-knit community that has historically navigated complex political landscapes to ensure its survival.</p>
