          <p>Peter Sullivan, now 68, was exonerated after spending over 38 years in jail for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall in Birkenhead, in what is believed to be the biggest miscarriage of justice in British history. Sullivan and his defense team maintained his innocence, asserting that police arrested the wrong man. New forensic testing revealed a DNA profile from a semen sample that did not match Sullivan, leading to his conviction being overturned. Merseyside Police has reopened the investigation into Ms. Sindall's murder, seeking DNA samples from individuals identified in 1986.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing legislation that includes significant Medicaid cuts, despite facing resistance from within their own party. The bill aims to cut Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, increasing eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to unauthorized immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the health portions would save about $715 billion, but at least 8.6 million more Americans will go uninsured. The legislation also includes a permanent extension of Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act and a $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, raising concerns about its long-term impact.</p>

Some attendees have reported negative experiences, including chaotic VIP sections and obstructed views, while others emphasize the unique energy of large gatherings. The economics favor artists, who can maximize revenue, but the fan experience can be compromised.</p>

          <p>Following recent trade talks between the US and China, both nations have claimed victory after import duties were reduced. However, analysts suggest Beijing emerged with the upper hand, having consolidated its position as a global counterweight to Washington. China entered negotiations from a position of strength, having learned from previous dealings with Trump. The agreement's real significance lies in the performative dimension of power projection, which could prove more valuable over the long term than immediate economic gains.</p>

          <p>A group of small businesses is challenging President Trump's sweeping tariffs in the Court of International Trade, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to unilaterally impose such tariffs. The businesses claim they rely on imports and would be harmed by Trump's actions, describing the national emergency used to justify the tariffs as a "figment of his own imagination." The Department of Justice argues that Congress permits the president to impose tariffs, and Trump's invoking of a national emergency broadens his power.</p>

The essay suggests that Trump's shamelessness is a form of confidence and strength, reinforcing loyalty among his base, while Democrats' efforts to address inequalities can inadvertently reinforce perceptions that the system picks favorites.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's 2024 victory, a debate has reignited among economists and policymakers regarding the role of 'neoliberal' economic policies. Some argue that Biden's 'post-neoliberalism' approach, with increased government intervention, failed to win back the working class. Critics contend that Biden's economic policies caused inflation and failed to deliver tangible benefits. Defenders argue that external factors, such as the pandemic, were more influential. The outcome of this debate will shape future economic agendas and strategies for winning back working-class support.</p>

GM anticipates that this groundbreaking innovation will reduce costs and boost the profitability of its largest electric SUVs and trucks, starting with models like the Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ in 2028. The new batteries utilize more prevalent and less expensive minerals like manganese, reducing the reliance on cobalt and nickel commonly used in current EV batteries. GM aims to be the first to market with this technology, following Ford's announcement of similar LMR batteries before 2030.</p>
