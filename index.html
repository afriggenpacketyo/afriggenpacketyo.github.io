          <p>Marks and Spencer has resumed online orders after suspending them in April due to a major cyberattack.

The retailer has been working to restore its services since the attack, which caused empty shelves and delivery delays.

          <p>Amid growing concerns about sabotage and espionage, Germany plans to increase its use of artificial intelligence in national security. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that AI must be used more extensively in intelligence services to defend against hybrid threats, which are constantly increasing. The government acknowledges the growing number of attacks on infrastructure, including civilian facilities and military sites, and will allocate substantial financial resources to strengthen the defense mechanisms of Germany's security agencies. The move aims to enhance Germany's technical, legal, and organizational capabilities in the face of evolving threats.</p>

          <p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom for his handling of the recent protests in Los Angeles following ICE arrests of illegal immigrants. Bianco accused Newsom of encouraging the unrest and failing to support law enforcement's efforts to address the situation. The Department of Homeland Security highlighted the criminal histories of several arrested migrants, including convictions for murder and sexual assault, while condemning Democrat politicians for their rhetoric against ICE. ICE stated that it has arrested 2,000 illegal immigrants per day this week and will not be deterred by violent activists.</p>

          <p>China's restrictions on rare earth exports are impacting Western defense giants, particularly in the construction of F-35 fighter jets, according to analysts. China, the leader in critical mineral supply chains, imposed these restrictions in response to U.S. tariffs. While some progress has been made with licenses granted in sectors connected with robotics and electric vehicles, access to rare earth minerals like samarium, essential for magnets, remains vital for defense technologies. Experts suggest that the U.S., EU, and Australia must coordinate supply- and demand-side interventions to boost rare earths production to mitigate the impact.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has suggested that the state will sue the Trump administration over the deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid ICE protests, calling the move illegal and an abuse of power. Newsom stated that the Marines are not political pawns and that the deployment undermines checks and balances. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDowell expressed concern over the logistical challenges posed by the deployment and emphasized the need for clear coordination among agencies. The Trump administration argues that the deployment is necessary to protect federal property and ICE agents from violence, while Newsom maintains that state and local agencies can manage the protests.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles to address elevated prices of the staple food, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. The released rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness. The government aims to distribute the rice to smaller supermarket chains and specialty shops to lower prices for consumers.</p>

Despite providing a $400 million oil-backed loan, Niger has expelled Chinese oil executives and revoked the license of a Chinese-owned hotel, citing discriminatory practices. The disputes highlight the limits of Beijing's non-interference policy, which avoids entanglement in domestic affairs but can incur economic costs.

          <p>China is tapping into its 10.9 trillion yuan ($1.5 trillion) housing provident fund to support its struggling housing sector. This fund, a government savings program, offers an alternative to bank mortgages, providing loans at lower interest rates. The fund's importance is growing as banks become more cautious due to profit challenges, with outstanding mortgages reaching 8.1 trillion yuan last year. While this effort aims to ease financing needs for borrowers, some analysts remain skeptical that it will be sufficient to drive a full housing recovery, as it does not address the fundamental issue of demand shortage.

The government aims to step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across a range of fields.

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments, partly to offset losses from high US tariffs. Shipments to Vietnam increased by 18.8% from January to May, while exports to Thailand grew by 20.9%, and Indonesia saw a 16.8% increase. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping to factory sites in Southeast Asia to produce finished goods for local sale or re-export to Western countries, including the US, potentially avoiding tariffs. These trends indicate a diversification of exports and closer economic ties between China and Southeast Asian countries.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the Trump administration to block the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines in response to protests in Los Angeles. Newsom argues that the deployment violates federal law and state sovereignty, stating that the city would have been "completely obliterated" if he had not deployed the Guard. While the Guard is present, their interactions with protesters have been minimal, as local law enforcement continues to manage crowd control.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to anti-ICE protests has sparked concerns about the limits of executive power and the militarization of domestic law enforcement. Critics, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, have accused Trump of authoritarianism and intentionally causing chaos. Human rights lawyer Philippe Sands suggests the administration is testing the public's tolerance for such actions, which could normalize the use of military force against citizens. The situation raises questions about the resilience of checks and balances in the face of executive overreach.</p>

          <p>The head of the Panama Canal, Ricaurte Vasquez, has voiced concerns that the sale of two ports near the canal to a consortium led by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) could threaten the canal's neutrality. Vasquez stated that a significant concentration of terminal operators belonging to a single shipping company could harm Panama's competitiveness. MSC is a leading global container shipping group and the proposed sale has also drawn attention from U.S. President Donald Trump, who seeks to reduce Chinese influence around the canal. Vasquez suggested that the canal should consider becoming a terminal operator itself by reactivating a project to build a terminal in the Port of Corozal.</p>

          <p>A recall on cases of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded due to a serious health risk. The cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were mislabeled as "zero sugar" but contained the full amount of sugar, around 39 grams. The recalled cans, with product code XXXXRS05165 and a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, such as diabetics, and customers are urged to return the product for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting a loophole in Europe's drug classification system to smuggle ketamine, swapping it for substances like salt during transit. In some European countries, ketamine is regulated as a medicine, leading to less scrutiny during import and transit, while in others, it is classified as a narcotic. This has led to a surge in ketamine consumption and related deaths, with organized crime groups profiting more from ketamine than other illegal drugs like cocaine. The preferred smuggling route involves shipping ketamine from India through Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium before reaching the UK.</p>
