          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has publicly defended its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project against escalating attacks from the Trump administration. In response to criticisms of an "ostentatious overhaul," the central bank launched a new FAQ webpage to clarify the project's scope and necessity, stating it preserves historic buildings and is not funded by taxpayers. The defense comes amid a broader campaign by the administration to pressure Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and suggests the central bank is preparing to resist political interference.</p>

          <p>India's External Affairs Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, made his first visit to China in five years for high-level diplomatic discussions. Chinese officials urged both nations to respect each other's concerns on "thorny issues" to ensure stable relations. Jaishankar expressed confidence in the positive trajectory of the talks, highlighting the recent resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra pilgrimage as a significant step. The visit aims to continue the normalization of ties that have been strained by border tensions and the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has accepted an invitation from King Charles III for a second state visit to the UK, an unprecedented honor for a second-term U.S. president. The visit is scheduled for September and will be hosted at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace is undergoing renovations. This trip is seen as a significant exercise in soft diplomacy by the British government, aiming to strengthen the "special relationship" amid ongoing discussions about trade and the war in Ukraine. Senior members of the Royal Family are expected to participate in the ceremonial events.</p>

          <p>The British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan has sparked a major controversy over free speech after leading pro-Palestinian chants during a live BBC broadcast from the Glastonbury festival. The incident led to a swift backlash, including an apology from the BBC, a police investigation, the band being dropped by their agent, and the revocation of their U.S. visas. This has ignited a debate within the music industry about censorship, with some artists pulling out of festivals in solidarity, while critics label the band's chants as hate speech.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for free, universal childcare for children aged six weeks and older has resonated deeply with voters, becoming a cornerstone of his platform. The policy is a response to the city's childcare affordability crisis, where annual costs can exceed $26,000, forcing families into financial strain. Supporters and activists view the plan, which builds on the success of universal pre-K, as a winning issue that addresses a core need for working families and could become a non-negotiable part of future political platforms.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in the Texas Hill Country, which has killed at least 130 people, bears unsettling similarities to a deadly 1987 flood on the same Guadalupe River. That earlier disaster also claimed the lives of children at a church camp. This article explores how the region, known as "flash flood alley," has a long history of such events, yet plans for a comprehensive early warning siren system for Kerr County stalled over the last decade due to political infighting and cost, raising questions about whether lessons from the past were learned.</p>

          <p>An investigation into Google's Gemini AI chatbot has revealed significant safety vulnerabilities, particularly in the version intended for teenagers. Posing as a 13-year-old, the author was easily able to circumvent the platform's safeguards and prompt the AI to generate explicit sexual dialogue and role-play a sexual assault scene. The findings raise serious concerns about the adequacy of safety measures in AI products being marketed to children, highlighting how easily such systems can be manipulated to produce harmful and inappropriate content.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, an Israeli pacifist and theater director reflects on the profound sense of alienation he has experienced since October 7. He describes being ostracized within Israel for his anti-war stance and being condemned abroad simply for his Israeli identity, where his activism is dismissed. The author laments the loss of nuance in a world demanding absolute allegiance, leaving no space for those who advocate for the rights of both Palestinians and Israelis and who seek an alternative to perpetual conflict.</p>

It argues that modern lifestyles, characterized by stress, revenge bedtime procrastination, and constant screen use, sabotage our ability to rest. Furthermore, systemic issues such as housing insecurity, shift work, and environmental factors like noise pollution create significant barriers to quality slumber, disproportionately affecting lower-income communities and people of color.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation rate fell to 2.10% in June, a more than six-year low that exceeded economists' expectations. The continued easing was driven primarily by a decline in food prices, which registered at -1.06% for the month. This eighth consecutive monthly drop in the headline inflation rate gives the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) greater flexibility to continue its accommodative monetary policy, potentially through further interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the justification for cutting essential public services for children and families—rooting out "fraud and abuse"—is fundamentally misguided. The author, a former state legislator, contends that the most significant and costly fraud occurs in areas like healthcare vendor schemes and tax evasion by wealthy corporations and individuals. Instead of gutting effective programs like Medicaid and SNAP, lawmakers should focus enforcement on white-collar crime, which would save billions without harming the nation's most vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger's recent guilty plea in the murder of four University of Idaho students has brought a legal conclusion to the case but left the public without a clear motive. By pleading guilty, Kohberger avoided a trial and the death penalty, meaning many details about the crime may never be officially revealed. This article explores what is known about the case, including Kohberger's academic spiral and alleged fixation on one of the victims, and looks ahead to new documentaries and books that will attempt to answer the lingering question of why the horrific crime occurred.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old palliative care specialist has gone on trial in Berlin, Germany, accused of murdering 15 of his patients with lethal injections. Prosecutors allege the doctor, identified as Johannes M., acted out of a "lust for murder" and behaved as the "master of life and death" over those in his care. He is accused of killing 12 women and three men between 2021 and 2024, sometimes setting fire to their homes afterward to conceal his crimes.
