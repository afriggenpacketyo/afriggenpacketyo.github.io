        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While many casual dining chains like Outback and Logan's Roadhouse are closing locations, the premium steakhouse industry is experiencing steady growth. Executive chefs attribute this success to creating an elevated dining experience that attracts guests with higher disposable incomes who value more than just the food. Successful establishments are balancing high-end offerings with more affordable options and incorporating unique, creative elements into their menus to provide a curated and intentional experience for diners. This strategy helps them thrive by focusing on atmosphere and novelty rather than competing solely on price.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese AI startup Z.ai, formerly Zhipu, has announced a new model, GLM-4.5, which it claims is cheaper to use than rival DeepSeek's offerings. The new model is built on "agentic" AI, which breaks down tasks into sub-tasks for better accuracy, and is open-sourced for developers. The company stated the model requires only eight of Nvidia's H20 chips, designed for the Chinese market under U.S. export controls, highlighting the ongoing innovation despite restrictions. This development continues a trend of Chinese firms releasing powerful and cost-competitive AI models, challenging established players like OpenAI.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan's Opposition Parties Gain Momentum After Failed Recall Vote</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 08:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP), have emerged stronger after a recall vote against 24 KMT lawmakers failed to unseat any of them. The result is viewed as a significant political miscalculation by the ruling party and a setback for President William Lai Ching-te. The failed recall has energized the "Blue-White" opposition alliance, fostering deeper coordination between the KMT and TPP. This newfound momentum is expected to bolster their position ahead of the 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>In the fourth Test against England, new Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill demonstrated remarkable grit and determination, scoring a crucial century to secure a draw and prevent an English series victory. Despite facing immense pressure and questions about his leadership, the 25-year-old's performance was a defining moment, showcasing his ability to lead from the front. His defiance with the bat, which took his series total to 722 runs, and his firm handling of the game's conclusion have been praised as foundational for his captaincy. This display of resilience could be a pivotal moment in his tenure.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining population and the resulting economic strain, China has announced its first-ever national childcare subsidy program. The government will provide an annual payment of 3,600 yuan for every child born on or after January 1, 2025, until they reach the age of three. This policy marks a significant shift towards direct financial support for households to encourage higher birth rates. However, some economists have expressed skepticism, suggesting that the subsidy amount is too small to meaningfully impact household decisions on having more children or to boost consumption in the near term.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting occurred at a fresh food market in Bangkok, Thailand, where a gunman killed five people and injured two others before committing suicide. The victims included four security guards and a market vendor. The incident took place at the Or Tor Kor market, located near the popular Chatuchak Weekend Market. Authorities are investigating the gunman's identity and motive, and are exploring any potential connection to the recent, and now resolved, border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia. This event marks another instance of deadly gun violence in a country with relatively strict gun laws.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Oscar Piastri secured victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, skillfully managing his race after overtaking teammate Lando Norris on the first lap. The key moment came at the start, where Piastri used the slipstream to pass Norris, who had started on pole position. Piastri then adeptly managed his medium-compound tires to hold off a late-race challenge from Norris, who was on more durable hard tires. The race highlighted the fine margins in the intense intra-team battle at McLaren, with small errors and strategic decisions ultimately determining the outcome between the two competitive drivers.</p>

          <p>China is facing increased competition from the United States for control over the Democratic Republic of Congo's vast critical mineral resources, essential for green energy and technology. After years of Chinese dominance, the U.S. is making strategic moves, including a reported bid by a U.S. consortium for a major copper-cobalt mine and a "minerals-for-security" agreement brokered between the DR Congo and Rwanda. These developments signal a new phase in the geopolitical rivalry, as Washington seeks to secure its own supply chains for vital materials.

          <p>An expanding crackdown on undocumented workers by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is causing significant disruptions in the construction industry. According to industry leaders and site supervisors, raids and the fear of them are leading to labor shortages as immigrant workers, who make up a substantial portion of the workforce, stay away from job sites. This is resulting in project delays, cost overruns, and exacerbating existing labor shortages. Construction companies report that even legally present Hispanic workers are fearful, and replacing the labor is difficult due to a lack of trained native-born Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

Jennings also expressed significant concern about the rise of artificial intelligence, fearing it could create a reliance on poor or manipulated information controlled by a select few.

The payments, distributed through a USDA emergency assistance program, are expected to increase as more claims are processed.

The combined lesser-known showers could produce up to 30 meteors per hour under dark skies.
