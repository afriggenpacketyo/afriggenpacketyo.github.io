          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan, resulting in over 800 fatalities and leaving at least 2,500 individuals injured, according to Taliban government officials. The earthquake, which occurred late Sunday evening, caused extensive destruction to numerous villages, particularly in Kunar province, with casualties also reported in neighboring Nangarhar. Rescue operations are currently underway, with medical teams dispatched to the affected areas and international organizations providing emergency assistance. Afghanistan is prone to earthquakes due to its location near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, and this recent event marks one of the deadliest natural disasters in the country's recent history. </p>

          <p>South Korea and Japan are implementing measures to restrict foreign investment in residential properties due to concerns about affordability for local residents. These actions follow similar moves by other countries like Canada, Singapore, and Australia, which have also introduced policies to deter foreign buyers. In South Korea, foreign buyers now require local government approval before purchasing property in Seoul, a city known for speculative demand. These measures reflect a growing trend among Asian economies to address housing affordability issues by targeting sources of speculative demand, particularly from overseas investors. </p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance as investors analyzed China's latest RatingDog manufacturing data, which indicated expansion in August. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong experienced significant gains, led by companies like Alibaba Group, while mainland China's CSI 300 showed more modest increases. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi index faced declines, influenced by losses in semiconductor stocks. Investors are also closely monitoring developments in India-China relations, particularly after leaders from both nations emphasized their partnership during a Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting.

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a 3% increase after the company revealed trial data suggesting that its drug, Wegovy, demonstrates superior performance in reducing heart disease risk compared to competitors. The study indicated that Wegovy users had a significantly greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to those using tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's rival drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro. This news comes as Denmark recently lowered its annual economic growth forecast, partly due to Novo Nordisk's declining U.S. market share and expectations of reduced exports. Despite this, European stock markets showed overall gains, with the Stoxx 600 index trading higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 03:55:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores potential tactical formations Liverpool could employ following the signings of Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak, two elite forwards. Several options are considered, including a squeezed 4-2-3-1 formation, a 3-5-2 partnership reminiscent of Ekitike's time at Frankfurt, and a more fragile 4-2-4 approach. The article also suggests that Ekitike could adapt into a hybrid eight/10 position, similar to how Pep Guardiola uses aggressive midfielders. Ultimately, the author argues that Liverpool will likely rotate their frontline regularly to keep players fresh and adapt to different opponents, meaning there isn't necessarily one fixed starting XI. </p>

The decision to permanently remove peak fares is intended to save passengers money and reduce carbon emissions, with savings of up to 50% on some routes. </p>

          <h2>Immigration Debate: Goalposts Keep Moving</h2>

          <p>The author argues that debates around immigration are never truly resolved, as the goalposts continually shift. Despite measures like Brexit, the issue persists, with politicians exploiting public concerns and media reinforcing a sense of crisis. The article suggests that the question at the heart of immigration crises isn’t "how many is too many," but "how few is few enough," and that no solution will ever be deemed sufficient. The author contends that this constant escalation leads to increasingly stringent enforcement measures and a precarious situation for both immigrants and citizens. </p>

          <p>Staff at luxury jewellery retailer Vashi were allegedly instructed to pose as customers to deceive investors in a £170m diamond scam, according to BBC Panorama. The deception helped Vashi Dominguez secure fresh funds, but the business collapsed in 2023, leaving investors with substantial losses. The promised £157m stock of diamonds was later valued at only £100,000. Despite the scale of the fraud, neither the Metropolitan Police nor the Serious Fraud Office are investigating, and Dominguez has disappeared. (not investment advice)</p>
