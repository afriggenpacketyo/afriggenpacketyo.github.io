          <p>Facing a persistent sales slump, Starbucks is launching a new "Green Apron Service" program to improve customer experience. The initiative focuses on enhancing hospitality through better staff training, friendlier interactions, and new technology to speed up service. This strategy aims to reverse poor sales figures by emphasizing a human touch and making store visits a more consistent and welcoming habit for customers. The company hopes these changes will boost foot traffic and productivity ahead of its upcoming earnings report.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing inflation and high borrowing costs, seniors on fixed incomes may consider a reverse mortgage to access home equity. This article outlines crucial "dos and don'ts," advising homeowners to use the funds for strategic purposes like essential bills rather than as a simple cash supplement. It also highlights the importance of choosing the correct payment structure, comparing the option against other home equity products like HELOCs, and being prepared for a potentially lengthy counseling and application process.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following high-level talks in Stockholm, U.S. and Chinese negotiators have discussed extending a temporary pause on mutual tariffs, which is set to expire soon. U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emphasized that any extension requires final approval from President Trump. If an agreement isn't reached, tariffs are expected to "boomerang" back to their previous high levels. The discussions indicate ongoing dialogue to prevent further trade escalation, though a definitive resolution remains elusive and dependent on the president's decision.</p>

This diplomatic pressure is conditioned on Israel halting West Bank annexation and engaging in a two-state solution peace process. The move follows a similar announcement by France and aims to protect the viability of a two-state solution, which the U.K. foreign minister described as being "in peril." Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned the decision, calling it a "reward for Hamas."</p>

          <p>The largest railroad workers' union in the United States, SMART Transportation Division, plans to formally oppose the proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cited major concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices and what it describes as a "troubling safety record." SMART-TD alleges that the company prioritizes profits over worker safety and engages in harassment of its employees. The union will present its case to the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency that must approve the deal for it to proceed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken steps to ensure interim U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli remains in his role as Los Angeles' top federal prosecutor, bypassing the standard Senate confirmation process. Essayli's initial 120-day appointment was set to expire, but after a judicial panel declined to name a replacement, he will become the acting U.S. attorney. This move allows the controversial Trump ally, who has faced criticism for his leadership and prosecutorial decisions, to stay in power for an additional 210 days without facing Senate scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A former legal counsel in Netflix's labor relations department has filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging she was wrongfully fired in retaliation for reporting misconduct. The plaintiff, Nhu-Y Phan, claims she raised concerns that her superiors discriminated against women of color and that she reported a colleague's sexual harassment allegation. After reporting these issues, she alleges she faced hostility and was ultimately terminated for "unspecified performance issues." The lawsuit seeks damages and accuses Netflix of attempting to force her into secretive arbitration to silence her claims.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that a rift is growing between Donald Trump and the ideological wing of the MAGA movement. While supporters have built an infrastructure like Project 2025 to install loyalists and enact specific policies, Trump has repeatedly ignored this apparatus, following his own unpredictable instincts on issues from immigration to foreign policy. The author suggests that "Trumpism" is not a coherent philosophy like Reaganism, but rather a psychological phenomenon centered on Trump's personality. This dynamic is causing frustration among his most ardent followers, who are discovering that personnel is not always policy.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey reveals a tight three-way race among potential successors to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are tied as the top choices, with economic advisor Kevin Hassett close behind. The survey of economists and fund managers reflects the widespread expectation that President Trump will replace Powell when his term as chair ends. Respondents also believe the president's public pressure on the Fed to cut rates is making such cuts less, not more, likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a changing interest rate environment, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) account, even with a large sum like $10,000, could still be a worthwhile strategy. With the Federal Reserve not meeting in August, savers have a window of stability to lock in currently available rates, which remain relatively high. As future rate cuts are widely anticipated, particularly in September, this period may represent a final opportunity to secure a favorable, fixed return on savings before rates potentially decline further later in the year.

          <p>Intel is implementing significant cost-cutting measures to address its struggling business, confirming plans to reduce its workforce to 75,000 employees by the end of the year. This move involves shedding approximately 25,000 jobs and reducing management layers by half. The decision comes as the company faces intense competition and reports flat revenue with a $2.9 billion net income loss in the second quarter. In addition to the layoffs, Intel will also enforce a four-day-a-week return-to-office mandate starting in September to improve collaboration and efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>
