          <p>Tesla announced second-quarter vehicle deliveries of approximately 384,000, a 14% decrease from the previous year, marking its second straight quarterly drop. Despite missing Wall Street's expectations, the company's stock saw a slight increase. The report highlighted ongoing challenges, including intense competition from Chinese electric vehicle makers and political backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Production figures were slightly higher than deliveries, with the company producing over 410,000 vehicles, primarily its popular Model 3 and Model Y cars.</p>

The investigation concluded that his behavior "fell far short" of the standards expected of service personnel, reportedly related to an affair with a junior colleague. In a statement, Adm Key expressed deep regret for his actions and accepted the decision. He was removed from his duties in May and was originally scheduled to retire this summer.</p>

          <p>A federal jury found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution but acquitted him of more severe charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. The convictions relate to his ex-girlfriends Casandra Ventura and another woman identified as "Jane," with each count carrying a potential 10-year sentence. The verdict followed a seven-week trial featuring graphic testimony about drug-fueled sexual encounters, which the defense argued were consensual.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, establishing tariffs of 20% on goods from Vietnam and 40% on goods transshipped through the country. In exchange, the agreement reportedly grants U.S. products zero-tariff access to Vietnamese markets, with a specific mention of increasing SUV exports. The article clarifies that despite the president's phrasing, these tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, not by Vietnam. This development follows a period of tariff negotiations after the U.S. initially proposed a steep 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports.</p>

A significant driver of this trend is the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts, primarily affecting federal agencies. Other hard-hit sectors include retail, technology, and non-profits, which have also been impacted by economic uncertainty and the administration's tariff policies.

          <p>A spending bill passed by the Senate would cut approximately $1.1 trillion in health-care spending over the next decade, with over $1 trillion coming from Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office. These cuts, driven by new work requirements and restrictions on state provider taxes, could result in 11.8 million people losing their health insurance. The article warns that the loss of federal funding poses a significant threat to rural hospitals, which are disproportionately dependent on Medicaid.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is publicly opposing the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions in her city, calling them a politically motivated "all-out assault." This commentary highlights her shift to a more confrontational stance in response to federal raids and a Justice Department lawsuit challenging L.A.'s sanctuary city protections. Bass asserts she will not be intimidated and defends the city's immigrant communities, arguing that federal agents are misusing resources by targeting non-criminal residents. The article suggests this strong leadership is unifying many Angelenos against what they see as federal overreach.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to stop processing and distributing crucial satellite data used for hurricane forecasting at the end of the month, a move that scientists warn will hinder prediction accuracy.

          <p>Constellation Brands reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, citing weaker beer demand and the impact of tariffs on aluminum. The owner of Modelo and Corona saw its stock fall, as higher duties on canned beer imports and aluminum have weighed on profitability. The company noted that socioeconomic factors and inflation are causing consumers, including its key Hispanic demographic, to cut back on spending. Despite the disappointing quarter, the brewer maintained its financial forecast for the fiscal year, expressing confidence in its long-term performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analyst from Benchmark has reiterated a Buy rating and a $50 price target for quantum computing company IonQ, citing its first-mover advantage and potential benefits from new state-level policy. The recently passed Texas Quantum Initiative, which aims to make the state a hub for the industry, is seen as a major tailwind for the company. IonQ's CEO testified in support of the bill and has committed to working with local partners to build a quantum workforce, positioning the firm to capitalize on future public and private contracts.

          <h2>Iran Suspends Cooperation with UN Nuclear Agency</h2>

          <p>Iran has ordered the suspension of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), limiting inspectors' access until the security of its nuclear facilities is guaranteed. This decision follows recent US and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. While Iran has stated the suspension is not permanent, the move further complicates international monitoring of its nuclear program, which has been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. The IAEA has already been denied access to the damaged facilities, and the decision has drawn condemnation from Israel.</p>
