          <p>The global market for diabetes drugs used for treating obesity is expected to expand in Asia, particularly in China and Japan, as new players like Innovent Biologics vie with giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk for a share of the multibillion-dollar industry. Innovent Biologics' mazdutide drug is expected to receive approval for weight management and type 2 diabetes this year, increasing competition and potentially lowering prices for patients and physicians. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for obesity-control drugs worldwide to US$150 billion by 2035, emphasizing the growing focus on Asia's obesity market due to low penetration and emerging innovation.</p>

The incident occurred as the ship was departing for Iceland, losing power and drifting into the bridge, causing its masts to snap. Senator Schumer questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency may have played a role, while the U.S. Coast Guard stated that the vehicle traffic service was fully functional.

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill advanced in the House after conservatives initially stalled it over concerns about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications, with four conservative holdouts voting present, allowing the bill to move forward. The legislation extends tax cuts from Trump's first term while increasing spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The bill still faces potential obstacles in the Rules Committee and the Senate, with conservatives seeking stricter work requirements for Medicaid and an end to clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>Recent satellite imagery reveals Russia is reinforcing its military infrastructure near the Finnish border, a move perceived by NATO as a potential long-term expansion post-Ukraine war. The buildup includes new tents, warehouses, and renovations to fighter jet shelters, although troop levels remain low for now. Finland, a new NATO member, shares an 830-mile border with Russia, making it a potential hotspot, especially in the Arctic Circle. Finnish defense officials anticipate a significant increase in Russian troop levels within five years, prompting ongoing Arctic war games with American forces to prepare for potential threats.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the Northwest are struggling with low wheat prices and the ongoing trade war, leading to economic uncertainty in rural communities. Despite broad support for President Trump, farmers are concerned about the impact of tariffs on overseas markets built over decades. The rising costs of farming equipment, such as combines and tractors, exacerbate the financial strain on farmers. The loss of trade relationships due to tariffs makes it difficult to regain markets once they've been lost to other countries. The farmers are worried about a looming depression that could change farming forever.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of immigration processes and boost inbound tourism. The new system, modeled after the U.S. ESTA, will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide personal and travel information before arrival. This will enable the Immigration Services Agency to assess travelers' data in advance, potentially denying boarding to those with criminal records or previous illegal stays in Japan. The initiative aims to support Japan's growth strategy, targeting 60 million foreign visitors by 2030.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump’s "one big, beautiful bill" survived a key hurdle in the House of Representatives on Sunday night, putting it one step closer to a chamber-wide vote later this week. It comes after a rebellion by four House conservatives upended plans to advance the bill on Friday morning. The four conservatives voted "present" in an effort to move discussions forward on Sunday night after getting those assurances from House GOP leaders. The bill must adhere to a specific set of rules, however, including only items related to federal spending, tax, and the national debt.</p>

          <p>Experts highlight recent advancements in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, leading to improved survival rates for patients. While former President Biden's diagnosis of Stage 4 prostate cancer is serious, new treatments have transformed the prognosis, extending life expectancy by years. The first line of attack is to cut off the testosterone that feeds prostate cancer. Doctors now have more precise scans to detect cancer earlier and can use drugs that block testosterone, chemotherapy, or radiation. Federal research funding, particularly through Biden’s cancer moonshot effort, has significantly contributed to this progress.</p>
