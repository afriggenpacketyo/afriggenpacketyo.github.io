          <p>Ukrainian officials have blamed Russia for a missile and drone attack on Kyiv that resulted in at least nine deaths and dozens of injuries, including children. The Kyiv City Military Administration reported detecting around 45 drones during the assault, which targeted multiple neighborhoods and caused fires in residential buildings. This attack occurred amidst stalled peace negotiations and criticism from President Trump regarding Ukraine's stance on ceding Crimea. The international community is urged to recognize the severity of the situation as rescue operations continue to uncover victims from under the rubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he will shorten his visit to South Africa and return to Ukraine following a deadly Russian strike on Kyiv. He stated that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha would take over meetings in South Africa to brief leaders on the situation in Ukraine. This decision comes after South Africa recently supported a UN resolution affirming Ukraine's sovereignty, marking a shift from its previous ambiguous stance on Russia's invasion.

          <p>The mother of James Bulger, a murdered toddler, is advocating for a new law to curb the use of AI-generated videos depicting child murder victims. She claims that TikTok has not responded to requests to remove videos showing digital clones of her son discussing his abduction. While platforms claim to remove such content, the mother believes existing laws are insufficient to prevent AI misuse. The government states that such videos are illegal under the Online Safety Act and should be removed by platforms.</p>

Japan has previously dismissed claims of currency devaluation and remains committed to G7 agreements on exchange rates. The US aims to address tariffs, trade barriers, currency manipulation, and government subsidies to reduce its trade deficit. (not investment advice)</p>
