          <p>President Trump has given the green light to Nippon Steel's merger with U.S. Steel, reversing President Biden's previous block due to national security concerns. Trump stated that this partnership would generate at least 70,000 jobs and contribute $14 billion to the U.S. economy, and that U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh. Shares of U.S. Steel experienced a surge following the announcement, closing more than 20% higher. Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30 to celebrate the agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move supported by investor Bill Ackman, which could end 17 years of federal control. These entities guarantee trillions in mortgages, and privatization could benefit investors but risks disrupting the mortgage market. Senator Elizabeth Warren warns it could raise housing prices, while supporters like Ackman argue it could generate significant revenue for taxpayers. The firms were bailed out during the 2008 recession and have been under federal conservatorship since. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the sensitivity of human teeth, which causes pain when exposed to cold or dental procedures, can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues found that the armor of these fish, initially thought to be from the earliest vertebrate Anatolepis, had sensory capabilities similar to teeth. By examining modern-day fish embryos, they found nerves in tooth-like scales, suggesting that this sensitivity evolved from the armor used by ancient fish to sense their surroundings. This research explains why toothaches occur and highlights the evolutionary history of human teeth.</p>

The council claims the police's reduced presence has led to increased disruptions, while Unite maintains that picket lines are lawful and peaceful. The council emphasizes its public health duty and accuses Unite of failing to cooperate, while Unite criticizes the council for prioritizing legal action over fair negotiations.</p>

Despite these concerns, the government has committed â‚¬100 billion of a â‚¬500 billion infrastructure investment program to climate protection, and the new Environment Minister is expected to develop a climate protection program by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's legal battle over his personal security arrangements in the UK has concluded with his appeal being denied. The courts ruled that he misunderstood how the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) operates and how his decision to step back from royal duties affected his security. Harry argued that his birthright made him a target, but the courts did not find that Ravec had acted unlawfully or unfairly. The decision means Harry is unlikely to pursue further legal action, and he has expressed concerns about bringing his family back to the UK without adequate security.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating it will be released later this year. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy affecting 1.5 million families. Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier argues that lifting the cap is the only way to lift children out of poverty, costing around Â£2 billion. Critics have condemned the delay, while charities offer mixed reactions, emphasizing the need for effective measures to protect children from hunger and hardship.</p>

The changes include larger habitats for elephants and an end to practices like long-term tethering of birds of prey.
