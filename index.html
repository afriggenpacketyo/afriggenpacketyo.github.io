          <p>President Trump has indicated a "good chance" of a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The statement follows a visit to Moscow by a U.S. envoy, which Trump described as featuring "very good talks." This potential diplomatic development comes as a U.S. deadline approaches for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face significant new sanctions. The White House has confirmed it is open to the meeting, while also imposing new tariffs on India for purchasing Russian oil.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to levy an additional 25% tariff on India for its continued importation of Russian oil, bringing the total tariff rate to 50%. The move is part of a broader U.S. strategy to pressure countries that financially support Russia's war effort in Ukraine. India's foreign ministry has called the tariff "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," highlighting the potential economic impact on its key export sectors. This action signals a tougher U.S. stance on secondary sanctions ahead of a looming deadline for Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials reported that the suspect used a personal weapon in the attack and that the victims are all in stable condition.

The terminated projects, primarily for COVID-19 and flu vaccines, were from companies including Pfizer and Moderna. Kennedy stated that HHS determined the technology poses "more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses," a move that has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts. Critics argue the decision undermines U.S. pandemic preparedness and ignores the life-saving success of mRNA vaccines.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced plans to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion, following public pressure and tariff threats from President Trump. The commitment is aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and supply chains, including a new smart glass production line in Kentucky. This announcement came as Trump revealed plans for a potential 100% tariff on imported chips and semiconductors, which companies could avoid by manufacturing in the U.S. The move highlights the administration's strategy of using tariffs to encourage domestic production from major tech companies.

          <p>An investigation by the Charity Commission for England and Wales has cleared Prince Harry of bullying allegations related to the African charity Sentebale, which he co-founded. The probe found no evidence of systemic bullying or misconduct by the prince, though it criticized all parties for allowing the internal dispute to become public. A spokesperson for Prince Harry released a statement expressing that the report fell short in addressing the consequences of the current chair's actions. The dispute has led to the resignation of both Prince Harry and his co-founder as patrons of the organization.</p>

          <p>Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) has petitioned state regulators for a nearly $10 billion rate hike over the next four years, a move environmental advocates claim would be the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the increase is necessary to ensure grid reliability and invest in solar and battery storage facilities. However, consumer and environmental groups contend the hike would cause significant financial strain on residents, particularly vulnerable households, and primarily serve to boost shareholder profits. The Florida Public Service Commission will hold hearings before making a final decision on the proposal.</p>

          <p>A report from Kharkiv, Ukraine, reveals that Russia continues to use advanced weaponry containing Western components, indicating that international sanctions have not fully crippled its war machine. Ukrainian prosecutors are cataloging the wreckage of missiles, bombs, and drones, which show Russia's ability to circumvent sanctions to acquire necessary parts. This evidence comes as the U.S. threatens further sanctions if a ceasefire is not reached. While officials on the ground hope increased pressure will be effective, the ongoing attacks demonstrate the significant challenge of cutting off Russia's military supply chain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's attempts to shift public focus away from the Jeffrey Epstein story have largely been counterproductive, only generating more scrutiny. The article outlines three main tactics: ordering supporters to stop discussing it, creating distractions, and providing limited information that often raises more questions. The author suggests that these strategies, such as a lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and a denial that inadvertently drew more attention, have only fanned the flames. The piece concludes that whether or not Trump is hiding anything, his handling of the situation is failing to convince the public.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended $584 million in federal research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing alleged civil rights violations. The freeze targets funding from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and Department of Energy. The administration accused UCLA of creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, an issue also central to a recent lawsuit the university settled. UCLA's chancellor warned that the suspension would be "devastating" and halt life-saving research, while critics argue the cuts do nothing to address antisemitism.</p>

The retailer's CEO called the decision difficult but necessary. While its North American stores are expected to remain open during the process, the filing underscores the immense challenges facing traditional brick-and-mortar retailers in the current economic landscape.</p>

          <p>This article provides homeowners with actionable advice on how to obtain a low interest rate for a home equity loan in the current market. It outlines three key strategies: improving one's attractiveness as a borrower by boosting credit scores and lowering debt, monitoring economic data release dates for potential rate dips, and shopping around with multiple lenders to create competition for one's business. By employing these methods, homeowners can increase their chances of securing a below-average rate, making borrowing more affordable for their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House's decision to prevent Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te from making a transit stop in New York has drawn criticism from Democrats but has been met with unusual silence from Republicans. This muted reaction is a departure from the party's typically vocal support for high-profile engagement with Taiwan. Three prominent Democratic representatives sent a letter expressing "grave concern" that the move sends a dangerous signal to Beijing. Observers suggest the Republican quietude may be linked to sensitive, high-stakes trade negotiations currently underway between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores how Democrats are reconsidering their long-held support for nonpartisan redistricting commissions in response to aggressive Republican gerrymandering efforts. Having championed good-government reforms that tied their own hands in blue states like New York and California, Democrats now face a strategic disadvantage. As Republicans move to redraw maps in states like Texas to secure their House majority, some Democrats are now calling for retaliatory measures. This shift reflects a growing fear that their previous principled stance could lead to permanent one-party control of the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>The commission planning America's 250th-anniversary celebration is reportedly embroiled in a power struggle, as President Trump's allies attempt to reshape the bipartisan body. The conflict escalated after a top appointee asked four Republican-appointed commissioners to resign, a move that backfired and led to calls for the appointee's own removal. The turmoil centers on concerns that the celebration is becoming overly politicized, with Trump-headlined rallies and partisan branding. This internal conflict now threatens to undermine the mission of what was intended to be a unifying national event.</p>

          <p>A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has uncovered evidence of widespread, organized fraud in scientific literature, involving collusion between unethical authors and editors. Researchers identified clusters of problematic papers that were accepted with unusual speed, often handled by the same small group of editors. The findings suggest that "paper mills"—organizations that mass-produce fabricated research—are a growing problem, particularly in fields where publication metrics are tied to career advancement. This trend pollutes the scientific record, erodes trust, and makes legitimate research more difficult.</p>
