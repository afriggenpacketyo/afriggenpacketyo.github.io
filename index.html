          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina. While storm warnings were canceled, the system continues to bring heavy rainfall to North and South Carolina, with forecasts of 2 to 6 inches of rain raising significant concerns about flash flooding. Authorities have reported over 100 flooded roads and a highway collapse in Chatham County, North Carolina, and are conducting rescues of stranded motorists. Residents near the Haw River were warned of dangerous crest levels, though no immediate injuries have been reported from the storm.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 03:05:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this right is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed change, championed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, aims to provide at least one week of leave, acknowledging the emotional grief of the loss. Advocates and MPs have praised the move as a significant step forward, recognizing that pregnancy loss is a bereavement, not an illness.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The distinct taste of American chocolate compared to its European counterparts is largely due to different production priorities and regulations. U.S. brands often use additives like butyric acid for a longer shelf life, resulting in a slightly sour flavor, alongside higher sugar content. In contrast, European Union chocolate standards mandate higher cocoa solid percentages and traditional processes like conching for a finer texture. The article also explores emerging chocolate markets in India and Africa, which have their own unique flavor preferences and production methods influenced by local tastes and climate.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old girl in Buena Park, California, was fatally injured by illegal fireworks on the Fourth of July. According to police, a homeowner set off a commercial-grade firework that malfunctioned, striking a nearby residence where other illegal fireworks were stored, causing a secondary explosion that hit the child. The homeowner has been arrested, and the incident is under investigation. This tragedy is one of several recent deadly or injurious fireworks-related events in California, including fatal explosions in Pacoima and Simi Valley, highlighting a significant increase in fireworks-related casualties compared to the previous year.</p>

Their initial deportation flight in May was diverted to a U.S. military base in Djibouti after a federal judge intervened.

          <p>Firefighters in the eastern German states of Thuringia, Saxony, and Brandenburg have largely brought several major wildfires under control following a weekend of intense effort. The blazes, fueled by a recent heatwave, scorched large areas of forest and natural landscape, with one fire in Thuringia described as the largest in over three decades. Hundreds of emergency personnel were deployed to combat the fires.

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson on three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for deliberately serving a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The lethal lunch, served in July 2023, resulted in the deaths of her former parents-in-law and an aunt-in-law, while an uncle-in-law survived after extensive hospitalization. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally picked the toxic fungi and used them in a Beef Wellington dish, then attempted a cover-up by disposing of a food dehydrator and lying to police. The defense claimed it was a tragic accident, but the jury delivered a guilty verdict after six days of deliberation.</p>

The decision has been condemned by anti-mine campaigners, who warn of the long-term danger to civilians, but Ukrainian officials argue it is a necessary measure for national defense, as Russia is not a party to the treaty and uses such weapons extensively.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is expected to discuss the sensitive issue of the Darwin Port's ownership during his upcoming official visit to China. The port is currently operated by a Chinese-owned company under a 99-year lease, a situation that has generated significant security concerns and political controversy in Australia. Sources indicate that Albanese will use the visit, his second to China, to explain Australia's position on Chinese investment and address the potential for a government-influenced sale of the strategic asset. The discussions are part of a broader effort to maintain positive and stable relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Jason Chapman, a world-renowned British expert on insect migration, has accepted a full-time position at Nanjing Agricultural University, highlighting China's growing prominence in the natural sciences. Chapman stated that China is now the world leader in radar entomology, the use of radar to track flying insects, and that the advanced technology and research opportunities were too good to refuse. His move reflects a broader trend of China investing heavily in scientific research and attracting top international talent. Chapman's work focuses on understanding the long-range movements of insects and their ecological impact.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Financialization of Housing is Fueling a Political and Social Crisis Across Europe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 00:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the increasing control of the European housing market by financial institutions is a primary driver of the continent's housing crisis and a source of profound political disenfranchisement. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have treated housing as a lucrative asset class, buying up properties and driving up rents and prices to maximize profits. This "corporate capture" has been enabled by government policies that privatized housing and liberalized credit, shifting power from residents to investors. The author contends this system deepens inequality and fails to provide affordable homes, creating a political timebomb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States men's national team lost to Mexico 2-1 in the Gold Cup final, ending a promising tournament run on a disappointing note. Despite missing many of its top European-based players, the U.S. team had shown progress under coach Mauricio Pochettino, but the loss raises familiar questions about the team's consistency ahead of hosting the World Cup. Pochettino expressed frustration with a key refereeing decision but noted the tournament was valuable for team building. The defeat marks another loss for the U.S. against a top-ranked opponent, highlighting the challenges that remain in their preparations.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the catastrophic flooding that killed at least 80 people, as the disaster unfolded rapidly overnight while residents were asleep. In Kerr County, the Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in 45 minutes, a near-historic surge. Officials noted that the county lacks a river warning system and that they had no reason to believe the rainfall would lead to such a devastating event. This lack of advance warning is a key factor being examined in the aftermath of the tragedy, which was particularly deadly for campers along the river.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS group of developing nations met in Brazil, issuing a joint statement that condemned "indiscriminate" unilateral tariffs, a clear critique of U.S. trade policy. The summit occurred amid escalating geopolitical tensions, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin notably absent in person. In response, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with what he called "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The exchange highlights the bloc's growing role as a challenger to the Western-led global order and the increasing friction in international economic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy has successfully improved hearing in a clinical trial of children and adults with a specific form of congenital deafness. The treatment involves a single injection into the inner ear that delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Researchers reported that all 10 participants in the small-scale trial showed considerable hearing improvement within months, with one seven-year-old girl regaining almost full hearing. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope for treating other forms of genetic deafness in the future.</p>

          <p>Significant confusion surrounds the implementation of new U.S. tariffs, as President Trump and his commerce secretary provided unclear timelines, sparking market uncertainty. While a 90-day pause on broad tariffs was set to expire July 9, officials suggested the new rates would not take effect until August 1, giving countries a three-week reprieve. President Trump stated letters dictating new tariff rates or deals would be sent starting Monday. The lack of clarity over the effective date for the new duties has contributed to an extended period of uncertainty for importers and has already caused a slip in Asian stock markets.

          <p>Campaigners, charities, and parents in the UK are urging the government not to abolish Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). They argue that these legally binding documents are "precious legal protections" that ensure children receive vital support in mainstream schools. The calls come as the government considers an overhaul of the SEND system, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson not ruling out scrapping the plans. Critics accuse the government of potential U-turns and breaking promises on an issue affecting thousands of vulnerable children.</p>
