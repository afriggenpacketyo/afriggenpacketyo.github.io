          <p>In a significant display of military readiness, two U.S. B-2 stealth bombers have been positioned at a joint base in Alaska prior to the high-stakes summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. These aircraft, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions, are considered a potent symbol of American power. The deployment occurs as the leaders prepare to meet in Anchorage to discuss a potential ceasefire for the ongoing war in Ukraine, marking a critical moment in international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A fact-check by Deutsche Welle has found President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C. to be misleading. While the city did experience a crime spike in 2023, the article notes that violent crime and homicides have seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025. The analysis also points out that comparing the crime rate of a city directly with that of entire states is an inappropriate statistical comparison, providing a more nuanced view of the current situation.</p>

The argument posits that direct government support is needed to revitalize the American chipmaker and reduce the nation's dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers. This move would align with the administration's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group saw their most significant single-day increase since 2008 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. This investment is being interpreted by the market as a major vote of confidence in the health insurer, which has had a difficult year marked by a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The news prompted a more than 14% surge in the company's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California's Geysers geothermal steam field, with the largest registering a magnitude of 4.0. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such earthquake swarms are a common occurrence in this area and are induced by the operations of the geothermal power facility. Officials have reassured the public that this activity is not linked to major fault lines like the San Andreas and does not indicate an increased risk of a large earthquake.</p>
