          <p>A shooting occurred at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, on Sunday morning, leaving one person injured and the suspect dead. According to police, the 31-year-old suspect, wearing a tactical vest and armed with a long gun and handgun, began firing at the church from outside. A parishioner struck the suspect with their vehicle, and at least two staff members, including a security guard, shot at him, resulting in his death. The injured staff member was taken to the hospital with injuries that are not considered life-threatening, and the FBI is assisting with the investigation to determine the motive behind the shooting. Optimism regarding the safety and well-being of the parishioners is relatively low, given the circumstances of the event.</p>

          <p>China has voiced strong criticism of the United States and Israel, calling for a de-escalation of their conflict with Iran and emphasizing the need to protect civilian safety and adhere to international law. China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, stated that the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear facilities violated Iranian sovereignty and undermined the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. While other Security Council members expressed the importance of ending the conflict, divisions emerged along geopolitical lines, with China and Russia defending Iran, and the U.S. and its allies supporting Israel. The Chinese government believes that the international community should prioritize peace and stability in the region.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, world leaders have issued varied reactions, with Iranian officials condemning the attacks and reserving the right to respond, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Trump's decision.

The EU urged all parties to return to negotiations, and Saudi Arabia expressed concern, while the Houthi group denounced the U.S. aggression.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan approaches its first "zero giant panda" moment in over half a century, amidst intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry. With current panda loans expiring, China's decision on whether to send new pandas is anticipated during high-level bilateral talks, potentially during a visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. While pandas have historically symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits, their diplomatic weight may be diminishing. Some experts believe that China may use a new panda loan to mend relations with Tokyo amidst escalating tensions with the United States.</p>

The judge acknowledged that determining whether Abrego Garcia should be released is largely an academic exercise, as ICE will likely detain him.

          <p>The Islamic State is believed to be behind a deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Syria, resulting in at least 22 deaths and 63 injuries. The attack, which occurred at the Mar Elias Church in Dweil'a, involved a perpetrator opening fire on worshipers before detonating himself. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, a Syrian Interior Ministry spokesman suggested ISIS as the likely culprit. The attack has drawn international condemnation, with the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy for Syria denouncing the act and reaffirming support for the Syrian government in its fight against those seeking to destabilize the country.</p>

The LDP secured only 22 seats, falling below its previous record-low, while the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito also won seats.

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert identified five phrases that can hinder cooperation and offers alternative language to foster better communication. The expert suggests replacing phrases like "Because I said so" with explanations that respect a child's feelings and providing choices instead of threats. Encouraging emotional expression, inviting problem-solving, and expressing belief in a child's capabilities are also recommended. By creating a safe and respectful environment, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, the UK government is making it known that while it was informed in advance, it did not participate and was not asked to. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly pressed for "de-escalation," and questions have been raised within the government about the legality of getting involved. The decision by Washington to act alone meant that a significant decision from Starmer was not needed. Depending on Iran's response, these trade-offs could soon return, placing the UK in a difficult position.</p>

The LDP secured only 22 seats, falling below its previous record-low, while the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito also won seats.

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. This transformation was driven by government planning, subsidies, and infrastructure development, allowing China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production. While some Western countries view these practices as unfair, Chinese EV executives insist that all companies have access to the same resources. This has fostered a competitive landscape and a culture of innovation, attracting young consumers with affordable and technologically advanced EVs.</p>

This move comes after a private clinic in Lanarkshire began offering ketamine assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for the routine treatment for depression, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has previously urged caution over the use of ketamine therapy but it is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>
