            <p>Dive teams are still searching for critical pieces of the helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River, killing all six people on board. The NTSB is trying to recover the main rotor, main gear box, and tail rotor, which could provide clues about the cause of the crash. The helicopter did not have flight recorders, making the recovery of physical evidence crucial for the investigation. The preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off, causing the helicopter to shake uncontrollably before crashing.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports. This decision comes after concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases for consumers.

The White House stated that the exemptions aim to provide companies with more time to move production to the United States, though these goods are still subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl.</p>

            <p>LSU head coach Brian Kelly commented on the departure of former Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava, suggesting such situations will become more common in college sports due to the evolving NIL landscape. Kelly believes the Iamaleava case represents a 'correction' in the NIL system, where players negotiate contracts based on their name, image, and likeness. He anticipates better information and comparisons will emerge to guide NIL deals, and more players will make similar decisions. Iamaleava left Tennessee after NIL contract negotiations faltered.</p>

            <p>Luxury malls in Beijing and Shanghai are reducing rents and diversifying their tenant mix due to a decline in Chinese consumer spending on luxury goods.

Parkview Green in Beijing, known for its art collection, is seeking more diverse restaurant operators after high-end brands exited. The shift reflects the challenges facing high-end consumption in China and the need for adjustments in brand structure and tenant mix.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after the Chinese-owned site faced imminent closure. Parliament passed emergency legislation to ensure the plant's two blast furnaces remain operational. The plant is crucial for producing virgin steel used in major construction projects. The government stepped in due to concerns about dwindling supplies needed to keep the furnaces running, and to avoid the UK becoming the only G7 nation without the ability to produce virgin steel, which is viewed as a risk to long-term economic security.</p>

            <p>Sky has announced plans for a UK spin-off of the US TV institution Saturday Night Live, overseen by the original show's creator, Lorne Michaels. The broadcaster promises the same 'live, fast-paced style' as its American counterpart, but the challenges are significant. The US show has a much bigger budget and a different comedy culture, making it difficult to attract the same calibre of guests. Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have often struggled, but the opportunity to develop new talent remains a key draw.</p>

The government hopes to secure private investment but admits there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant. (not investment advice)</p>

The study highlights a more than tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years, potentially exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report's authors point to a significant growth in the use of 'watch antibiotics,' drugs with a high risk of resistance, as well as 'reserve antibiotics,' last-resort treatments, warning that few alternatives will exist if bacteria develop resistance to these drugs.</p>

            <p>Experts warn that President Trump's high tariffs on China and other nations could disrupt global trade and harm both Western and Chinese companies. The tariffs are already leading to supply chain diversification, with companies seeking manufacturing hubs outside of China. While Trump officials argue that China is more vulnerable, others suggest that China has been preparing for a world with less access to the U.S. market. Economists largely agree that a full decoupling between the U.S. and China would be extremely painful for both countries. (not investment advice)</p>
