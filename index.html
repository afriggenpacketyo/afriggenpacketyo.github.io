          <p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, serving an 11-year sentence for fraud, was seen jogging at the Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Texas. This is the same minimum-security facility where Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted associate, was recently transferred. The reason for Maxwell's transfer from Florida remains unclear, though it follows meetings with a deputy attorney general. Maxwell is currently serving a sentence for sex trafficking and is eligible for release in 2037.</p>

          <p>A significant fire has erupted at an oil depot near Sochi, Russia, which authorities attribute to a Ukrainian drone attack, leading to flight suspensions at the nearby airport. Concurrently, Russian missile strikes have damaged homes and civilian infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, injuring at least seven people. Russia's defense ministry reported intercepting 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, while Ukraine's air force stated it downed 61 of 83 drones and missiles launched by Russia. These events follow a particularly deadly week of attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>The viral popularity of Labubu dolls on TikTok has created a lucrative market for counterfeiters, with authorities seizing thousands of dangerous fakes. Trading Standards officers in London discovered a massive cache of counterfeit products, including fake Labubu dolls that pose a serious choking hazard to children as they easily fall apart. The high demand and resale market for genuine dolls, which can be expensive, drive consumers toward cheaper but unsafe alternatives. Authorities warn these fakes are often made with toxic materials and disregard safety standards.</p>

          <p>Four municipal workers in Gyoda, Japan, have died after falling into a manhole while conducting a sewage pipe inspection. The incident occurred when one worker fell in for an unknown reason, and three colleagues subsequently fell in while attempting a rescue. All four men, in their fifties, were pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities detected high concentrations of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas emanating from the manhole, suggesting the workers may have been overcome by the fumes. An investigation into the exact circumstances of the accident is ongoing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new climate study indicates that successful efforts to reduce air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have had an unintended consequence on a global scale. The significant decrease in pollutants, particularly sulphur dioxide, removed aerosols from the atmosphere that had a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight. This reduction in "global dimming" is believed to have unmasked the full impact of greenhouse gases, potentially contributing up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the rate of global surface warming since 2010. The findings highlight the complex interactions within the Earth's climate system.</p>

          <p>A Major League Baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds set a new regular-season attendance record, with over 85,000 tickets sold. The unique event was held at the Bristol Motor Speedway, a famous racetrack in Tennessee, drawing a massive crowd for the historic contest. However, the game was suspended in the first inning due to rain, putting a damper on the record-breaking evening. The event showcased the potential for hosting baseball games in unconventional, large-capacity venues.</p>

          <p>Germany has shifted its policy to directly finance the production of long-range weapons, including combat drones, within Ukraine, marking a new level of military-industrial cooperation. This arrangement allows Ukraine to manufacture its own armaments, such as the An-196 Liutyi attack drone, with German financial backing and potential technology sharing. German arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall and startups like Quantum Systems are expanding their operations in Ukraine, building factories and engaging in joint ventures. This strategy aims to provide Ukraine with a sustainable, cost-effective supply of crucial weapons while also serving as a testing ground for new defense technologies.</p>

Pastors preach in sign language, and the vibrations from drums cue the congregation for prayer and worship. The church also functions as a crucial support network and educational center, teaching sign language to members and their hearing children, fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the US and Israeli attacks on Iran 50 days ago have been a strategic failure, leading to a range of negative consequences. Instead of crippling Iran's nuclear program or destabilizing the regime, the strikes have prompted a harsh domestic crackdown, with a rise in political arrests and executions. The author contends the attacks have also strengthened hardliners, pushed Iran closer to China, and increased the likelihood of Tehran pursuing a nuclear bomb for self-defense. The piece calls for a shift toward diplomacy, including a regional nuclear pact, to de-escalate tensions.</p>

By precisely coordinating the signals from multiple drones, the system can generate a null zone where jamming signals cancel each other out, allowing allied communications to function without disruption. This targeted approach represents an advancement over traditional brute-force jamming, which typically affects all signals within range.

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released after being held in ICE detention for two months. Clouatre was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card interview, due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, advocated for her release, which came after intervention from Senator John Kennedy's office. Now released on bond with an ankle monitor, she faces a lengthy immigration court process, in a case her lawyer calls an example of a "hyper-enforcement environment."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led two criminal probes into Donald Trump. The probe will examine whether Smith violated the Hatch Act, a law that limits the political activities of federal employees. The investigation was initiated following a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions, particularly the timing of the investigations before the 2024 election, were politically motivated to harm Trump. Smith, who resigned in January, had previously maintained his work was not driven by politics.</p>
