        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Accelerating inflation, partly driven by import tariffs, is disproportionately affecting lower-income American households, creating what some executives are calling a "two-tier economy." While overall inflation remains below its peak, rising costs for essentials like groceries and clothing are forcing many to feel a significant financial pinch. The article uses personal accounts from shoppers to illustrate the growing pressure and the need for more careful budgeting. Economists note that lower-income households are more exposed to tariffs as they spend a larger portion of their budget on imported goods.</p>

          <p>A New York State judge has dismissed two criminal charges, including a terrorism charge, against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson in December 2024. The shooting occurred outside a Manhattan hotel during an investor conference for the company. Despite the dismissal of these specific counts, Mangione will still proceed to trial on the charge of second-degree murder. The case has drawn significant attention due to the high-profile nature of the victim and the initial terrorism accusation against the suspect.</p>

          <p>With interest rates declining from their recent highs, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) are facing lower yields for automatic rollovers. Financial experts advise against letting CDs renew by default, as banks will lock in the current, lower rates. Instead, they recommend that account holders use the grace period to compare rates from different institutions or consider alternative options like high-yield savings accounts. This proactive approach can help maximize returns in a changing economic environment where once-common 5% yields have become scarce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran is marking the third anniversary of the death of Jina Mahsa Amini, which previously ignited the nationwide "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement. While the regime brutally suppressed the 2022 protests, many women continue to defy the mandatory hijab law, representing a significant societal shift. Analysts note that worsening economic conditions, exacerbated by recent military conflicts and sanctions, could fuel a new wave of protests. However, the government's intensified repression and the public's focus on survival may also restrain widespread mobilization for now.</p>

          <p>Shares in Oracle experienced a nearly 4% increase following the announcement that the U.S. and China have reached a preliminary framework deal for TikTok during trade talks in Madrid. While a specific buyer has not been officially named, Oracle has been a leading contender to acquire or manage the social media app's U.S. operations. The agreement is a significant development in the ongoing saga over TikTok's future, which has been uncertain due to a U.S. law requiring its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest over national security concerns.

          <p>Shares of Oracle saw a significant increase after the U.S. and China reached a framework agreement concerning the future of TikTok. While full details remain undisclosed, reports suggest Oracle will play a key role, potentially continuing its cloud deal to manage U.S. user data under its "Project Texas" initiative. The deal follows years of uncertainty and a congressional mandate requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns.

The Foreign Office stated that no concerns were raised with their department, shifting focus onto the Cabinet Office and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's role in the decision.

          <p>A framework deal between the U.S. and China to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. reportedly involves a consortium of companies led by Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake. While the precise structure is still being finalized, the agreement will include a mix of new and existing investors. This arrangement aims to address U.S. national security concerns about data privacy and potential influence from the Chinese government via TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. The involvement of established American tech and finance firms is seen as a crucial step toward securing regulatory approval.</p>

The program aims to bring a wider variety of goods to Southeast Asia's rapidly growing internet economy, with global brands like Harman International and Spalding already participating in the new streamlined service.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has commenced its long-anticipated major ground offensive on Gaza City, conducting heavy airstrikes as troops advance into the city's outskirts. This operation, described by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as targeting Hamas's "last major stronghold," has forced thousands more Palestinians to flee south along a single coastal road. The assault has been condemned by the UN human rights chief as "unacceptable," exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis. The offensive comes as a separate UN commission found that Israel was committing acts of genocide in the territory.</p>

          <p>The national average FICO credit score has fallen for the second year in a row, dropping to 715 as more consumers miss payments. This decline is attributed to high interest rates, persistent inflation, and the resumption of federal student loan delinquency reporting, which had been paused during the pandemic. The trend marks a reversal after more than a decade of steady increases in average scores. While some wealthier consumers have benefited from market gains, many Americans are facing increased financial stress, leading to higher credit card balances and more frequent delinquencies.

The analysis debunks several viral claims, such as police removing flags and foreign flags being raised in "every city," showing they are often taken out of context or are outright falsehoods.

          <p>Retail sales in the United States rose by a stronger-than-expected 0.6% in August, marking the second consecutive month of growth. The increase was driven by back-to-school shopping and suggests that consumers continued to spend despite the economic pressures from President Trump's tariffs, which have begun to impact prices and the job market. Spending was solid across various sectors, with online retailers seeing a 2% increase and restaurants experiencing a 0.7% rise.

          <p>Using the recent killing of a refugee on a Charlotte light-rail train as a case study, this article argues that such acts of random violence often stem from preventable systemic failures. The alleged killer had a history of violent offenses, serious mental illness, and was free without bond on an open case, representing multiple missed opportunities for intervention by the criminal justice and mental health systems. The analysis suggests that better policies, such as risk-assessment tools for bail decisions, mandatory sentencing enhancements for repeat offenders, and increased capacity for mental health treatment, could significantly reduce such tragedies.</p>

The primary obstacles holding them back are financial instability, fear of failure, and a lack of business knowledge. Experts advise that these challenges can be overcome with strategic planning, such as starting a business as a side hustle to test its viability and saving a safety net of three to six months of expenses. Building a solid business plan and seeking mentorship are also crucial steps to mitigate risks and increase the chances of success.</p>
