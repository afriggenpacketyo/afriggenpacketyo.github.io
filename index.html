        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A by-election is taking place in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse following the death of Christina McKelvie, an SNP member. The election serves as a significant test of voter sentiment in Scotland since the UK general election, and it gauges Reform UK's potential impact. While billboard advertising suggests a race between the SNP and Reform UK, Labour is also a strong contender. Voters express frustration with politicians, citing rising household bills and healthcare access as key issues. Reform UK is capitalizing on public discontent, focusing on immigration and tax policies, leading to accusations of racism. The outcome will be closely watched for insights into voter behavior ahead of the next Holyrood election, and the result is anticipated to influence the political narrative in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is publicly pressuring Senator Rand Paul to support his "Big, Beautiful Bill," warning that opposition would align Paul with Democrats and risk a U.S. debt default. Paul has voiced concerns that the bill will explode the national debt, despite supporting its tax and spending cuts. The bill narrowly passed the House and faces a tight vote in the Senate, where Republicans can only afford to lose three votes. The legislation includes tax cuts, stricter Medicaid requirements, and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Democrats are criticizing the Medicaid reforms, predicting millions will lose health insurance, while Republicans dismiss these claims as false. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is likely to experience a hotter-than-normal summer, with an increased probability of heatwaves, according to the Met Office's three-month outlook. This prediction follows an unprecedented spring that was the sunniest, as well as one of the driest and warmest, on record. The meteorological summer, spanning from June 1 to August 31, is expected to be twice as likely to have above-average temperatures. This forecast raises concerns about potential heat-related health issues and environmental impacts, urging the public and authorities to prepare for warmer conditions.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Manitoba, Canada, have forced approximately 17,000 residents to evacuate, including over 5,000 from Flin Flon, with a state of emergency declared. The fires, exacerbated by hot, dry weather, are also affecting Saskatchewan and Alberta, potentially displacing up to 10,000 people. Smoke from the wildfires is drifting into the U.S., causing air quality alerts in the Upper Midwest. Resources are stretched thin as officials struggle to contain the blazes, with the U.S. sending firefighters and equipment to assist. Evacuation centers have been opened across Manitoba to accommodate those fleeing the fires, with Indigenous leaders calling for prioritized hotel accommodations for evacuees.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for various sectors, including the NHS, defense, schools, and the criminal justice system. The level of spending on health will determine whether cuts are made to "unprotected" areas outside the NHS, defense, and schools. While funding increased sharply in 2024, it will no longer increase year on year, given the government's commitments. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance on ruling out borrowing more money and not raising taxes again has led to speculation that spending cuts will be made, creating challenging conditions for regaining power at Holyrood.</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated it is in Tehran's best interest to accept the deal, emphasizing President Trump's stance that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear bomb.

Analysts warn that failure to contain the recall challenge could derail the KMTâ€™s leadership transition.

Experts warn that excessive caffeine intake can trigger migraines, and fast food contains high levels of tyramine, which can also cause severe migraines.

          <h2>Trump's Resilience Linked to Willingness to Swerve and Backpedal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience stems from his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This behavior reassures swing voters that any extreme actions are provisional, and that he is generally willing to pull back. Trump's recent moves, such as softening his stance on China tariffs and casting himself as a peacemaker, have helped his poll numbers recover. Voters appreciate seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others, as they expect him to pressure institutions they distrust while accepting counterpressure and retreats.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warns of an "imminent" threat from China to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. Hegseth accuses China of seeking hegemonic power and preparing to use military force to alter Asia's balance of power, while China accuses the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace. The US aims to forge a strong deterrent with allies, but stresses that deterrence is costly and urges Asian nations to upgrade their defenses. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, stating Beijing would leverage them to deepen its "malign influence."</p>

Experts speculate the balloons may be used to help right the ship or protect it from drone surveillance. Kim Jong Un has called the failed launch a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workersâ€™ Party. Analysts suggest the balloons could prevent further flooding or reduce stress on the damaged part of the ship, though the operation carries risks of further damage.</p>

          <p>Patti LuPone issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers criticized her for "inappropriate and unacceptable public comments," specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis. The apology followed an open letter from over 500 Broadway performers, prompted by LuPone's remarks in a New Yorker interview. The controversy began when LuPone made disparaging comments about Lewis's video addressing noise complaints during their shows' runs. LuPone expressed regret for her "flippant and emotional responses" and committed to making amends, with McDonald stating that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.</p>
