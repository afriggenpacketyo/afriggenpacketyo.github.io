          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, issued a stern warning to U.S. President Donald Trump, demanding he cease his "disrespectful" rhetoric towards Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Following a recent 12-day conflict and U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Araghchi stated on social media that respect is a prerequisite for any potential deal. He asserted that Iran would not hesitate to reveal its "Real Capabilities" if what he termed as U.S. and Israeli "delusions" persist. This exchange highlights the severe post-conflict tensions, with both sides trading sharp words despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The recent NATO summit was notably missing the leaders of Japan, South Korea, and Australia, who sent lower-level representatives instead. This marks a departure from the consistent attendance of all four key Indo-Pacific partners since 2022. Analysts suggest these absences reflect growing regional anxieties that ongoing conflicts in the Middle East are diverting U.S. attention and resources away from the Indo-Pacific. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, for instance, canceled his trip after it became clear a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was unlikely, underscoring the shifting priorities.</p>

          <p>Canadian companies are struggling with significant uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Canadian goods, which has hampered their ability to plan for the future. Business owners describe the situation as "killer" for small businesses, citing punitive and unpredictable costs that disrupt operations. The ongoing trade dispute has slowed Canada's economy, with 75% of its exports traditionally going to the U.S. Despite a July 16 deadline for a new trade deal, talks have been fraught, leaving sectors from manufacturing to services in a precarious state as they await stable trade rules.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, the practical future of birthright citizenship in the U.S. remains unclear. The ruling allows the Trump administration to proceed with plans for an executive order aimed at ending the practice, though the order's constitutionality has not yet been decided. While the policy is blocked for the 22 states and various groups that sued, it could potentially take effect in the remaining 28 states within 30 days. This sets the stage for further legal battles and raises complex questions about implementation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 47-53 against a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional approval before taking further military action against Iran. The measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, failed despite growing frustration among Democrats over the lack of information regarding recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Some lawmakers expressed concerns that the administration was misleading the public about the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program. The vote underscores the deep partisan divide on presidential war powers and the ongoing tensions following the recent conflict.</p>

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' critical flood protection system are sinking, with some sections subsiding by nearly two inches per year. This rate is faster than the rise in sea levels, potentially degrading the effectiveness of the $15 billion system built after Hurricane Katrina. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new developments, raising concerns about the city's future flood risk. While the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains the levees are designed to last, the findings serve as a stark warning about maintenance needs.</p>

He stressed that Israel is obligated to facilitate safe aid delivery and called for a political solution.

The meeting was marked by polite but persistent challenges to vaccine safety and efficacy, with members like Robert Malone and Retsef Levi floating alternative hypotheses about vaccine harm.

          <p>In a major 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block presidential policies. The ruling, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, stemmed from challenges to President Trump's order on birthright citizenship but focused on the broader issue of judicial authority. The majority argued that such sweeping orders exceed the power granted to courts by Congress and are a modern invention, not a historical practice. This decision is a significant victory for the Trump administration and fundamentally alters the legal landscape for challenging executive actions in the future.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican-backed budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would create a "labyrinth of manual verification" and lead to massive coverage losses. He stated the cuts would be "devastating," potentially forcing the closure of rural hospitals and driving up insurance premiums for others. The proposal highlights the stark contrast in healthcare policy between the state and the federal administration's agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

While researchers note that further study is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between diet and mental health.

          <p>Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the sisters and creative minds behind the Bafta-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," discuss the inspirations for their second series. The show, which follows two sisters and their mother through financial and romantic struggles, is known for its dark humor and unflinching take on taboo subjects. Sadler, the writer, explains that the series is influenced by their own upbringing in an all-woman household and the "bleak" modern dating scene. The comedy satirizes a deep-seated fear of being single while exploring themes of mental health and family dynamics from a female perspective.</p>

          <p>A century-old building that once served as the Russian Consulate in Hakodate, Hokkaido, is being reborn as a luxury hotel. Built in 1908 and vacant for nearly 30 years, the historic redbrick structure will open in July as the six-suite Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate. The building is the only surviving consulate in Japan from the imperial Russia era and was featured in the popular manga "Golden Kamuy." The restoration project, which preserves original features while adding modern wellness amenities like private saunas, aims to create a new tourist attraction and protect a building beloved by the local community.</p>

          <p>Japanese farmers and chefs are increasingly embracing the prickly pear cactus as a nutrient-rich "superfood," incorporating it into dishes like tempura, quiche, and pizza. Known as "opuntia," the cactus is rich in minerals and fiber, and recent research from Chubu University suggests it may enhance immune function. Farmers in Kasugai, a city known for cactus cultivation, are promoting the plant for its health benefits and resilience, as it requires no pesticides. This trend aligns with a UN recommendation highlighting the cactus as a vital food source for a world facing climate change and food crises.</p>

The lawsuit centers on comments made by anchor Jesse Watters, who claimed Newsom lied about not receiving a phone call from President Donald Trump on a specific day. Newsom's complaint argues that Fox News willfully distorted the facts to curry favor with the president and harbored ill will towards the governor for his progressive values. The damages sought are nearly identical to the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit, signaling a high-stakes legal battle over media accountability.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent explores the resurgent field of phage therapy, a century-old concept that uses bacteria-eating viruses, or phages, to treat infections. As the threat of antibiotic resistance grows into a "silent pandemic," scientists are revisiting this method as a potential alternative. The process involves finding a specific phage that can target and kill a particular harmful bacteria, offering a more precise treatment with fewer side effects than broad-spectrum antibiotics. The article highlights a project where phages are collected from everyday sources to build a library of potential treatments for dangerous superbugs.</p>
