          <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves will miss her borrowing targets by £41.2 billion. To address the shortfall, the economic think tank recommended a sustained increase in taxes, such as reforming the council tax system. Niesr attributes the gap to weaker economic growth and the watering down of planned welfare cuts. The government faces a difficult choice between its spending commitments, its pledge to avoid tax hikes on workers, and its self-imposed fiscal rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's campaign to manage high levels of local government debt has seen its first major success, with Inner Mongolia being removed from a list of 12 high-risk jurisdictions. The autonomous region's exit was revealed in a local budget review, signaling progress in Beijing's efforts to control financial risks. This development comes after the central government directed these regions in September 2023 to restructure their debt. The move is a positive step in stabilizing local finances, which have been strained by declining revenue from land sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cloudburst in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand has triggered severe flash floods, leaving more than 100 people missing in Dharali village. The sudden, extreme downpour caused the Kheerganga river to swell, sending a massive wave of water and debris through the area and submerging buildings. Rescue operations are underway but are hampered by damaged roads, ongoing heavy rain, and poor connectivity. The disaster highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme weather events, with authorities warning of more heavy rainfall in the coming days.</p>

          <p>A Guardian columnist discusses the global impact and subsequent controversy surrounding a published photograph of a severely malnourished 18-month-old boy in Gaza. The article addresses accusations that the media misrepresented the child's condition, which included pre-existing cerebral palsy, as solely a case of famine. The author argues that while the additional medical context is relevant, the image still validly represents the dire humanitarian crisis, as hunger disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, including those with prior health issues. The piece explores the ethical complexities of photojournalism in conflict zones where information is difficult to verify.</p>

Chinese companies, such as the rapidly expanding Cotti Coffee, are leading this initiative by signing deals for large-scale bean procurement and investing in local processing facilities. The move reflects China's broader effort to diversify its sources of key agricultural commodities while supporting economic development in Africa.</p>

          <p>During a game against the Los Angeles Sparks, Indiana Fever player Sophie Cunningham was struck by a projectile sex toy thrown from the stands. The incident was particularly ironic as Cunningham had addressed the growing trend on her podcast earlier the same day, expressing concern that a player could be injured. This marks the third time in recent weeks that such an object has been thrown onto a WNBA court, prompting arrests and a league statement vowing a minimum one-year ban for offenders. Cunningham later made light of the situation on social media, reposting her earlier warning.</p>

Observers suggest the tariff acts as a form of political leverage over Syria's new transitional government.

          <h2>New Poll Suggests Republican Support Among Pro-Trump Latino Voters May Not Carry Over to Midterm Elections</h2>

          <p>A national poll by Equis suggests that a significant portion of Latinos who voted for Donald Trump in 2024 may not vote for Republican congressional candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. The survey found that while 45% of Latino respondents voted for Trump, only 27% said they would vote for a Republican in the midterms, with a quarter being undecided or planning to vote for someone else. This potential drop-off could challenge GOP strategies that rely on continued Latino support. The poll also indicated broad disapproval of Trump's job performance and the state of the economy among Latino voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release anyone early; instead, inmates and staff will be transferred to other locations. The closure raises questions about the future of the property, which originally opened in 1928 as the luxurious Lake Norconian Club hotel, a historic landmark some hope to see restored.</p>

          <p>Japanese rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who has been on the injured list with a shoulder impingement since an underwhelming start to the season, is showing signs of a potential comeback. The 23-year-old has progressed to facing live hitters and is scheduled for a simulated game, after which a minor-league rehab assignment is possible. The Dodgers are encouraged by adjustments he has made to his delivery and his improving fastball velocity, which has reached 96 mph in bullpen sessions. While his role is uncertain, a healthy Sasaki could provide valuable pitching depth for the team's postseason push.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House committee investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, among other high-profile individuals. The House Oversight Committee, led by Republican James Comer, is seeking information as part of its probe into the federal government's handling of the Epstein case. The move comes after the Trump administration decided against releasing more federal files on the matter, sparking bipartisan demands for more transparency. The subpoenas cite past reported connections between Bill Clinton and Epstein as the basis for the summons.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is canceling $500 million in funding for 22 projects developing mRNA vaccines for viruses like COVID-19 and influenza. Kennedy, a known vaccine sceptic, claimed the technology poses more risks than benefits for these viruses and that funding would be shifted to "safer, broader vaccine platforms." The decision has been heavily criticized by health experts, who view it as a dangerous move that turns its back on a technology that proved vital in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and holds promise for future public health emergencies.</p>

          <p>According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered their largest annual drop in coral cover since record-keeping began nearly 40 years ago. The decline is attributed to the most widespread and severe coral bleaching event ever recorded, driven primarily by heat stress from climate change, alongside impacts from cyclones and starfish. AIMS surveyed 124 reefs and warns that the ecosystem may be approaching a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events. The report paints a grim picture for the future of the world's largest living structure.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Justice Department's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her sex trafficking case. In a court filing, her lawyers argued that while Jeffrey Epstein is dead, Maxwell is not, and releasing the "untested, hearsay-laden" transcripts would violate her due process rights while her conviction is still under appeal. This development is part of the ongoing legal and political battle over the release of documents related to the Epstein case, which also involves a congressional investigation and demands for greater transparency from the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its next five-year plan, a debate is emerging among its economists about whether to establish official targets for consumption. Proponents, like Chang Xiuze from a state-affiliated think tank, argue for including the "household consumption rate" as a key metric to monitor and assess, noting China's rate was a low 39.6% in 2023. This push reflects a broader strategic goal to boost domestic demand and rebalance the economy away from its reliance on investment and exports. However, other scholars question the feasibility of using such metrics as operational policy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire, now the largest in California this year, has burned nearly 84,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest and remains largely uncontained. The blaze, located in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, is threatening over 800 structures and has forced evacuations and highway closures. At least three people have been injured, and over 1,900 personnel are battling the flames in steep, often inaccessible terrain. Officials are concerned that a forecast of hotter, drier weather will increase fire behavior in the coming days, further challenging containment efforts.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, announced it has removed 6.8 million accounts in the first half of the year for their involvement in global scams. Many of these accounts were linked to criminal organizations in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to conduct fraudulent activities like fake investment schemes. In response to the growing threat, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features to alert users of suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact. The company is working to proactively detect and shut down these operations before they can defraud users.</p>
