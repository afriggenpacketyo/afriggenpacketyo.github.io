            <p>The ITTF Men’s and Women’s World Cup in Macau drew thousands of Chinese table tennis fans, particularly young women, who spent considerable amounts of money on tickets, travel, merchandise, and food. The event highlighted the growing popularity of stars like Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha and reflects Beijing's efforts to capitalize on sports-related consumer spending. Li Shuran, a 27-year-old healthcare worker from Guangzhou, spent approximately $685 during a one-day trip for her birthday, showcasing the willingness of fans to invest in experiences centered around their favorite athletes.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny after reportedly sharing sensitive information about planned US military strikes on Yemen in a private Signal group chat with family and associates prior to the attacks in March. According to the New York Times, Hegseth shared flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets targeting Houthi rebels, similar to information shared in an official Signal group. This revelation has intensified criticism of Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon, especially after the firings of two senior advisors accused of leaking unauthorized information. Critics question the appropriateness of sharing such details with non-official personnel and using a private phone for government matters.</p>

            <p>Manchester United lost 1-0 to Wolves, highlighting the team's ongoing struggles to score goals, particularly concerning the performance of striker Rasmus Hojlund. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the team's lack of goals, stating that they miss too many chances and need to improve collectively. Despite the loss, Amorim praised the performances of young players Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amass, while Vitor Pereira, Wolves' manager, emphasized the importance of connecting with the fans and instilling confidence in the team. Amorim's situation was made worse by Wolves' league double over them - which sealed their Premier League status - and because their Portuguese manager hire, Vitor Pereira, has had a seismic impact at Molineux in the way United have not experienced.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen alleges that the El Salvadorian government initially attempted to prevent him from visiting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland, before reversing course. Van Hollen believes the government changed its stance due to negative publicity, noting that staged photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia to portray a misleading image of his situation. The senator emphasized the importance of upholding constitutional rights, arguing that the case extends beyond one individual and threatens the rights of all Americans.

            <p>Joe Rogan and comedian Ron White humorously criticized President Donald Trump's leadership style, particularly his handling of the economy. Rogan painted a picture of Trump casually engaging with world leaders while playing golf, questioning the existence of a grand plan behind his actions. Their comments coincided with concerns over Trump's latest round of tariffs, which sparked market instability and recession fears. The remarks align with Trump's now-viral post declaring, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH,” despite financial uncertainty.</p>

Yasukuni Shrine honors wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals, alongside millions of war dead. Ishiba's actions come as Japan prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, with discussions on revisiting the reasons for Japan's involvement in the war.</p>

            <p>The Texas House passed a controversial school choice bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition, after nearly 11 hours of debate. The bill, which passed 85-63, will provide students with $10,000 annually to attend private schools, with additional funds for disabled and home-schooled students. Democrats criticized the bill as "welfare for the rich" and expressed concerns about its impact on public school funding, while Republicans hailed it as a victory for parental choice. The bill now moves to the Texas Senate for consideration.</p>

            <p>Nico Iamaleava, a former Tennessee quarterback, has committed to UCLA after a falling out with Tennessee, reportedly involving NIL demands. The move brings the Long Beach native back to Southern California and provides a significant boost to UCLA's football program. Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee was contentious, with some criticizing his focus on NIL money, and he will now have to quickly adapt to a new offense at UCLA. The arrival of Iamaleava casts doubt on the future of current UCLA quarterback Joey Aguilar.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry concluded that "professional failures" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month, dismissing a unit commander for providing an inaccurate report. The IDF claims its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, with the investigation finding that six of the casualties were Hamas members. The report cited "poor night visibility" and an "operational misunderstanding" as contributing factors, although video footage showed the vehicles were clearly marked as ambulances. The Palestine Red Crescent Society rejected the report, calling it "invalid" and accusing the IDF of shifting responsibility.</p>
