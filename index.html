          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis killed at least seven children of a Palestinian doctor, with two more missing and presumed dead. The doctor's husband is critically injured, and another child is in moderate condition. The Israeli military stated they targeted suspects near their forces but are investigating potential harm to civilians. The New York Times provided the military with the strike's coordinates and time, and the military responded that it had struck a number of suspects. The Gaza Health Ministry reports over 50,000 deaths in Gaza since the start of the conflict, with thousands of children among the casualties.</p>

          <p>Eagles star Saquon Barkley voiced his opposition to efforts to ban the 'tush push' play in the NFL, calling the attempts "soft." He argued that any team can execute the play, but the Eagles' success is due to their strong offensive line and Jalen Hurts' strength. Barkley also dismissed claims that the play is unsafe. The proposed rule change would have prohibited offensive players from pushing teammates lined up behind the center at the snap.</p>

These officials serve short stints in the unit, often away from the front lines, and return to Russia as war veterans. The article describes Kaskad as a "sinecure for officials" and a "V.I.P. unit" that provides a career boost to politically minded recruits.

          <p>President Trump criticized Harvard University over its international students, days after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll them. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." This attack follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order against the administration's revocation, which Harvard argued was a violation of the First Amendment. The university said the move was a critical step to protect the rights of its international students.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Monetization of Presidency Exceeds Past Scandals</h2>

          <p>This article discusses how the Trump administration has monetized the presidency to an unprecedented degree, normalizing activities that would have previously sparked outrage and investigations. Examples include Melania Trump's $28 million film deal, the Trump family collecting $320 million in fees from a new cryptocurrency, and Qatar donating a luxury jet valued at $200 million. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled instruments of accountability, leading to a lack of official review of these activities. The White House defends these actions by stating that Trump is wealthy and abiding by conflict of interest laws, though these laws do not apply to the president. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the renationalisation of South Western Railway (SWR), the government cannot guarantee that train tickets will become cheaper. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that the focus will be on improving services and infrastructure, as the day-to-day running of trains is already heavily subsidized by taxpayers. The renationalised SWR will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure.

          <p>Dr. Timothy Johnson, former ABC News medical editor, criticizes the Trump administration's cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), stating that stopping payments on grants totaling over $1.8 billion for medical research projects will cause terrible damage. He warns that this will destroy the careers of young medical scientists and potentially lead to a "brain drain" to other countries.
