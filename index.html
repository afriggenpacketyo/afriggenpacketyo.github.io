          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff issued an apology for his earlier comments supporting the potential deployment of federal troops to San Francisco. Following backlash from local officials and citizens, Benioff stated he no longer believes the National Guard is necessary for city safety, especially after a successful Dreamforce conference. His initial remarks to The New York Times, where he welcomed troops due to perceived lack of police, had drawn criticism from politicians and led to a prominent investor's resignation from the Salesforce Foundation board. Benioff emphasized the importance of local leadership and partnership for city progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Concerns are growing among bank investors regarding hidden risks, following significant loan write-offs by regional banks like Zions and Western Alliance due to alleged fraud from borrowers. This situation has drawn comparisons to the 2023 banking crisis, focusing attention on loans made to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of potential wider issues, as NDFI lending has rapidly grown since 2008, reaching $1.14 trillion. Analysts note that these loans, often with high loss rates, are challenging to assess, prompting investors to scrutinize bank exposures to this opaque sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News is closing its Pentagon workspace after over 60 years, refusing to sign new press requirements that news organizations deem a threat to First Amendment rights. The Pentagon's new policy mandates formal authorization to publish even unclassified information, aimed at curbing leaks and controlling military narratives. CBS News, along with most major outlets, declined to comply, arguing that direct presence in the building was crucial for building trust and breaking stories. This decision highlights a growing tension between the military and the press over transparency and access.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 16:18:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral 'anti-aging' cooking trend is gaining traction as experts highlight how food preparation methods can significantly impact health and longevity. High-heat cooking, responsible for browning and rich flavors, also produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs), linked to inflammation, tissue stiffness, and various diseases like heart disease and Alzheimer's. Water-based methods such as steaming, boiling, and poaching, or marinating meats in acid, can reduce AGE formation by up to 50%. While social media claims often focus on anti-aging, the realistic benefit is lowering inflammatory burden.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court order that blocked the deployment of National Guard members in Illinois. The Justice Department's request for emergency relief argues that the district court's decision infringes upon the President's Commander-in-Chief authority. This legal challenge follows previous deployments of the National Guard in cities like Portland and Chicago, which sparked protests and lawsuits. The outcome of this Supreme Court appeal will significantly impact the President's ability to federalize and deploy troops within states.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, following renewed accusations related to the Jeffrey Epstein sexual assault scandal. This decision comes after excerpts from Virginia Roberts Giuffre's posthumous memoir detailed her alleged forced sexual encounters with Andrew. He stated that the ongoing allegations distract from the work of the Royal Family and, with the King's agreement, he is stepping further back from public life. Andrew continues to vigorously deny the accusations, which previously led him to step down from royal duties in 2019.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's budget chief, Russell Vought, announced an immediate freeze on over $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects, with potential for cancellation, citing the ongoing government shutdown. These 'lower-priority projects' are primarily located in Democratic-leaning cities like New York, San Francisco, and Boston. Vought framed the shutdown as an 'opportunity' to reduce federal bureaucracy, aligning with the administration's broader strategy to leverage the funding lapse against political opponents. This action follows previous freezes on billions in transportation and climate-related funding, disproportionately affecting Democratic states.</p>

The incident, where Proctor shot Glenn twice in the back during a struggle, sparked outrage and protests. The warrant was issued last year under then-Dist. Atty.

          <p>Former National Security Adviser John Bolton has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of mishandling classified information, allegedly sharing over 1,000 pages of sensitive data with two relatives in 'diary-like entries' over seven years. Prosecutors claim Bolton stored classified documents at his home and transmitted them via personal email and messaging apps. Bolton's lawyer denies wrongdoing, stating the records were unclassified and known to the FBI since 2021. Bolton, a frequent critic of President Trump, alleges these charges are politically motivated attempts to intimidate opponents and control narratives about Trump's conduct.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's aggressive stance on Venezuela, including authorizing CIA covert operations and military strikes against alleged drug smugglers, signals a potential return to increased US intervention in Latin America. Trump's direct confirmation of CIA activity, typically a closely guarded secret, has fueled accusations of regime change attempts from Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Experts note the historical context of US interventions in the region, raising concerns about international law. While some see a chance to oust Maduro, others view Trump's approach as a 'special case' driven by drug and migration issues rather than broad regional interest.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have reached a new record high, topping $4,300 per troy ounce this week, driven by deepening economic uncertainty. The surge is attributed to factors including the ongoing government shutdown, President Trump's trade wars, and prospects of lower interest rates. Investors are seeking gold as a 'safe haven' asset amidst weakened job markets, rising inflation, and geopolitical tensions like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. While gold can diversify portfolios, experts caution about its volatility and question its reliability as an inflation hedge, noting that sellers often profit most during anxious times.

          <p>Faculty at the University of Texas at Austin are concerned about potential cuts to liberal arts departments, particularly ethnic and regional studies, following the quiet appointment of a restructuring committee. These fears are exacerbated by a new state law that dissolved faculty senates, granting university administrators near-absolute control. The university's new provost, William Inboden, has previously criticized humanities and liberal arts in a right-wing magazine, aligning with conservative efforts to reshape higher education in Texas. The lack of transparency and the provost's manifesto have created a climate of uncertainty and distress among faculty.</p>
