        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed strong disapproval following reports that the United States has increased intelligence gathering in Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Frederiksen emphasized that allies should not spy on each other, especially given the growing importance of defense and security cooperation in Northern Europe. Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen echoed this sentiment, calling the alleged espionage unacceptable and disrespectful. The article also mentions Finland's President Alexander Stubb who noted the pressure on Denmark and Greenland feels inappropriate, while Tulsi Gabbard's office accused the Wall Street Journal of aiding deep state actors by leaking classified information. Optimism is diminished by the international tensions and mistrust implied in the article.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering a tax increase for individuals earning $2.5 million or more to help pass his "big, beautiful bill" by Memorial Day, but faces resistance from Republicans who have long opposed raising taxes. The proposed increase, from 37% to 39.6%, aims to appeal to working-class Americans, however, conservatives remain hesitant. Trump acknowledged the political difficulties, referencing George Bush the Elder's "Read my lips" pledge, while also downplaying its impact on the election outcome. The article also notes ongoing debates regarding state and local tax deductions and health assistance, with House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington accusing Democrats of trying to paralyze the Republican conference.</p>

          <p>China and Russia presented a united front against the United States during talks in Moscow, rejecting speculation that President Donald Trump could exploit divisions between the two nations. Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin jointly criticized the "hegemony" and "unilateralism" of Trump's America-centric foreign policy, pledging to defend the post-war multipolar world order. This unified stance comes amid Trump's ongoing global tariff war and withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, actions seen as attacks on multilateral institutions. The two leaders attended commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germanyâ€™s surrender to the Soviet Union, positioning their countries as defenders of history and justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in Vox examines whether Democrats can win over Trump voters by focusing on climate change, arguing that despite liberals' desire to prioritize climate action, voters do not consider it a top issue. The article cites polling data indicating climate change ranks low among voter priorities, even among young voters, who are more concerned about the economy and jobs. It suggests that Democrats risk alienating voters by focusing on niche social causes rather than core material needs like the cost of living and inflation. The article concludes that Democrats should not overestimate the political utility of climate change and should focus on issues that broadly resonate with voters.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article delves into the antitrust trial against Meta, questioning whether social networking is limited to connections with friends and family or encompasses broader social media activities. The Federal Trade Commission argues Meta primarily competes with Snap, while Meta contends it competes with platforms like TikTok and YouTube. The trial examines whether Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp illegally stifled competition. Testimony from executives at Reddit, Pinterest, and LinkedIn has not clarified the definition of social networking. The judge's decision will significantly impact tech market regulation and the acquisition strategies of major tech companies.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed plans to use private companies to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, bypassing traditional UN channels, a move that has raised significant concerns. The UN has stated it will not cooperate with the plan, as it appears to "weaponize" aid and does not align with humanitarian principles. US Ambassador Mike Huckabee stated that the aid would be distributed through centers secured by security contractors to prevent Hamas from stealing it. The article highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza due to the ongoing blockade, with critical shortages of food, fuel, and medical supplies. The UN and other agencies maintain they have robust mechanisms to prevent aid diversion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly weighed the possibility of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while acknowledging the political challenges such a move would entail. Trump said he would "graciously" accept a tax increase on the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers but worried about potential backlash from Democrats. He referenced George H.W. Bush's broken "Read my lips" promise, suggesting Republicans should "probably" not do it, while maintaining he is "OK if they do!!!"

Trump announced this potential change on Truth Social, noting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would discuss the matter with Chinese counterparts in Switzerland. An 80% levy would be a substantial reduction from the current 145% tariff on many Chinese goods but is still far above the 10% baseline in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement.

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by President George H.W. Bush, has died at the age of 85. Souter, known for his steady presence on the court's liberal wing, often frustrated Republicans during his tenure. He stepped down in 2009, creating the first vacancy for President Barack Obama to fill, and was succeeded by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Souter's career on the federal bench began in 1990, and he was described as a "stealth" candidate due to his limited paper trail. Despite expectations, Souter consistently sided with the court's liberal members on key issues.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with a focus on oil, trade, investment deals, and nuclear ambitions. The trip occurs amidst geopolitical tensions, with discussions on the Israel-Gaza war ceasefire and potential new policies on semiconductor exports. The visit draws Wall Street and Silicon Valley executives to Saudi Arabia for an investment forum. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have invested heavily in AI and seek access to advanced U.S. semiconductors. The Trump administration is also engaged in talks with Iran over its nuclear program, a topic of interest for the UAE and Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, offering women an accessible alternative to Pap smears. The new test, developed by Teal Health, involves a vaginal swab for HPV screening, eliminating the need for an in-person appointment.

If the test is positive, patients will be referred for further examination. The approval is expected to improve screening rates and reduce cervical cancer deaths.</p>

He retired in 2009, giving President Barack Obama his first Supreme Court vacancy. Souter's career was marked by a commitment to ordered liberty and a role for the court in making a just society. His legacy includes significant contributions to the court's jurisprudence on issues such as abortion rights and federalism.</p>

The agreement has been met with mixed reactions, with some industries expressing concern about quotas and the lack of clarity on certain provisions.
