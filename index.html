          <p>Iranian state television announced that Iran is suspending its participation in the sixth round of nuclear negotiations with the United States, scheduled to take place in Muscat, Oman, due to ongoing Israeli airstrikes. This decision comes amid reports of explosions near Iran's Fordo nuclear enrichment site and activation of air defense systems in Tehran. The Israeli Defense Forces confirmed conducting airstrikes on Iran's nuclear site in Isfahan, targeting facilities involved in uranium reconversion. U.S. President Donald Trump urged Tehran to reach a nuclear deal, warning of potential consequences if they fail to do so before it's too late. Optimism is low given the escalating tensions and breakdown in diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Christy Walton, a Walmart heiress, has stirred controversy with a New York Times advertisement promoting the "No Kings" protest, scheduled to coincide with the Army's 250th Anniversary celebration. Despite Walmart distancing itself from the ad, stating that Walton doesn't have any decision-making role within the company, some consumers are calling for a boycott. Republican figures have criticized Walton and linked the ad to Walmart, with some mentioning tariffs as a possible motivation. The "No Kings" protest is organized by the far-left group Indivisible and is intended as a counter-protest against President Trump. Given the political polarization and potential for further division, the situation is viewed with moderate pessimism.</p>

          <p>An Air India flight bound for London Gatwick crashed shortly after takeoff in western India, killing all but one of the 242 passengers and crew, as well as several people on the ground. Among the victims were families, professionals, and former officials, with one British national surviving the crash. Indian authorities, assisted by U.S. and British investigators, have begun investigating the cause of the crash, recovering the flight data recorder from the site. The tragedy has raised concerns about aviation safety standards in India, with experts pointing to potential regulatory issues and airport safety violations.

          <p>Emma Raducanu was defeated by Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, despite showing promise on the grass court. Zheng's powerful groundstrokes and serve proved challenging for Raducanu, who struggled with back spasms during the match. Raducanu initially gained a double break in the second set but couldn't maintain her lead as Zheng rallied to win. While the loss is a setback, Raducanu can draw confidence from her performance on the grass and recognize the gap she needs to bridge to compete with top players. There is a moderately optimistic outlook for Raducanu's future performances.</p>

Key areas of discussion include SNAP, SALT deductions, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Senators are aiming to reduce government spending and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path, but disagreements persist on specific provisions. Changes to the SALT cap could face opposition in the House, while debates over border funding and Medicaid cuts continue.

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders, leading to retaliatory drone attacks from Iran. The IDF confirmed the strikes targeted uranium enrichment sites and facilities for producing metallic uranium, while Iran's Supreme Leader vowed a fierce response. The U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, and President Trump urged Iran to make a deal to avoid further escalation. NATO Secretary-General urged de-escalation, but the situation remains tense, with potential for a wider regional conflict involving groups like the Houthis and U.S. assets.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, military installations, and high-ranking military leaders, marking a significant shift in strategy. Several factors contributed to this decision, including Israel's successful campaign against Hezbollah and a diminished fear of diplomatic blowback. President Trump's foreign policy approach also created an environment where Israel had more leeway to act independently. Netanyahu's political situation, including low poll numbers and ongoing legal challenges, may have influenced the timing of the strikes. The strikes, driven by concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions, reflect a shift in Israel's military, diplomatic, and political standing. The potential for escalation and regional instability results in a low optimism score.</p>

The passenger in seat 11A on Air India flight 171 was the only one to walk out of the burning rubble — the lone survivor of the London-bound flight that crashed into a medical college and burst into flames on Thursday, just after it departed from the airport in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, with 242 passengers and crew aboard.

          <p>California Sen. Alex Padilla has continued to defend himself and refute the claims by the Trump administration that he crashed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference before federal officers shoved him outside the room, pushed him onto the floor and handcuffed him. Padilla, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, provided more details about the incident Thursday night during an interview on MSNBC -- where he said he was not a threat and merely raised his voice to ask a question. He said he introduced himself before the officers grabbed him and pushed him out of the room as onlookers filmed the incident.
