          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, 36 years after he and his brother Lyle murdered their parents. The board cited his behavior in prison, including rules violations like drug smuggling and illegal cellphone use, as the primary reason for the denial, stating he continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. During the hearing, Menendez discussed his upbringing and the abuse he claimed to have suffered, while relatives offered statements of support for his release. He will be eligible for another parole hearing in three years.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the transfer of new detainees and further construction at a controversial immigrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling found that the Trump administration and Florida officials violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to conduct necessary environmental reviews. The judge ordered the removal of temporary infrastructure within 60 days, citing the risk of irreparable harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. Environmental groups and a Native American Tribe, who filed the lawsuit, have praised the decision as a significant victory for conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, decreased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% the previous month. While this marks the lowest rate since March, it remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month and was slightly higher than economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slowdown in the dramatic rise of rice prices, which had previously surged. The persistent inflation is placing pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates from their current low levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Facebook group in Italy named "Mia Moglie" (My Wife), where men shared intimate and non-consensual images of women, has been removed by Meta after prompting widespread public outrage. The group had amassed around 32,000 members before its shutdown, with posts often accompanied by sexually explicit and violent comments. The discovery, highlighted by author Carolina Capria, has led to calls for greater accountability and has been described by some as a form of virtual sexual assault. The incident has sparked a broader conversation in Italy about toxic masculinity and online safety.</p>

The fractured ruling suggests that challenges to the legality of the overall policy should be heard in federal district courts, while claims for the actual monetary damages must go through the Court of Federal Claims. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in her dissent, criticized the outcome as "Calvinball jurisprudence," arguing it creates procedural hurdles that could prevent grant recipients from ever recovering their funding.

          <p>Families who lost babies under the care of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust and have been campaigning for an independent inquiry say they feel "ignored and dismissed" after a recent meeting. The group met with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national rapid review into maternity services, but claimed she was unprepared and that no progress was made. The families are insistent that experienced midwife Donna Ockenden, who has led previous high-profile maternity reviews, should lead their specific inquiry. Their frustration highlights ongoing concerns about the effectiveness and independence of the government's approach to investigating maternity care failures.</p>

          <p>French authorities have opened an investigation into the death of Raphaël Graven, a 46-year-old streamer known as Jean Pormanove, who died during a nearly 12-day continuous livestream. Preliminary autopsy results suggest no third-party involvement, but the death has drawn scrutiny due to the context of the stream, which often featured extreme challenges where Graven appeared to be subjected to humiliating and abusive treatment by fellow streamers. The incident has sparked outrage and a broader conversation in France about the responsibilities of streaming platforms and the potential for online content to escalate into dangerous situations.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for the online message board 4chan has stated that the company will not pay fines proposed by Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, for non-compliance with the Online Safety Act. The lawyer argues that as a U.S.-based company, 4chan is protected by the First Amendment and that Ofcom's notices create no legal obligations in the United States. Ofcom's investigation centers on whether 4chan is meeting its requirements to protect UK users from illegal content. This standoff represents a significant international challenge to the extraterritorial reach of the UK's new internet safety legislation.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidelines also aim to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing, following investigations that found many products were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month deadline to voluntarily comply with the new recommendations, after which the government may consider "additional or alternative measures." Health campaigners hope this will lead to healthier products for children.</p>

Despite Walmart raising its full-year sales and earnings forecast, the stock fell, a reaction Simon found unwarranted. He highlighted the company's growing sales, expanding margins, and ability to manage tariffs as signs of robust health. Simon suggested that investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by non-systemic issues like restructuring costs, rather than focusing on the strong underlying business fundamentals.

China and Russia are considered the current leaders in this advanced weapons technology, having invested heavily in their programs for years, while the U.S. and UK are now working to catch up. These weapons pose a significant strategic challenge because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult for current defense systems to detect and intercept.

This action is part of a broader, unprecedented assault on the central bank's independence by President Trump, who has also demanded interest rate cuts.
