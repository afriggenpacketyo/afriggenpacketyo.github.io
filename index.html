          <p>Two leading House Democrats are formally requesting that the Trump administration release all records related to President Trump's administrative claims seeking approximately $230 million from the Justice Department. These claims are for damages concerning the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents. The lawmakers, who are in the House minority and lack subpoena power, have raised constitutional concerns, citing the Domestic Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a president from receiving federal payments beyond their salary. They argue that approving these claims, which would be funded by taxpayers, could involve a conflict of interest for officials who previously served as Trump's defense attorneys.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged dozens of individuals, including current and former NBA figures, in a sweeping investigation into illegal sports betting and organized crime. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups was arrested in connection with an illicit high-stakes poker operation, while Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was implicated in a separate scheme involving placing bets using non-public information, such as faking injuries. The FBI stated the coordinated takedown spanned 11 states and involved sophisticated cheating technologies and ties to several La Cosa Nostra crime families. The charges range from wire fraud and money laundering to extortion, with alleged victim losses totaling millions of dollars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of luxury group Kering saw a significant 8.7% increase after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline for its third quarter, largely driven by a notable improvement at its flagship brand, Gucci. Although Gucci's sales were still down 14% year-over-year, this marked a sharp recovery from the 25% plunge experienced in the previous quarter, signaling that management's turnaround efforts may be taking hold. The positive results have bolstered investor optimism, with analysts suggesting the performance reflects both an improving luxury sector context and the initial success of Kering's strategic actions, such as the recent sale of its beauty unit to focus on core fashion businesses.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who recently ended his own reelection campaign, has confirmed he will endorse former Governor Andrew Cuomo for mayor. The endorsement comes just before the start of early voting and follows a joint appearance by the two at a Knicks game. Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Zohran Mamdani, is currently polling second in a three-way race with Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams has been an outspoken critic of Mamdani, and his support for Cuomo is seen as a significant development in the contentious race to lead the city, potentially consolidating moderate support behind the former governor.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders is defending Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, who is facing significant backlash for a Nazi-resembling tattoo and inflammatory comments made on Reddit. Sanders attributed the controversies to a "dark period" in Platner's life following his military deployments and criticized the media for focusing on the tattoo instead of systemic issues facing the country. Platner, a veteran, has since covered the tattoo and apologized for the online posts, which included racially charged remarks and calling himself a "communist." Despite the disarray, which prompted his political director to resign, Platner maintains a strong lead in a recent poll of likely Democratic primary voters.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty to charges of enabling money laundering. The White House stated the pardon was an exercise of constitutional authority, framing the prosecution by the Biden Administration as part of a "war on cryptocurrency." This controversial move comes after reports that a Trump family crypto venture was aided by a trading platform administered by Binance. Zhao was sentenced to four months in jail in April 2024 as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice for violating the Bank Secrecy Act.</p>

One officer, PC Philip Neilson, was found to have made "highly racist and discriminatory remarks," including calling for a detainee to have a "bullet through his head." The other, PC Martin Borg, was recorded reveling in the use of force on detainees and making discriminatory comments about Muslims. Both officers are the first of ten current or former officers facing accelerated misconduct proceedings as a result of the damning footage, which has further damaged public confidence in the police force.</p>

The test revealed a high concentration of a banned diuretic, which can be used as a masking agent. Because the positive test occurred after her record-setting 2024 Chicago marathon run, she will be allowed to keep her world record.

The groups argue that automatically deleting these communications is a potential violation of the Federal Records Act and Justice Department policy, warranting an investigation.

          <p>In a recent essay, a Stanford graduate argues that the real political energy on college campuses today is found on the right, not the left. The author contends that a campus culture perceived as stifling debate and fearing offense has pushed intellectually curious students toward conservative groups that encourage disagreement and discourse. This trend is not necessarily driven by support for Donald Trump, but rather by a hunger for a robust marketplace of ideas that they feel is absent in progressive spaces. The article suggests this dynamic is leading to a quiet resurgence of conservative thought and activism at elite universities across the country.</p>

Experts are concerned that these intense and frequent oceanic heatwaves may become a permanent feature of the changing climate. While the full impact is still being studied, the phenomenon highlights the far-reaching consequences of global warming on both marine life and terrestrial weather systems.</p>

          <p>During a public inquiry into the Southport mass killing, a teacher from the specialist school attended by the perpetrator, Axel Rudakubana, described having a "visceral sense of dread" that he would use a knife. The teacher, Joanne Hodson, testified that she felt abandoned by other agencies when she pleaded for help with his disturbing behavior, which included telling her he brought a knife to his previous school "to use it." She recounted feeling that her school was "left holding the baby" as police and social services stepped back, despite her significant concerns about the risk he posed. Rudakubana later killed three children and attempted to murder ten others.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government officially shut down, active-duty military personnel are required to continue performing their duties but will not receive their paychecks until the funding lapse is resolved. While a 2019 law ensures all government employees eventually receive back pay, the delay can cause significant financial hardship for service members and their families. Some essential civilian Department of Defense employees will also continue to work without immediate pay, while others will be furloughed.

Funding for these benefits is considered mandatory and is not subject to the annual appropriations process.

With nearly 10% of its workforce expected to be furloughed, services such as benefit verifications, earnings corrections, and replacing Medicare cards will be halted.

          <p>While the U.S. government shutdown is not expected to affect most conventional home loans, it could create delays for borrowers seeking government-backed mortgages. Applicants for loans insured by the FHA and VA may face processing slowdowns due to worker furloughs, and the USDA will halt the issuance of new home loans for rural areas entirely. Additionally, homebuyers in high-risk areas may struggle to secure required flood insurance, as the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program cannot sell new or renewal policies during a shutdown.

          <p>The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed the $38 trillion mark for the first time, a milestone reached amid a government shutdown that is exacerbating the nation's fiscal challenges. Government shutdowns contribute to the debt by disrupting economic activity and incurring costs associated with pausing and restarting federal programs. The debt has been accelerating rapidly, growing from $37 trillion to $38 trillion in just two months. Fiscal policy experts warn that the rising debt leads to higher interest payments, which are projected to reach $14 trillion over the next decade, potentially crowding out other essential public and private spending.

          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining attractive, financial planners suggest that now may be a strategic time for savers to lock in yields before they potentially decline. Experts recommend allocating between 10% to 30% of cash savings into CDs, depending on individual financial goals and emergency fund needs. They emphasize matching the CD term length to specific short- to medium-term goals, such as a down payment or a large purchase. To maintain flexibility and manage reinvestment risk, some also advise using a "CD laddering" strategy, which involves splitting deposits across CDs with varying maturity dates.
