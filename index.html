          <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met with his German counterpart Johann Wadephul in Berlin, where they laid a wreath at the Holocaust Memorial. The meeting occurred amidst growing international pressure regarding Germany's arms deliveries to Israel, particularly concerning the conflict in the Gaza Strip. Wadephul had previously suggested that further arms shipments depended on a government review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law, but later promised more arms deliveries. A rally protesting Israel's actions in Gaza was planned outside the Foreign Ministry during Saar's visit, reflecting the ongoing tensions and humanitarian concerns surrounding the conflict. The article highlights the complexities of Germany's relationship with Israel amid international scrutiny. Optimism regarding the conflict is low.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's travel ban has diminished hopes for sanctuary in the United States for people in countries like Afghanistan and Myanmar. The order imposes restrictions on travel from these nations, making it more difficult for individuals seeking refuge from conflict and instability. This ban adds another layer of hardship for those already facing dire circumstances in their home countries, limiting their options for finding safety and a better future.

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein have experienced a significant drop in U.S. demand following President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' trade loophole. Temu's daily active users in the U.S. fell by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's dropped by 25%, according to data from Sensor Tower. The declines are also reflected in the platforms' Apple App Store rankings, with both seeing a decrease. The user drop-off coincides with reduced advertising spending by Temu and Shein in the U.S. since the tariff announcements, reflecting a shift in consumer behavior and market dynamics.

          <p>Russia is attempting to revive a strategic alliance with China and India to counterbalance the Western-led international order. However, deep-seated distrust between China and India, stemming from border disputes, poses a significant challenge. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized NATO's efforts to draw India into "anti-China" initiatives and reiterated Moscow's desire for India and China to restore a trilateral mechanism. Despite these efforts, the 2020 China-India border dispute has largely frozen bilateral ties, hindering the resumption of the Russia-India-China framework.

While some export license applications have been approved, the rate is insufficient to ensure smooth production, according to CLEPA.

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed military resources, including Stryker combat vehicles, to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat what it calls an "invasion." The military presence includes approximately 100 Strykers, over 8,000 soldiers, spy planes, drones, and Navy ships. The deployment is justified through the "military purpose doctrine," which allows the military to patrol its own bases and arrest trespassers. Critics argue that this militarization bypasses the Posse Comitatus Act, which prevents federal armed forces from participating in law enforcement activities. The administration asserts that the expanded military areas are necessary for national security and to combat illegal immigration, criminal gangs, and drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Boeing 737 Max crash in Indonesia has criticized the deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department as "morally repugnant." The deal, which allows Boeing to avoid prosecution by paying $1.1 billion, includes $444.5 million for families of crash victims and $455 million for compliance improvements. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for the families, believes the deal allows Boeing to "sidestep true criminal accountability" and that the payout is insufficient. The agreement stems from two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people due to faulty flight control systems.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, accusing aides of a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's mental state. Trump claims the public was shielded from discovering who wielded executive power while Biden's signature was used on documents leading to "radical policy shifts." The investigation will focus on the use of an autopen to sign executive actions and whether Biden's aides restricted his media appearances and scripted conversations. Biden, who is battling advanced prostate cancer, has dismissed Trump's claims as "ridiculous and false," asserting that he made all decisions during his presidency.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank has called for China to play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition using Chinese solar panels, creating a model for other countries in the Global South. However, a Chinese energy scholar has questioned whether this vision is too expensive to be true. The Renewables First think tank suggests that China must choose between its coal-fired plants financed in Pakistan and the solar panels it sells to the country, as both cannot thrive in the same market. The report also emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing due to rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. (not investment advice)</p>
