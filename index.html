          <p>Police have arrested a second individual in connection with a series of incidents where sex toys were thrown onto the court during WNBA games. An 18-year-old was taken into custody in Arizona after allegedly throwing an object that struck a spectator during a game between the Phoenix Mercury and Connecticut Sun. This follows a similar arrest a week prior at an Atlanta Dream game. In response, the WNBA has reiterated its zero-tolerance policy, stating that any fan throwing objects onto the court will be ejected and face a minimum one-year ban, in addition to potential criminal prosecution for endangering players, officials, and fans.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially sighted in the UK for the first time, marking a significant ecological event. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, with experts confirming its identity. This discovery is part of the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe over the past two decades, a movement believed to be partially influenced by a warming climate. While its colonization of Northern Europe has occurred much faster than models predicted, its long-term establishment in the UK remains uncertain due to the limited availability of its primary food source.</p>

          <p>Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers are in stable condition after being shot in what authorities are calling an ambush in Susquehanna County. The incident began when a 61-year-old suspect shot and killed a 57-year-old woman outside her home. When troopers Joseph Perechinsky and William Jenkins arrived, they were met with rifle fire from a superior tactical position. Despite being shot, Perechinsky administered life-saving aid to his partner. The suspect, who also shot down a police drone and injured an EMT, was later killed by a Special Emergency Response Team after negotiations failed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a census methodology that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This move revives a contentious issue from his first term, when an attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court. The Constitution mandates a decennial census to count all persons for the purpose of allocating congressional seats, and altering this has massive legal and political implications. Experts note that while the full 2030 census is years away, this directive sets the stage for a prolonged legal and procedural battle over its fundamental design.</p>

Crews have since completed repairs and are now in the process of re-pressurizing and testing the water system for any potential contaminants. Authorities recommend boiling water for at least one minute before consumption to prevent potential illness, and bottled water is being distributed to affected residents at designated locations.</p>

          <p>Records reveal that the man who killed four people in New York City had previously been subjected to two emergency psychiatric evaluations in Las Vegas, yet was still able to legally purchase the firearms used in the attack. Nevada law does not automatically report temporary 72-hour mental health holds to the national background check system, a gap that exists in about half of U.S. states. Experts note that unless such a hold leads to a court-ordered involuntary commitment, it does not trigger a federal firearm prohibition. This case highlights the limitations of current background check systems and inconsistencies in state-level "red flag" laws designed to prevent such tragedies.</p>

          <p>Details have emerged from pre-trial hearings that Erin Patterson, recently convicted of murdering three relatives with poisoned mushrooms, had allegedly made multiple prior attempts to kill her estranged husband. The court heard testimony that Simon Patterson suspected a years-long campaign to poison him with tainted food, which once left him in a coma for weeks. These allegations, which he documented and shared with relatives, were previously suppressed to ensure a fair trial for the murder charges. The specific charges related to the attempts on her husband's life were ultimately dropped by prosecutors just before the main trial began.</p>

These foods, characterized as being high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats while low in fiber, are even more prevalent in the diets of young people, who get nearly 62% of their calories from them. The findings identify common sources like sandwiches, burgers, sweet bakery products, and sugary drinks.

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million, doubling the previous amount. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new reward, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who works with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in the U.S. in 2020, but he has remained in power despite the significant bounty and international pressure. The Justice Department stated it has seized over $700 million in assets linked to Maduro as part of its ongoing efforts against him.</p>

          <p>A wildfire, dubbed the Canyon fire, is spreading rapidly near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties, forcing evacuations in areas around Piru and Castaic. The fire, which started Thursday afternoon, quickly grew to over 1,000 acres within two hours, threatening communities and recreational areas. Evacuation orders have been issued for the Lake Piru Recreation Area and several canyons, including Hasley and Romero Canyons. Authorities have also issued evacuation warnings for surrounding areas and implemented multiple road closures as firefighting crews work to contain the fast-moving blaze.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction that restricts Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from using 'roving patrols' for mass deportations in Southern California. A federal judge had previously found these tactics, where agents apprehend individuals based on factors like race or location, likely violate the 4th Amendment. The administration argues the ban severely hampers its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous judicial district. Civil rights groups contend that lifting the ban would effectively bless indiscriminate, open-season enforcement against Latino communities in the region.</p>

Saint-Cyr acknowledged the profound crisis, prioritizing the restoration of state authority and calling for more international support for Haiti's under-resourced security forces. The appointment is notable as both the head of council and the prime minister now hail from the country's private sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travel firms across the United Kingdom are observing a new trend among British holidaymakers, who are increasingly booking shorter, last-minute trips closer to home. Companies like Booking.com and Sykes Holiday Cottages report a significant rise in spontaneous domestic getaways, with many bookings made just days before travel. This shift is attributed to a combination of cost-of-living pressures, which make shorter UK breaks more affordable, and a desire to take advantage of favorable weather. The trend suggests that many Britons are adapting their holiday plans to be more flexible and budget-conscious without forgoing a vacation entirely.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced plans to build the largest federal migrant detention center in U.S. history at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas. The facility, named Camp East Montana, will initially hold 1,000 migrants in tent-like structures and is slated to expand to a capacity of 5,000. This move is part of the Trump administration's intensified focus on detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants, which has seen the number of detainees nationwide reach record levels. The use of military bases for migrant detention marks a significant expansion of the administration's immigration enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>According to research from brokerage firm CLSA, China's leading semiconductor manufacturers, such as SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, are not expected to be significantly impacted by the Trump administration's proposed 100% tariff on imported chips. The analysis suggests that these companies have successfully diversified their exports to other regions, particularly Southeast Asia, mitigating their direct exposure to the U.S. market. In the first half of 2025, China's chip exports to the U.S. had already declined by 11% year-on-year. The report also speculates that the Chinese firms could potentially benefit from retaliatory measures taken by China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a Republican push to gerrymander congressional districts in Texas, California Democrats are preparing their own aggressive redistricting plan that could significantly reduce the number of GOP representatives from the state. A draft map aims to consolidate Republican voters into fewer districts, potentially cutting the number of California Republican House seats from nine down to four. This sets up a high-stakes political battle with national implications, as both parties seek to maximize their advantages ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The plan specifically threatens the seats of several incumbent Republicans by redrawing their districts to be more favorable to Democrats.</p>

This focus on media ratings comes as Trump's own public approval numbers have fallen, with a recent Gallup poll placing his job approval at 37%, the lowest of his second term. The article contrasts Trump's obsession with TV ratings against polling data that shows low public approval for his performance and significant public desire for the release of all government files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

The demand, made on social media, follows a letter from a Republican senator raising concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese companies, some reportedly linked to the Chinese military. This unusual presidential intervention in corporate leadership has put pressure on Intel, a key recipient of U.S. government funding aimed at rebuilding America's semiconductor industry.
