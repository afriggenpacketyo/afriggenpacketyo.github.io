          <p>While the United States, under President Trump, focuses on the Ukraine conflict and aims for peacemaking, China is steadily increasing its geopolitical influence across Eurasia. This expansion is evident in growing trade between India and China, reaching US$136 billion in 2023, and Russia becoming a major energy supplier to China. These developments suggest a significant strategic realignment in the region, potentially diminishing American influence over time. The article highlights China's quiet but impactful moves in a geostrategically crucial area.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested reverting the Department of Defense to its former name, the Department of War, arguing the current name is "too defensive." He stated the United States needs to be prepared for both defensive and offensive actions, referencing past victories under the old moniker. Trump indicated the change could happen soon, leaving the final decision to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The article explains the department's renaming in 1947 was part of a broader military reorganization post-World War II.</p>

          <p>The Oregon Flat Fire has consumed nearly 22,000 acres, destroying homes and forcing thousands to evacuate, with only 5% containment. Officials warn that shifting winds could exacerbate the situation, despite recent cloud cover and increased humidity temporarily tamping down activity. About 4,000 homes remain under evacuation notice, and 827 structures are at risk. Governor Tina Kotek invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act, deploying additional state resources as firefighters battle spot fires and prepare for returning hot, dry weather.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of homesellers are removing their properties from the market rather than reducing asking prices, signaling frustration with slow sales. Delistings surged by 38% since early 2025 and 48% year-over-year, indicating a potential deadlock in the housing market. Experts attribute this trend to sellers holding out for higher prices, influenced by the pandemic-era boom, and benefiting from favorable existing mortgage rates. Despite increased inventory in some regions, high prices and mortgage rates continue to deter prospective homebuyers, keeping sales stagnant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian Open champion Madison Keys experienced a surprising first-round defeat at the US Open, losing to world number 82 Renata Zarazua. Keys attributed her error-strewn performance, including 89 unforced errors and 14 double faults, to nerves getting the better of her. Despite her coach's encouragement, Keys struggled to separate her desire to win from the overwhelming pressure, leading to erratic play. This marks her second consecutive early exit from a Grand Slam, following a third-round loss at Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>Despite rapid advancements in drone and robot technology, major military powers like China and the United States continue to invest heavily in expensive crewed military systems, such as sixth-generation fighter jets. Analysts suggest that while autonomous weapons offer advantages in reducing casualties and costs, humans will remain central to critical decision-making and combat operations. The article explores the strategic rationale behind this continued investment, emphasizing that drones are redefining roles rather than completely replacing human involvement on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that President Trump is enacting the most significant expansion of federal power since Franklin D. Roosevelt, characterizing his approach as "right-wing socialism." This involves bullying state governments, influencing private institutions, and taking stakes in companies like Intel. The piece highlights a shift from traditional Republican anti-big government stances, with Trump's actions seen as an unprecedented federal intrusion into various sectors, from elections to private enterprise.

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to halt EV incentives, Ford's announcement of a new $30,000 electric pickup truck signals the enduring growth of the EV market. The company is investing $5 billion in a new EV platform, aiming for 2027 deliveries. While US EV sales have slowed, global markets are accelerating, and automakers face pressure to produce cleaner vehicles. Ford's strategy focuses on affordability and domestic manufacturing, suggesting lower prices will drive mass adoption and challenge political opposition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that the Department of Justice will sue California over Governor Gavin Newsom's efforts to create a new, Democratic-leaning congressional map. This announcement follows Trump's praise for Texas Republican legislators' successful push to gerrymander districts in favor of the GOP. Newsom swiftly responded with "BRING IT" on social media. The article highlights the ongoing partisan battle over redistricting, typically a decennial process, now occurring mid-decade in Texas and drawing national criticism.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued executive orders threatening to cut federal aid to cities and counties that have adopted cashless bail policies, arguing they contribute to rising crime. The orders specifically target Washington D.C. and direct the Justice Department to identify other jurisdictions, including Los Angeles County, for potential funding cuts. Trump claims cashless bail allows criminals to re-offend, but studies have not shown a correlation with increased crime. Local officials, including those in LA, have defended their policies as preventing wealth-based detention.</p>

          <p>Netflix's animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" achieved notable box office success with a two-day theatrical sing-along release, estimated between $16 million and $20 million domestically. While smaller than some re-releases, it surpassed others, becoming Netflix's second-most-watched English language film on its platform. Industry analysts, however, believe this theatrical run is a "one-off" marketing event, not a shift in Netflix's core strategy of prioritizing streaming. The company uses such releases to generate publicity and cultural buzz for its subscribers, despite occasional conflicts with theater chains.</p>
