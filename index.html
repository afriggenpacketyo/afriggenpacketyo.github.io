          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that if the U.S. continues to impose restrictions on AI semiconductor exports to China, Huawei will capitalize on its position in the Chinese market. While acknowledging Nvidia's technological lead, Huang warned that Huawei could dominate the Chinese market if U.S. firms are unable to participate. This comes as Beijing focuses on bolstering domestic firms like Huawei to create its own AI chip ecosystem amid U.S. export curbs, however Huawei's CEO Ren Zhengfei said Huawei's single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation. This strategic shift highlights the ongoing tech competition between the U.S. and China. </p>

          <p>The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, reports that the number of forcibly displaced people globally reached 122.1 million by April 2025, a near-decade high, while funding for the agency remains stagnant.

While the number decreased slightly from the end of 2024 due to Syrian returns, the overall figure remains unsustainably high amid reduced aid funding.

The proposed restructure following the sale could result in up to 100 store closures.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a plan that would require colleges to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the student loan debt their students fail to repay. The plan aims to incentivize schools to provide value for the money students spend on education. Colleges with lower tuition, debt loads, and strong student outcomes would receive "PROMISE Grants." However, experts point out flaws in the plan, including the omission of defaulted loans and the reliance on data that is not currently available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., is set to host a large military parade to commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday and Flag Day. The event, estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, will feature thousands of soldiers, aircraft, vehicles, and animals. While the Army has been planning the celebration for over a year, the parade aligns with Trump's long-standing interest in showcasing military strength. The parade has drawn criticism from some lawmakers and citizens who view it as a vanity project and misuse of funds. </p>

While some find positive aspects to Trump's leadership style, such as being a strong leader, overall ratings of the U.S. have declined in many countries.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is employing a new strategy of arresting migrants at immigration courts after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dismisses their cases. This tactic has caught judges and lawyers off guard, with the Executive Office for Immigration Review detailing the approach in a recent email to judges. The strategy is part of the Trump administration's effort to streamline cases and expedite deportations, leading to increased arrests at courthouses. Critics argue that this bypasses the legal system and denies individuals a fair chance in court. </p>

          <p>A provision in the House-passed version of President Trump's budget bill could significantly reduce the retirement income of federal employees, specifically by eliminating a special retirement supplement for those who retire before age 62. This change would affect employees like Michele Santa Maria, who retired early due to concerns about government downsizing and now faces a potential loss of nearly $110,000 over five years. Supporters of the cut argue that the supplement is an unnecessary benefit, while opponents contend that it serves as an important retention tool for the government. The debate underscores the tension between fiscal responsibility and the value of government service. </p>
