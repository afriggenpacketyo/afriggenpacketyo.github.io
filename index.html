          <p>The CEO of luxury retailer Fortnum & Mason has stated that Donald Trump's trade policies, specifically stricter country-of-origin rules and the elimination of a "de minimis" cost exemption, have adversely impacted its tea exports to the United States. These changes have compelled the 318-year-old company to significantly raise delivery fees for American customers, affecting sales that previously accounted for a notable portion of its overseas revenue. The article highlights how such tariffs, originally targeting goods from China and India, have had unintended consequences for British businesses. This situation underscores the complex and far-reaching economic effects of international trade disputes on specific industries and consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a golden age in basketball, with recent Eurobasket and World Championship titles. However, the rise of Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) provisions in US colleges poses a significant challenge to domestic German basketball, as top young talents are increasingly opting to play in the US. The financial incentives offered by American collegiate sports, now akin to professional European leagues, threaten to alter the development structure for European players. German league officials are advocating for compensation for player training, highlighting the need for international agreements to address this evolving landscape and protect local talent pipelines.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann, has been released from a German prison after completing a sentence for an unrelated sexual assault. Brückner, who denies involvement in McCann's case, will be fitted with an ankle tag. German prosecutors maintain he is responsible, citing mobile phone data, but lack sufficient evidence to press charges for her disappearance, which remains one of the world's most high-profile unsolved missing person cases. British police continue to treat it as a missing persons case, with significant funding still allocated to the investigation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) fired more than 1,000 projectiles, including bean bags and tear gas, at protesters during a single day in June, amid demonstrations against immigration crackdowns and National Guard deployment. A state-mandated report revealed the extensive use of force, raising concerns among policy experts about adherence to new state laws restricting such munitions. The article highlights a protester losing a finger and journalists being targeted, leading to a federal restraining order. Critics suggest the high number indicates flawed policing practices, while the LAPD stated officers were justified given the violent conditions.</p>

Government data revealed varied export performance across the region, with Japan's exports contracting less than expected but Singapore's plunging significantly.

          <p>The ambitious vision for large-scale green hydrogen production and import is facing significant setbacks, with major energy companies like E.On and BP retreating from planned investments. The article explains that the high cost of producing green hydrogen, heavily reliant on renewable electricity, remains a key barrier to its competitiveness against cheaper fossil fuel alternatives. Despite its potential for decarbonizing heavy industries and transport, a widening gap exists between initial ambitions and the reality of project realization. Industry leaders acknowledge the need for substantial infrastructure investment and policy certainty to unlock its full potential.</p>

          <p>The proposed deal to eliminate 25% tariffs on UK steel exports to the United States has been indefinitely postponed, despite earlier hints from President Donald Trump about tariff relief. This news has deeply disappointed the UK steel industry, which faces significant financial distress and relies on exports to the US. While the UK still benefits from a lower tariff rate compared to other nations, the inability to secure a zero-tariff agreement leaves producers struggling to compete.

She dismissed claims that her bid was a proxy for other male politicians, asserting her independent and strong-minded political identity.

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK is providing a welcome focus on pageantry for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, following a politically challenging fortnight involving a cabinet reshuffle and a scandal concerning the former US Ambassador.

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has denied Erik and Lyle Menendez's petition for a new trial, ruling that new alleged evidence of sexual abuse by their father was not compelling enough to alter the original murder convictions. The brothers, who maintain they killed their parents in self-defense due to physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, presented a 1988 letter from Erik and a declaration from their father's former bandmate alleging sexual assault. The judge deemed this evidence not "particularly strong" and insufficient to create reasonable doubt or support a self-defense instruction, upholding their life sentences.</p>
