        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 13 people have been killed and dozens injured in Nepal after youth-led demonstrations against a government social media ban resulted in violent clashes with security forces. Protesters gathered near parliament in Kathmandu to oppose the blocking of platforms like Facebook and YouTube, which the government claims is necessary to curb fake news and online fraud. Demonstrators, however, decry the move as authoritarian and a blow to free expression and commerce. Authorities used water cannons, batons, and rubber bullets after protesters breached a restricted area, leading to a curfew being imposed in parts of the capital.</p>

          <p>An analysis from Vox suggests that Donald Trump's presidency is marked by a deliberate effort to rebrand America in his own image, characterized by an ostentatious, 1980s-era aesthetic of wealth and power. This cultural project extends beyond White House decor to a broader political agenda that intertwines his personal brand with the state itself. The article argues this rebranding promotes a specific, less inclusive vision of America by challenging multiculturalism and enforcing traditional gender norms. This aesthetic and cultural shift is seen as informing his policy decisions, from immigration crackdowns to censorship, in an attempt to reshape national identity.</p>

          <p>A French anesthetist, Dr. Frederic Pechier, is on trial for allegedly poisoning 30 patients, 12 of whom died, between 2008 and 2017. Prosecutors accuse the 53-year-old of intentionally triggering cardiac arrests in otherwise healthy patients during surgery so he could demonstrate his resuscitation skills and discredit his colleagues. The alleged victims ranged in age from a four-year-old child to an 89-year-old adult. Pechier, who faces life imprisonment if convicted, has denied all charges, claiming he is not responsible for the victims' suffering and that he has strong arguments to prove his innocence.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. corporations like Coca-Cola and McDonald's are launching marketing campaigns in Germany that emphasize their products are "Made in Germany," a strategy to counter declining American favorability. As consumer sentiment shifts, these brands are highlighting their use of local supply chains and their deep-rooted presence in German society to distance themselves from U.S. politics. This trend is not limited to Germany, as other companies like Tesla and Heinz face similar challenges in international markets. The campaigns reflect a broader effort by American firms to tailor their brand image to local audiences in a complex geopolitical climate.</p>

          <p>The French government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, is on the brink of collapse as it faces a critical no-confidence vote over deeply unpopular austerity measures. Bayrou has proposed €44 billion in spending cuts to tackle France's soaring debt and a deficit that far exceeds EU targets. The political instability stems from a fractured parliament where neither President Emmanuel Macron's centrist bloc nor the opposition holds a clear majority, leading to legislative gridlock. With both far-right and far-left factions determined to topple the government, Macron's ability to govern domestically for the remainder of his term is severely threatened.</p>

          <p>A new study from Northwestern Medicine has discovered the presence of Human Pegivirus (HPgV) in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, but not in a control group without the condition. This finding challenges the long-held belief that HPgV is a harmless virus that does not infect the brain. Researchers found the virus in half of the Parkinson's brains they examined and noted that its presence was associated with more advanced brain changes related to the disease. The discovery suggests a potential environmental factor that may interact with genetic predispositions to influence the development of Parkinson's, opening new avenues for research.</p>

          <p>A surfer was killed in a shark attack off a popular beach in northern Sydney, with biologists identifying a great white shark up to 12 feet long as the likely culprit. The victim, identified as 57-year-old Mercury Psillakis, reportedly spotted the shark first and warned other surfers before he was fatally mauled, losing several limbs. This marks Sydney's first fatal shark attack since 2022, prompting the closure of nearby beaches and the deployment of additional baited drumlines to monitor shark activity. The incident has shaken the local community and serves as a stark reminder of the dangers present in Australian waters.</p>

          <p>Japanese singer-songwriter Fujii Kaze, who recently sold out the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, credits the city with revitalizing his creativity after a period of burnout. The 28-year-old artist, who rose to global fame with his viral TikTok hit "Shinunoga E-wa," has released his new album "Prema," his first since signing with Republic Records.

          <p>A recent whistleblower trial has brought to light serious allegations of mismanagement, overspending, and inadequate cleanup following major California wildfires. A former state debris operations manager claimed that contractors overcharged for services and left toxic contamination behind, and that his attempts to flag these issues led to his dismissal. The trial revealed an audit that found poor oversight and questionable spending by CalRecycle, the agency managing the cleanup contracts. While the jury did not rule in the whistleblower's favor, the case has raised significant questions about the state's handling of billion-dollar disaster recovery operations.</p>

          <p>A legislative movement is growing across the United States to address menopause as a public policy priority, with a new California bill, AB 432, at the forefront. The bill aims to improve affordability and quality of care by requiring health insurance to cover menopause treatments and incentivizing specialized medical training for clinicians. Advocates, including actor Halle Berry, are urging Governor Gavin Newsom to sign the legislation, positioning California to become a national leader on the issue. The movement frames accessible menopause care not just as a health issue, but as a crucial component of supporting women's well-being and participation in the economy and society.</p>

          <p>California is currently navigating a summer wave of COVID-19, with wastewater data showing very high levels of the virus in the state and test positivity rates on the rise. While this surge is milder than those in previous years, with hospital admissions remaining relatively low, it has raised concerns among health officials about the upcoming fall and winter seasons. Compounding the issue is growing confusion and difficulty in accessing the latest COVID-19 vaccines, particularly for individuals under 65. In response, California has joined other West Coast states to form an alliance aimed at providing independent, science-based immunization guidance.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "Riefenstahl" by Andres Veiel, delves into the archives of Adolf Hitler's personal filmmaker to provide a definitive examination of her life and work. The film explores her role in creating iconic Nazi propaganda like "Triumph of the Will" and her lifelong denial of complicity in the regime's atrocities. Using previously unseen materials, Veiel investigates claims that she witnessed war crimes and used concentration camp prisoners as extras, revealing a figure who maintained a stance of artistic purity over political responsibility. The documentary portrays her as a symbol of a larger German narrative grappling with its past.</p>

          <p>A woman is on trial in New Zealand, accused of murdering her two young children in 2018 and concealing their bodies in suitcases that went undiscovered for four years. The defendant, Hakyung Lee, was extradited from South Korea to face charges for the deaths of her 6-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. The children's remains were found in 2022 by people who bought the contents of an abandoned storage unit in an online auction. Lee, who is representing herself, has pleaded not guilty, and the court has been told that her sanity at the time of the alleged killings will be a key issue during the trial.</p>

          <p>A New Zealand man who had been on the run with his three children for nearly four years has been shot and killed by police. Tom Phillips, an experienced bushman, disappeared with his children in late 2021 after losing a custody battle, sparking a nationwide manhunt.

When officers approached, Phillips opened fire, seriously injuring one officer before being fatally shot in the return fire. The three children were later found safe at a remote campsite, bringing a tragic end to an enduring national mystery.</p>

          <p>The board of Tottenham Hotspur has announced that the Premier League club is not for sale, confirming it has "unequivocally rejected" two preliminary expressions of interest. The statement came after the recent departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, which had fueled speculation about a potential takeover. The club's majority owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, affirmed it has no intention of selling its stake. One of the approaches came from PCP International Finance, which has since confirmed it will not make an offer, effectively preventing another bid for six months under UK takeover rules.</p>
