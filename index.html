          <p>Bank of Japan's Ueda indicated that the timing of the next rate hike remains uncertain due to an unclear economic outlook. This statement suggests a cautious approach by the BOJ, closely monitoring economic indicators before making any further adjustments to its monetary policy. The fluid situation reflects the challenges in balancing economic growth and inflation targets amid global economic uncertainties, particularly the impact of U.S. tariffs and trade policies on the Japanese economy. The BOJ is keen on assessing how these external factors will influence domestic corporate profits and overall economic activity. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), a move seen as an effort to improve relations with the EU amid trade tensions with the U.S. under President Trump. The sanctions, imposed in 2021, targeted MEPs accused of spreading lies about human rights in Xinjiang. While the lifting of sanctions may facilitate future talks, the EU maintains its concerns about human rights issues in China and has no plans to lift its own sanctions. Experts believe this is primarily a diplomatic overture to pave the way for trade discussions, though significant constraints remain due to China's ties with Russia. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk contend that the U.S. military lacks the necessary personnel and resources to fight a major war, despite possessing advanced equipment. They argue that the focus on high-tech weapons has come at the expense of quantity and durability, leaving the military ill-prepared for prolonged conflicts. The authors point to the war in Ukraine, battles in the Middle East, and operations against the Houthis as examples highlighting the demands of modern warfare.
