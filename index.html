          <p>A new climate visa program offered by Australia has seen applications from over one-third of Tuvalu's population. The Pacific Engagement visa, part of a broader union treaty, grants permanent residency and access to Australian social services. This overwhelming response highlights the severe threat of climate-related displacement facing the low-lying island nation. Scientists predict much of Tuvalu could be below high tide levels by 2050, underscoring the urgency for such migration pathways.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's vehicle production experienced a significant downturn in May, falling by 32.8% to its lowest level since 1949, excluding the pandemic lockdown period. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributes the slump to model changeovers and the severe impact of U.S. tariffs, which caused a 55.4% drop in shipments to that market. Despite the grim figures, some optimism exists due to recent trade deals and a more positive relationship with the EU.

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a steep 9.1% year-on-year decline in May, the most significant drop in seven months, signaling that government stimulus efforts may be insufficient. The National Bureau of Statistics cited weak domestic demand and falling industrial product prices as primary causes for the downturn. Despite a recovery in retail sales, businesses are struggling with profitability due to intense price wars and lower-than-normal price levels. Economists suggest Beijing may delay further stimulus, awaiting signs of deeper economic stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after a landslide election victory, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is facing significant crises, marking a stormy end to its first year. The article details the initial high hopes, the challenges of an inexperienced cabinet, and the difficult inheritance of economic woes and global conflicts. Key issues discussed include an over-cautious election campaign, the controversial hiring and firing of chief of staff Sue Gray, and early policy missteps. It questions whether the prime minister can overcome these early struggles and turn his government's fortunes around.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has executed a significant U-turn on its proposed welfare reforms following immense pressure from its own MPs. This reversal marks the third major policy change and is seen as a considerable political embarrassment for a government with a large majority less than a year in office. The capitulation was forced by a well-organized backbench rebellion that threatened a parliamentary defeat. This event raises serious questions about the prime minister's authority and the government's ability to manage the country's finances.</p>

          <p>A nuclear energy agreement signed between Germany and Brazil in 1975 is marking its 50th anniversary amidst renewed debate. The treaty, which aimed to build eight nuclear plants in Brazil, has been criticized for its high costs and limited success, with only one plant, Angra-2, becoming operational after decades of construction. Critics point to safety concerns and geopolitical issues, such as Brazil's uranium deals with Russia, as reasons to terminate the pact. However, with a global resurgence in nuclear power, some in Germany see the agreement as a relevant example of technological partnership.</p>

While the judge condemned the "dangerous and shocking" nature of the attack, the suspended sentence reflects the mitigating circumstances of her mental health condition.

          <p>At a global forum in Bangkok, the United Nations agency Unesco is advocating for the adoption of its ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence. Unesco's Director-General called for international collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society to ensure AI is developed for the common good. The event drew over 1,000 participants, primarily from the Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America, aiming to build a consensus on AI governance. This push for ethical standards comes amid deepening technological rivalry between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was dubbed the "Twitter killer." Shiraishi was convicted of murdering, dismembering, and storing the bodies of nine people, aged 15 to 26, in his apartment in 2017. He lured his victims, who had expressed suicidal thoughts online, by offering to help them die. The execution has reignited debate over Japan's use of capital punishment, a practice that retains strong public support despite criticism from international human rights groups.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, economists have called for China to undertake structural reforms to transition into a consumption-driven economy. Jin Keyu, a professor at HKUST, argued that China cannot become a wealthy nation without becoming a major consumer country. She warned that China's current production-focused model could lead to trade friction with the rest of the world. The panel suggested that focusing on the services sector and smaller cities could unlock opportunities for greater internal consumption. (not investment advice)</p>
