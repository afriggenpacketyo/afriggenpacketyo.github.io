        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is reconsidering its stance on a youth visa deal with the EU to improve relations post-Brexit, with Labour MPs advocating for a reciprocal scheme for those under 30 to facilitate study and work abroad. This comes as European leaders have emphasized the importance of such an agreement to boost cooperation between the UK and EU. Germany's ambassador to the UK expressed hope for progress on this issue as part of a broader package of negotiations, addressing obstacles EU citizens have faced since Brexit. The UK currently has youth visa programs with 12 non-EU countries, which could serve as a model for an EU agreement.</p>

          <p>A senior Palestinian official has indicated that Hamas is considering handing over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity, potentially the Palestinian Authority or a new body, as part of ceasefire negotiations with Israel. This proposal is part of a broader ceasefire plan that includes a long-term truce, the release of hostages and prisoners, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected any role for the PA in Gaza's future, and experts remain skeptical about Hamas voluntarily disarming. The ongoing conflict has caused widespread destruction and casualties in Gaza, leading to increasing pressure on Hamas from both inside and outside the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that the U.S. and China are engaged in tariff negotiations, contradicting China's statement that such talks are "fake news." Trump mentioned a meeting that occurred on Thursday morning but declined to disclose the participants. This exchange follows a recent escalation in trade tensions, with Trump imposing higher tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from China.

          <p>Several consumer companies, ranging from Chipotle to Delta, are expressing concerns about the potential impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on their earnings and consumer spending. Companies are slashing forecasts, projecting that tariffs will weigh on their profits and put more pressure on an already shaky consumer. The tariffs are increasing prices on key commodities, impacting earnings, while the uncertainty bred by the trade war is also damaging to businesses' bottom lines. While a pause on higher rates is in effect until early July, the situation remains fluid, with some industries pushing for exemptions.</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to discuss a potential US-UK trade agreement with the US Treasury secretary, aiming to persuade Trump to reduce tariffs on UK car imports. Bailey expressed hope for a UK-US trade deal but emphasized that the UK would still be affected by a slowdown in global growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to reinstate its ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. This action follows multiple court rulings against the ban. The administration argues that the sexual identity of transgender troops harms military readiness. The executive order states that a man's assertion that he is a woman is inconsistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member. The ban was initially confirmed by the supreme court but scrapped by Joe Biden after he took office in 2021.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked a key section of President Trump's executive order that seeks sweeping changes to voting and elections. The order instructed the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to modify the national mail voter registration form, requiring applicants to provide proof of U.S. citizenship. The judge asserted that the Constitution entrusts Congress and the states, not the President, with the authority to regulate federal elections. The decision also pauses a provision requiring government agencies to assess citizenship before distributing voter registration forms to enrollees of public assistance programs.</p>
