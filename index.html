        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single, a departure from the fairytale endings of the original "Sex and the City." This article argues that this conclusion is more authentic to the show's core theme: the enduring power of female friendships over romantic love. While the spin-off series has been criticized for its writing, it ultimately provides Carrie with an ending that acknowledges her self-sufficiency and the primary importance of her friends. This outcome is presented as a more mature and fitting resolution for the character after decades of narrative evolution.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite trade pressures from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in net exports, which rebounded from a contraction in the previous quarter. This economic resilience comes even as the country faced 25% U.S. tariffs on its crucial automobile sector during the period. While the Bank of Japan has upgraded its growth forecast, it remains cautious about the potential impact of global trade policies on future economic performance. (not investment advice)</p>

The man, an unemployed car technician, described his actions as a "cry for help" related to personal and legal issues. He was arrested for disturbing the peace and interfering with a peace officer after sounding the horn again shortly after promising police he would stop.</p>

His detention has drawn concern from the community and the Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent, who highlighted the poor conditions he is allegedly facing in custody. The incident adds to the growing fear among immigrant families in Los Angeles regarding immigration enforcement actions near schools.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), a breakthrough that could significantly enhance naval capabilities. The runway-independent aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of standard warships, even in rough seas, before transitioning to fast, long-range flight. This technology could effectively turn any vessel in the Chinese navy, such as destroyers or frigates, into a small aircraft carrier. The project team claims the new drone is far superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in operation.</p>

The announcement rally was notably attended by federal agents, a presence Newsom decried as an intimidation tactic ordered by the Trump administration.

Humm noted that the all-vegan concept was exclusionary and led to a decline in wine sales and private event bookings.

While Netanyahu maintains a hardline stance on achieving "total victory," a growing movement within the country is calling for an end to the conflict to secure the return of the remaining hostages. Opinion polls show a stark divide, with most Jewish Israelis not troubled by Palestinian suffering, while others hold silent vigils for killed Palestinian children.

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats to praise their decision to leave the state, an action that denied Republicans the quorum needed to pass a partisan redistricting plan. Obama commended their "courage" and framed their efforts as a crucial part of a larger, long-term struggle to protect democracy from gerrymandering. His involvement, along with former Attorney General Eric Holder, signals high-level support within the Democratic party for the Texas legislators' actions. The standoff is a key front in the national battle over voting maps ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is framed by divergent priorities for ending the war in Ukraine. For Putin, the meeting offers a form of diplomatic rehabilitation on the world stage and a chance to solidify territorial gains. For Trump, who has often expressed a desire to be a peacemaker, the goal is to broker a deal, though his approach has been inconsistent. Analysts note that Putin seeks to deal directly with the U.S., sidelining European and Ukrainian leaders, while Trump aims for a significant foreign policy achievement.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams will make history at this year's U.S. Open as the oldest competitor in the singles tournament since 1981. At 45 years old, Williams received a wild card invitation to compete in her 25th U.S. Open singles championship. This milestone follows her recent victory at the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004. Her longevity highlights a unique aspect of professional tennis, where many athletes have achieved significant success well into their 30s and 40s, including her sister Serena Williams.</p>

          <p>Three audition records made by the late Dame Vera Lynn 90 years ago are being released for the first time. The rare silver aluminium discs were discovered by her daughter after she donated the singer's record collection to the British Library's Sound Archive. Recorded in 1935, these tracks capture the voice of the "Forces' Sweetheart" at the very beginning of her illustrious career. The first single, "What A Difference A Day Makes," will be released to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, with more unheard tracks to follow on a new album.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is set to increase its number of data centres by nearly 20%, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely driven by the growth of artificial intelligence. While the government views this expansion as crucial for the economy, concerns are mounting over the immense energy and water these powerful computer warehouses will consume. Experts warn that the increased demand on the power grid could lead to higher energy bills for consumers. Environmental questions are also being raised, particularly regarding the strain on water supplies in regions like London and the south-east.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed for international audiences by digitally altering actors' lip movements to match the new language. Developed by the company Flawless, the technology aims to create a more seamless viewing experience than traditional dubbing, potentially opening up markets like the U.S. to more global cinema. The studio XYZ Films successfully used the tool for the U.S. theatrical release of a Swedish sci-fi film. The technology is seen as a way to help creative works cross cultural barriers more effectively.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, providing benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, questions about its long-term financial stability are mounting. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if Congress does not act. This funding gap is a major source of anxiety for Americans, with confidence in the program's future declining. Potential fixes include raising the cap on income subject to payroll taxes or increasing the full retirement age. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing an existential threat from affordable and technologically advanced Chinese electric vehicles, Ford is overhauling its manufacturing process to produce cheaper EVs. The company announced plans for a new $30,000 electric pickup truck to be built at a retooled Kentucky factory starting in 2027. This new approach, designed by former Tesla and Apple engineers, involves a simplified "assembly tree" system with 20% fewer parts to cut costs and increase production speed. This move signals a recognition by American legacy automakers that they must fundamentally change their production models to survive.</p>
