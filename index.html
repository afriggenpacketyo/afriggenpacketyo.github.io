          <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee extended an invitation to students affected by the United States' attempted ban on international student enrollment at Harvard University, offering them an opportunity to continue their studies in Hong Kong. Lee emphasized that Hong Kong's doors are open to students facing discriminatory treatment in the US. The city doubled its quota for non-local student enrollment at publicly-funded universities last September, providing around 30,000 places. This move comes after the US Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard‚Äôs ability to enroll foreign nationals, a decision later temporarily restrained by a federal court.</p>

The increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged approach that relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake submissions. Boosting and member fraud constitute the majority of fake reviews, while paid reviews are a smaller but more pernicious category.</p>

          <p>Disabled people and public figures are campaigning against proposed benefits cuts in the UK, which would tighten eligibility for personal independence payment (Pip) and reduce universal credit. Critics argue that these cuts could have severe consequences for disabled individuals, potentially affecting their ability to afford essential equipment and support. There are fears that households could lose up to 58% of their income, exacerbating poverty among disabled families. Concerns are also raised about the accessibility and adequacy of support for disabled people in employment and emergency situations.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for a second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% compared to a year earlier, accelerating from 2.6% growth in March. The boost in profits is largely attributed to Beijing's efforts to support the private sector, offsetting some of the negative impacts from U.S. tariffs. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry climbed 9% from January to April, with notable improvement in the biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian wheat inventories are expected to be higher than last year due to a drop in Chinese imports and competition from Russia, pressuring prices. Analysts suggest a fire sale of stored grain may be necessary before the new wheat harvest, potentially pushing prices down. Australia's wheat shipments to China have significantly decreased compared to previous years. The next Northern Hemisphere wheat harvest, including Russia's, will add to the global supply, limiting Australia's export prospects.</p>

The series creator, Bruce Miller, aimed to tell a female-forward story from the female point of view, adjusting camera angles to align with Moss's height.
