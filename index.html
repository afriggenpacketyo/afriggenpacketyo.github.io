          <p>North Korea's state media reported that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test-firing of two new types of antiair missiles, aimed at enhancing capabilities against aerial threats like drones. This development coincides with joint military drills by South Korea and the U.S., and a summit between South Korea's president and Japan's prime minister to discuss regional challenges. Kim's government continues to prioritize ties with nations confronting the United States, notably increasing military cooperation with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine.

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center reports it is moving north-northeast and is expected to strengthen, potentially becoming a hurricane by Monday before weakening. While forecast to remain over open ocean and well east of Bermuda, it could bring rough surf to the island. This follows an NOAA forecast for an above-normal hurricane season, indicating continued activity in the tropics.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García's case has become a focal point in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, following his mistaken deportation to El Salvador despite a judge's protection order. After his return to the U.S., he was arrested on new charges and subsequently threatened with deportation to Uganda, a country with no known connection to him. His lawyers contend these actions are vindictive, challenging what they describe as a haphazard rush to deport individuals without due process. This article underscores the controversial nature of current immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's market value dropped by nearly $100 million after its stock plunged following the release of a new, cleaner logo. The redesign, which removed the traditional overall-clad man, is part of a broader effort to modernize the 55-year-old chain's image. Wall Street's reaction and criticism from conservative commentators, who labeled the change 'woke,' highlight the risks of brand overhauls. Despite the company's assurance that its values remain unchanged, the incident has sparked debate among marketing experts and investors.</p>

          <p>At the closed Marineland Antibes, a male orca named Keijo is being sexually stimulated by trainers to prevent inbreeding with his mother, Wikie, due to strong sexual urges as he reaches adolescence. This unusual practice comes amid a stalemate over rehoming the orcas, as a French law banning marine zoo shows takes effect in December. Animal rights activists criticize the situation, with some questioning if semen collection is intended for sale to less regulated countries. The article highlights severe animal welfare issues and a failure to find a suitable sanctuary.</p>

          <p>Russian tourists have begun visiting North Korea's new Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone, a resort envisioned by Kim Jong Un to boost tourism. Anastasia Samsonova, one of the first visitors, described a tightly controlled experience with guards and a fixed itinerary, designed to prevent interaction with locals. Despite restrictions and a high cost, she enjoyed the immaculate, almost-empty beaches. The resort's construction has faced criticism over alleged worker mistreatment, and while North Korea aims to expand tourism, it deliberately limits foreign visitors to manage public perceptions of wealth disparities.</p>

          <p>Democratic governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut are challenging a Trump administration order that halted work on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project. The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited unspecified 'national security interests' for the stop-work order, which came after President Trump's directive to review existing wind energy leases. Governors and senators criticized the decision as politically motivated and linked it to alleged favors for the oil industry, arguing it jeopardizes climate goals and clean energy development.

          <p>UK and Indian researchers have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site in Tamil Nadu, India. These reconstructions offer insights into the region's early inhabitants, revealing features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries. The findings support claims of an independent urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580 BC, adding a new dimension to the subcontinent's historical narratives and sparking debate on race, culture, and heritage.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole after closely watched hearings, which were disrupted by the unexpected release of an audio recording from Erik's session. The inadvertent disclosure by prison officials sparked anger and accusations of creating a 'spectacle' from the brothers' relatives and legal team. Despite arguments that the audio release compromised fairness, the parole board proceeded with its decisions. Both brothers will be eligible for parole again in three years, with the possibility of an earlier hearing in one year. The article details a contentious legal process.</p>

          <p>Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are criticizing the Justice Department for providing Epstein-related files that are largely already public, calling it 'stonewalling.' Rep. Ro Khanna stated only 3% of the 34,000 pages were new, primarily consisting of Customs and Border Protection flight logs for Epstein's plane. Democrats accuse the DOJ of a 'White House cover-up' and demand the full, unredacted release of files, while the committee continues its review.

          <p>Several major European parcel companies, including DHL and national post offices, have temporarily suspended some shipments to the U.S. The halt is in response to a new Trump administration executive order, effective August 29, which eliminates the 'de minimis' rule allowing duty-free entry for packages under $800. Shippers cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics for customs duties and data transmission. The White House defends the change as closing a 'catastrophic loophole' that reduced revenue and enabled illicit goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's economy is reportedly 'teetering on the brink of a recession,' facing a disastrous harvest due to climate volatility and a significant plunge in oil and gas revenues. Grain exports in July hit a 17-year low, and total grain production is projected to fall 18% from its peak. The Kremlin's main source of funds, energy revenue, tumbled 27% year-over-year in July, leading to widening budget deficits and a shrinking National Wealth Fund. Experts suggest this fiscal crunch will encumber Russia's war effort. (not investment advice)</p>
