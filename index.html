          <p>Elon Musk stated he intends to significantly decrease his political donations in the future, a shift from his previous role as a major backer of President Donald Trump's campaign. At the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk explained that he feels he has "done enough" in terms of political spending, although he left open the possibility of future donations if he sees a compelling reason. Musk previously spent over $250 million supporting Trump's reelection and more than $19 million aiding Republicans in the 2024 congressional elections. His super PAC, America PAC, also heavily invested in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election.</p>

          <p>An inquest concluded that the death of 11-year-old Kyra Hill, who drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire in August 2022, was an unlawful killing due to gross breaches in health and safety. The coroner cited the lack of an emergency plan, risk assessment, and falsely reassuring warning signs as contributing factors. The absence of information for parents regarding the risks and water depth, along with poor visibility, also played a role in the tragedy. The owner of the park was previously fined Â£80,000 in June 2024. Kyra's father described her as a strong swimmer whose life was tragically cut short.</p>

The decision follows what appears to be a compromise involving a gas pipeline agreement with the state. The project, which will be the first to deliver electricity directly to New York City, had been temporarily stopped due to concerns raised by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum regarding the project's approval process. Governor Kathy Hochul stated that the project supports 1,500 union jobs, and Equinor aims to begin commercial operations in 2027.</p>

Despite suffering immense losses, Ukrainians emphasize the need to rely on themselves and their allies, viewing Trump's diplomatic efforts as detached from the realities of the conflict. While a call between Trump and Putin did not yield any concessions from Russia, some Ukrainians see it as a potential reduction in pressure, as Trump has previously suggested unfavorable terms for Ukraine.

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," explores the Democratic Party's awareness and response to Joe Biden's physical and mental decline leading up to the 2024 election. Authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson detail how many within the party, White House staff, and campaign were aware of Biden's diminishing capabilities but remained largely silent, driven by partisanship, political calculation, and a belief in the Biden mythology. The book suggests that instances of Biden's decline were frequent and worsened around periods of family turmoil, such as the death of his son Beau and the legal troubles of his son Hunter. The authors highlight how efforts to conceal Biden's condition became a self-fulfilling political necessity.</p>

The escape went unnoticed for several hours, and authorities suspect the inmates received help from someone within the sheriff's office.

Experts recommend HELOCs for short-term financing needs with manageable payments, while reverse mortgages are more suitable for seniors with limited income seeking to age in place.

          <h2>Key Allies Criticize Israel's Gaza Offensive</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare joint statement criticizing Israel's renewed military offensive in Gaza, describing it as "disproportionate" and demanding a halt to the campaign and restrictions on humanitarian aid. The criticism highlights growing rifts between Israel and its traditional Western allies over the conflict. Prime Minister Netanyahu responded by accusing the three countries of encouraging further attacks. The United States, Israel's closest ally, has not publicly criticized the offensive, but President Trump has bypassed Netanyahu in negotiations with Hamas.</p>

          <p>Despite a major new deal between the UK and the European Union covering trade, defense, fishing, and energy, several key questions remain unanswered. These include the exact amount the UK will pay for access to certain benefits, the number of people who will benefit from the youth visa scheme, and when British travelers can use e-gates at EU airports. Uncertainty also surrounds whether it will be easier for British bands to tour Europe and if UK qualifications will be recognized in the EU. Negotiations are ongoing on these issues.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision that could allow asset managers to offer exchange-traded fund (ETF) share classes of existing mutual funds. This move would provide investors with more choices but also raises potential tax risks. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief to offer this structure, with Vanguard currently being one of the only companies to offer this. The SEC's primary concern is whether co-mingling the funds could result in ETF holders facing unexpected tax bills.</p>

In her new book, she contends that the left often misunderstands working-class values and priorities.

The combination of high tariffs and attacks on social security is a unique opportunity for Democrats if they do not squander it.</p>
