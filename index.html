          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed ongoing discussions with the U.S. government regarding the export of a new, more advanced AI chip, the B30A, to China. This follows previous U.S. restrictions on semiconductor sales, driven by concerns over potential Chinese military use. Huang argues that allowing Nvidia to sell advanced chips ensures China's AI infrastructure relies on American technology, rather than enabling local companies like Huawei to develop their own. However, the situation is complicated by reports of Chinese officials feeling insulted by U.S. statements and actively discouraging the purchase of Nvidia's current H20 chips, highlighting significant geopolitical and economic tensions in the tech sector.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will lift billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on most U.S. goods, effective September 1st. This decision, made after a recent discussion with President Donald Trump, aims to restore free trade for a significant portion of cross-border commerce, particularly for goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA). However, Canada will maintain its 25% tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum, indicating that negotiations in these strategic sectors are still ongoing. The White House welcomed the move as "long overdue," signaling a cautious step toward de-escalation in trade tensions between the two North American partners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that his administration's anti-crime efforts, currently focused on Washington D.C., could soon extend to Chicago, which he described as "a mess." He criticized Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson as "grossly incompetent" and claimed that the city's residents are "screaming" for federal assistance to combat its high crime rates. Trump expressed confidence that tackling crime in Chicago would not be difficult, suggesting it would be the next target after the D.C. initiative. This statement signals a potential expansion of federal involvement in local law enforcement matters, aligning with his broader agenda to "make our country very safe" and address urban crime perceived as out of control.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced significant skepticism about lowering interest rates, emphasizing the persistent threat of inflation. Despite market anticipation for cuts following Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments, Hammack stressed that inflation has remained above target for four years, necessitating a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring it under control. She noted her belief that the "neutral" interest rate, which neither boosts nor restricts activity, is higher than most other Fed officials, making her wary of any accommodative policy that could reignite inflationary pressures. Hammack, though not a voting member this year, underscores a cautious viewpoint within the Fed regarding monetary policy adjustments, highlighting internal divisions on the path forward.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the FBI's investigation into former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, which included a raid on his Maryland home and Washington D.C. office, is not politically motivated by Bolton's criticism of President Trump. Vance confirmed the probe is in its early stages and involves classified documents, alongside broader concerns about Bolton. He contrasted the current administration's approach with that of the Biden administration, asserting that law enforcement actions are driven by law, not politics, and that prosecutions would follow if a crime is confirmed. This comes as Trump himself denied prior knowledge of the raid, while still publicly referring to Bolton as a "lowlife."</p>

          <p>Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's younger brother, publicly asserted that his brother "deserves to be paid" for his work at Tesla, noting Elon has received no cash salary for years. This statement comes amidst an ongoing legal battle over Elon Musk's 2018 $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge ordered revoked, the largest compensation plan in U.S. history for a public company executive. Tesla's board recently granted an "interim" package of 96 million shares, worth about $29 billion, contingent on the appeal's outcome and without immediate shareholder approval. The SOC Investment Group has since urged Nasdaq to investigate Tesla for this move, raising significant questions about corporate governance and executive compensation practices within the company.

The RMT union strike will particularly affect CrossCountry rail services, leading to cancellations and alterations, with a second strike on Monday further limiting services on all CrossCountry lines. Additionally, ferry passengers at the Port of Dover faced nearly two-hour queues on Friday, and the RAC warned of heavy traffic on major motorways, especially the M5.

          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security benefits, with the average monthly payment just under $2,000, but many are unaware that their benefits are not fixed and can be reduced by several factors. This article highlights three main ways checks can shrink: the earnings test for those working before their full retirement age, automatic deductions for Medicare Part B premiums (which can increase significantly for high-income earners through Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts), and federal income taxes on benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds. Understanding these potential pitfalls is crucial for retirement planning, as reductions can amount to hundreds of dollars monthly, impacting essential expenses. The article also suggests options like reverse mortgages or part-time work to supplement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida State Senator Joe Gruters, a staunch ally of President Trump and former treasurer of the RNC, has been unanimously elected as the new chairman of the Republican National Committee at its summer meeting in Atlanta. Gruters, endorsed by Trump, succeeds Michael Whatley and is tasked with expanding GOP majorities in the House and Senate for the midterms, and preparing for the presidential election. His election underscores the growing influence of Florida Republicans within the national party and administration, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. With over $84 million cash on hand, the RNC faces the challenge of typical midterm seat losses for the party in power, amidst an agenda that includes extending tax cuts and boosting immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech at Jackson Hole significantly boosted market confidence, particularly for cyclical stocks, by signaling likely interest rate cuts. Powell indicated that with policy in "restrictive territory" and rising downside risks to employment, adjusting the policy stance may be warranted. He also suggested that tariff-driven inflation might be a temporary, "one-time hit" rather than an embedded inflationary spiral, despite acknowledging visible effects. This led to a jump in odds for multiple rate cuts this year, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit new highs and sectors like consumer discretionary, real estate, and industrials to rally strongly, reflecting investor focus on companies poised for earnings estimate revisions.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain a reliable and popular savings option, offering guaranteed returns and principal protection, especially with current rates around the 4% range. This article details how much a $10,000 deposit can earn across various common terms, from 3 months to 5 years, assuming no early withdrawal penalties or fees. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.30% APY would yield about $430, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% APY could earn approximately $2,100, leveraging the effect of compounding. CDs provide predictability and FDIC insurance up to $250,000, making them an appealing choice for savers looking to lock in competitive rates before potential future declines in interest rates.

The article questions why the tennis icon, long celebrated for defying toxic beauty standards and embodying strength, would align with an industry criticized for over-prescription and contributing to "thinness culture." Williams stated the medicine helped her achieve a healthy weight after childbirth, emphasizing she took no "shortcuts" and had exhausted other methods. However, critics view the partnership as a calculated commercial move, especially given her husband's board position at Ro, and lament it as a diminishment of her athletic legacy and a reinforcement of societal pressures she once resisted.</p>

          <p>Over 2,000-year-old artifacts, including ancient statues, Roman coins, and a merchant ship, have been recovered from a sunken city in Abu Qir Bay off Egypt's coast. Authorities suggest the site may be an extension of Canopus, a prominent center during the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Roman Empire, which was submerged over time by a series of earthquakes and rising sea levels. Notable finds include limestone structures that may have served as places of worship, residential spaces, and statues of royal figures, including a partially preserved sphinx of Ramses II. The discoveries offer invaluable insights into ancient Egyptian history, though the modern city of Alexandria faces a similar threat of submersion due to climate change and rising sea levels.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that National Guard troops deployed in Washington D.C. for President Trump's anti-crime crackdown will now be armed with their service-issued weapons. This decision marks an escalation in the federal intervention in the nation's capital, where nearly 2,000 Guard members are stationed, with hundreds arriving from Republican-led states. Previously, the Pentagon stated troops would not carry weapons, and their role has largely been limited to protecting landmarks and crowd control, with no apparent threats requiring armament. The move comes despite local officials reporting declining violent crime and asserting the initiative is unnecessary, raising questions about the Guard's evolving role and the justification for arming them.</p>

However, the momentum is expected to stall significantly through August, September, and October, with box office analysts predicting a "bereft" period until late November. Major releases like Universal's "Wicked: For Good" and "Zootopia 2" are anticipated to revitalize sales towards the year-end, signaling a strong fourth quarter after a quieter fall season.</p>
