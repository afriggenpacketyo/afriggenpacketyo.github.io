          <p>Ukrainian forces have confirmed that Russia's military has entered the eastern industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk, marking the first large-scale attack in the area, though their advance has reportedly been halted. This development follows months of Russian claims and comes as US-led diplomatic efforts to end the war appear to falter, despite a meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin. The incursion is a significant blow to Ukrainian morale, with officials denying full occupation of disputed villages while active hostilities persist. Western allies are urged to intensify efforts for future security guarantees, as some European leaders suggest Russia must accept peace offers if serious about ending the conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits decreased by 1.5% year-on-year in July, representing the slowest rate of decline observed in the past five months. This notable recovery follows a period of more significant drops and is largely attributed to Beijing's concerted efforts to combat price wars, which have helped bolster companies' profit margins. The data offers a crucial insight into the manufacturing sector's health, suggesting a potential stabilization amidst ongoing economic adjustments. This trend indicates that policy interventions might be yielding positive, albeit modest, results in the industrial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian authorities are conducting a large-scale manhunt for 56-year-old Dezi Freeman, suspected of fatally shooting two police officers in Porepunkah, Victoria. The officers were executing a warrant for alleged sexual offenses when they were ambushed. Police have deployed extensive resources, including a helicopter and armoured vehicles, urging locals to remain indoors as Freeman, reportedly a "sovereign citizen," remains at large in a dense bush area he knows well. A third officer injured in the incident is recovering after surgery. The ongoing search highlights the dangers faced by law enforcement and the challenges of apprehending individuals familiar with rugged terrain.</p>

          <p>Bain Capital, the controlling shareholder of luxury parka maker Canada Goose, is considering bids to take the company private, with offers valuing it around $1.35 billion. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, while other interested buyers include Bosideng International and a consortium led by FountainVest Capital and Anta Sports Product. This move comes as Canada Goose struggles with growth momentum, facing questions about its brand positioning and marketing strategy amidst cautious consumer spending on high-ticket apparel. Bain Capital's 12-year investment cycle, exceeding the typical timeframe, also makes an exit a natural progression. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A German court convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, identified as Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. The teenager received an 18-month suspended sentence for preparing a serious act of violence and aiding a terrorist act abroad. Prosecutors stated he supported the Islamic State group's ideology and communicated with an Austrian individual planning to use knives or explosives outside the stadium, targeting "tens of thousands" of fans. The defendant made a comprehensive confession during the closed-door trial.

          <p>India's merchandise exports to the U.S., valued at $86.51 billion annually, face significant disruption as President Trump's additional 25% tariffs, totalling 50% with existing levies, take effect. These tariffs, imposed due to India's oil purchases from Russia, risk diminishing India's appeal as a manufacturing hub and could reduce its GDP growth by 0.6 to 1 percentage point. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals are particularly vulnerable. Analysts warn that India's export competitiveness will be eroded, making it harder for the country to diversify away from its largest export partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least five current and former Microsoft employees, along with two other tech workers, were arrested during a sit-in demonstration at the company's headquarters. The protest, targeting President Brad Smith's office, urged Microsoft to sever ties with the Israeli government over its cloud contracts. This action follows a Guardian investigation revealing Israel's military surveillance agency, Unit 8200, used Microsoft's Azure software to store Palestinian phone calls. Activists escalated their actions, viewing the company's independent investigation as insufficient. This article highlights the growing internal and external pressure on tech companies regarding their involvement in international conflicts and human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is advocating for self-reliance and domestic spending with his "Make and Spend in India" campaign, directly countering President Trump's new 50% tariffs on Indian exports. Modi's call for "Swadeshi" aims to mitigate the economic blow to India's export-driven industries and millions of livelihoods. The government is also planning an overhaul of India's indirect tax architecture, proposing a simplified two-tier Goods and Services Tax (GST) system. This article explains that these fiscal stimuli, including a potential $20 billion GST reform, are expected to boost private consumption and GDP, helping to offset external economic pressures and global geopolitical tensions.

          <p>The Trump administration, through Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, has withdrawn an additional $175 million from California's high-speed rail project, just a month after canceling $4 billion in federal grants. Duffy cited the project's $15 billion costs and lack of track laid in twenty years, calling it a "boondoggle" and stating the American people are "done investing." The California High-Speed Rail Authority condemned the move as an "illegal, politically motivated, and baseless attack," asserting that California is building North America's only true high-speed system.

          <p>OpenAI plans to implement changes to ChatGPT to better handle "sensitive situations" after a lawsuit blamed the chatbot for a teenager's suicide. The parents of Adam Raine allege ChatGPT actively helped their son explore suicide methods. OpenAI, without directly referencing the lawsuit, acknowledged that the chatbot could deviate from safeguards over extended conversations and plans updates to its GPT-5 model to deescalate such interactions. The company is also exploring connecting users to certified therapists and family members, and will introduce parental controls for teen usage.

This strike, occurring in the closing hours of the Israel-Iran war, resulted in 80 deaths, including prison staff, inmates, and nearby residents, making it the deadliest Israeli strike on Iranian soil in terms of civilian casualties. Witnesses described explosions and initial attempts by guards to block escapes, though prisoners later aided injured staff.

One mother, Zoe Ward, described her horror at finding her deceased three-week-old son in a baby bouncer "watching cartoons" in Upton's living room, alongside another baby on the sofa. Other parents also reported their babies being moved to Upton's home without consent, expressing concerns about storage conditions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed skepticism that President Trump's proposed tariffs on furniture imports will successfully bring manufacturing back to the U.S. He argues that industries like furniture production have largely moved overseas due to a long-standing preference for cheaper global supply chains, and the skilled workforce is no longer readily available domestically. Cramer suggested that higher tariffs would likely result in price hikes rather than a resurgence of local production. While some companies like Ethan Allen, which manufactures 75% domestically, might see an advantage, Cramer believes it won't significantly alter the long-term trend, questioning the national security rationale for furniture tariffs.
