          <h2>New Budget Bill Introduces Charitable Tax Deduction for Non-Itemizers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new budget bill signed into law introduces a significant tax break for charitable contributions, aimed at the majority of taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. The provision allows single filers to deduct up to $1,000 and married couples up to $2,000 for donations to qualified charities, directly reducing their taxable income. This change, part of a larger legislative package, makes charitable giving tax-deductible for an estimated 90% of filers who typically opt for the standard deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House has passed a sweeping tax-and-spending package in a close 218-214 vote, sending the legislation to the president for his signature. The bill, a key part of the administration's domestic agenda, includes trillions in tax cuts and increased immigration enforcement, offset by cuts to social programs like Medicaid. Despite some Republican opposition over deficit concerns, party leadership successfully secured the votes after a prolonged overnight session, marking a major political victory for the administration.</p>

          <p>A satirical article from The Atlantic envisions the founding fathers observing the recent chaotic passage of a major bill through Congress, expressing mock approval for the convoluted process. The piece humorously portrays James Madison and Alexander Hamilton discussing the 940-page bill, the marathon overnight votes, and the intense political pressure as a "perfect" execution of their design. The satire highlights the stark contrast between the idealized vision of government and the messy, partisan reality of modern American lawmaking.</p>

The indictment also states that a chemical compound used to tranquilize wildlife, which Barry Morphew had access to, was found in her system, suggesting she was drugged before her death.</p>
