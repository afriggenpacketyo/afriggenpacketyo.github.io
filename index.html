          <p>Following the contentious ouster of CDC Director Susan Monarez, Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill has been named as the acting head of the agency. O'Neill, a former tech investor with ties to Peter Thiel and an associate of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., takes the helm amidst significant turmoil, including multiple high-level resignations. Kennedy expressed his hope to rebuild the institution, while critics point to the ongoing upheaval and the administration's controversial views on vaccines as a source of instability within the nation's top public health agency.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber achieved a rare feat in baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against Atlanta. His performance, which included a team-record nine RBIs, makes him the 21st player in MLB history to accomplish this and the first Phillie to do so since Mike Schmidt in 1976. The impressive display of power also propelled Schwarber into the lead for the National League home run title with 49 and brought him to the top of the MLB for RBIs with 119.</p>

          <p>Thailand's political future hangs in the balance as the Constitutional Court prepares to rule on the fate of suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The case centers on accusations of poor ethical standards following a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, which critics claim undermined the Thai military. A ruling to remove her from office could plunge the nation into political paralysis, as there is no clear successor, potentially destabilizing the government just weeks after a ceasefire in deadly border clashes with Cambodia.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing Kilmar Abrego Garcia have filed a motion asking a federal judge to order Trump administration officials to cease making "prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements" about their client. The filing argues that high-level officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump himself, have publicly vilified Abrego Garcia, potentially tainting the jury pool and jeopardizing his right to a fair trial. This legal action comes amid an ongoing and complex case involving charges of transporting undocumented migrants and repeated attempts by the administration to deport him.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed an international network of spammers creating and posting fake, AI-generated images of Holocaust victims on Facebook to generate engagement and profit from Meta's content monetization program. These "AI slop" images, often accompanied by fabricated stories, are causing distress to survivors and their families, with organizations like the Auschwitz Memorial criticizing the practice as a "dangerous distortion" of history. The investigation traced many of these accounts to content creators who exploit tragic historical events to attract high-value views from Western audiences, turning a solemn commemoration into an "emotional game."</p>

          <p>The National Health Service will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales starting in January 2026. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, and a catch-up program is planned for slightly older children. Previously available only through private payment, this move is expected to protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus. It also aims to reduce the economic impact on families by preventing parents from needing to take time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has used his executive authority to overrule a board-approved plan to display Israeli flags on all school campuses. The decision to halt the display, which was part of a resolution to combat antisemitism, was made due to "heightened safety concerns" for students and staff. The initial 3-to-2 board vote was contentious, with supporters viewing it as a stand against antisemitism, while critics and some board members argued it was an inappropriate political statement for a public school and could make campuses a target.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own independent cost analysis before initiating the largest reorganization of local councils in England in decades, a BBC investigation has learned. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner claimed the mergers would save "a significant amount of money," basing estimates on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the reforms could potentially cost money and deliver no savings, raising concerns among critics that the government is proceeding with major structural changes without up-to-date evidence to justify them.</p>

The attack, which also destroyed a residential building, has been widely condemned as a deliberate escalation and a mockery of peace efforts, prompting calls for new and tougher sanctions against Russia.</p>

Although this specific fish was sterile, grass carp pose a significant threat to native ecosystems because they can consume up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, destroying habitats for native fish and birds. These fish have already begun reproducing in U.S. rivers connected to the Great Lakes, and authorities are urging the public to report any sightings and not release them back into the water.</p>
