          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are expected to resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program to significantly reduce the federal workforce. This comes as Congress faces a deadline for government funding, with the White House ordering agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if a deal isn't reached. Workers cite "fear and intimidation" and a feeling of having their mission stripped away as reasons for their departure. This article highlights deep tensions between the administration and federal employees.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's ambition to adopt green marine fuels hinges on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy president Wang Yongxin. While the city has initiated liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, green methanol requires a tax-free system for mainland-produced fuel to be imported, stored, and sold. Wang spoke at the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional and methanol fuels. This article notes the company plans to increase green methanol usage from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs, despite the fuel costing four times more.

          <p>Whistleblowers and former patients have exposed "unsafe" incidents and staff failings at Schoen Clinic York's specialist eating disorder unit, which recently closed. Photographs and testimonies reveal staff sleeping while on duty, patients self-harming without intervention, and unhygienic food being served. Patients reported feeling their condition worsened due to poor care, including triggering language from staff. The Care Quality Commission, which previously rated the service as "good," is now investigating concerns, while the clinic states issues were addressed without systemic problems, attributing food quality issues to a supplier, according to this article.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is requesting an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, despite two federal courts blocking it nationwide. The administration argues for a definitive judgment on its reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, which traditionally applies to all born in the U.S. regardless of parents' immigration status. Critics, including the ACLU, maintain the order is illegal and would strip citizenship from hundreds of thousands. This article reflects a significant policy battle over immigration and constitutional interpretation.</p>

          <p>Federal officials confirmed that Joshua Jahn, the shooter at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, specifically targeted ICE agents and acted alone. Notes found at his residence indicated animosity towards ICE, and he had planned the attack for some time, using apps to track agents. Jahn fired from a nearby rooftop, hitting a van and killing one detainee, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, and critically injuring two others. This article highlights how the incident has prompted blame on "wild rhetoric" for a significant increase in assaults on ICE officers.</p>

The lawsuit highlights that this article's reporting indicates Trump's information appears to rely on social media gossip and a Fox News report that allegedly mixed current protests with older footage from 2020.

          <p>Rachel Reeves, Labour's Chancellor, is set to announce a new initiative guaranteeing paid work placements for young people unemployed or out of education for 18 months.

With nearly a million 16-24-year-olds not in education, employment, or training, the program seeks to equip individuals with skills for full-time jobs, with private companies expected to contribute to wages.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to host the Cincinnati Reds in a best-of-three NL wild-card series, after the Reds clinched the final playoff spot despite an earlier 1.3% chance. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the Reds as a "gritty" and "hungry" young team, led by veteran manager Terry Francona. Key Reds threats include young star Elly De La Cruz, who led the team in several offensive categories, and a strong pitching rotation featuring hard-throwing Hunter Greene. This article notes that recent playoff history suggests road teams often succeed in wild-card series, adding an unpredictable element for the favored Dodgers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels concluded another last-place season, marking the first time in 50 years they've finished at the bottom in consecutive years, raising questions about owner Arte Moreno's strategy. Despite management acknowledging "something is not right" five years ago, the team's performance has not improved under current general manager Perry Minasian. Moreno, 79, explored selling the team previously but is not expected to this winter, possibly awaiting collective bargaining negotiations for a potential salary cap. This article details how the team faces significant challenges with weak player depth, sloppy fundamentals, and a payroll that ranks in the middle third of MLB.</p>
