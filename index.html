          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for another round of peace talks brokered by the U.S. after a surprise drone attack by Ukraine on strategic bomber bases deep inside Russian territory. Ukraine is seeking a full ceasefire, prisoner release, and the return of abducted children, while Russia insists on annexing Ukrainian regions and blocking Ukraine's NATO accession. Despite Trump's threats of further sanctions on Russia, the Kremlin's war goals remain maximalist, and a Ukrainian parliament member suggests Russia is using the talks to avoid sanctions while planning a summer offensive. The article notes that long-range drone and missile attacks continued overnight into Monday morning, with both sides claiming to have shot down numerous drones. Optimism surrounding the potential for these talks to yield significant progress is low. </p>

          <p>Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory is a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that predicted a win for Trzaskowski, leading to early victory claims from his camp. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda and re-energize the national conservative Law and Justice opposition party. While both candidates support continued aid to Ukraine, they differ on their approach to the EU, with Nawrocki favoring a strong sovereign Poland and opposing further ceding of powers to Brussels.</p>

          <p>A lion killed a 59-year-old businessman, Bernd Kebbel, at a luxury safari lodge in Namibia after he left his tent to use the toilet early in the morning.

Kebbel was known as a philanthropist who supported wildlife conservation in Namibia. Desert-adapted lions roam the remote northwest of Namibia, but their numbers have recently declined due to drought and conflict with humans.</p>

Mayor Eric Adams attributes this success to precision policing, strategic resource deployment, and the NYPD's dedication. The police have also removed approximately 22,000 illegal guns from the streets since Adams took office, but Adams stresses the importance of New Yorkers feeling safer, not just being safer.</p>

          <p>Parents whose children participated in Covid vaccine clinical trials are expressing anger and dismay as the Trump administration considers new clinical trials and restrictions on Covid vaccines for children. They feel their children's contributions are being ignored, and question the ethics of new placebo-controlled trials when the benefits of the vaccines are already known. Changes in recommendations could affect doctors' and parents' understanding of vaccine safety and effectiveness, and potentially impact insurance coverage. These parents worry about limited access to vaccines and the implications of what they see as a 'war on children'.</p>

          <p>Several National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices along the Gulf of Mexico coast are understaffed as the hurricane season begins, raising concerns about the ability to prepare communities for incoming hurricanes. Fifteen regional weather service offices lack meteorologists, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is short five specialists. These staffing shortages are attributed to job cuts and a hiring freeze imposed by the Trump administration, with over 600 staff departing the NWS since Trump took power. Experts warn that the turmoil within the NWS and FEMA will hamper the response to potential storms, floods, and wildfires, but the NHC maintains that it has sufficient forecasters to fulfill operational shifts during the hurricane season.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget is facing criticism for significantly increasing the federal debt and disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. The bill would cut taxes for the top 1% of wage earners while slashing the social safety net, including Medicaid and SNAP. These cuts would leave millions uninsured and potentially end food assistance for millions, including children. Critics argue that the bill exemplifies Republican hypocrisy, prioritizing tax breaks for the rich over the needs of working-class Americans. </p>

          <p>As the Senate debates President Trump's tax and spending package, changes to the child tax credit are being considered. The House-approved bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed via Trump's 2017 tax cuts and the highest credit would also rise to $2,500 from 2025 to 2028. The Senate could have different plans, and negotiations will be "really interesting to watch," according to policy experts.

          <p>A university teaching assistant discusses the dilemma of students using AI to cheat on assignments, and the ethical implications of enforcing rules in an environment where students don't take the institution seriously. The author argues that the real value of a humanities education is the cultivation of character and practical wisdom, which is threatened by the ease of AI-generated writing. To combat this, the author suggests adding friction back into the learning process by allowing students to use AI but requiring them to reflect on how it changed their thinking and learning.</p>

          <p>Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, the drummer and focal performer for the Roots, discusses his new documentary, “Ladies & Gentlemen … 50 Years of SNL Music.” The film compresses a half-century of archival “SNL” footage into a history of culture-shaking highlights and behind-the-scenes revelations. Questlove explains that the key to the documentary was focusing on the moment right before an artist's breakthrough. He also discusses his upcoming feature project about 1970s R&B supergroup Earth, Wind & Fire.</p>

          <p>The second season of 'Wolf Hall' faced significant budget constraints, with costs doubling over the past decade due to the rise of streaming services. Producers, the screenwriter, and the leading actor, Mark Rylance, gave back portions of their paychecks to get 'Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light' off the ground. The production team had to cut costs and reassemble original department heads, including costume designer Joanna Eatwell, who had to start from scratch. Despite the challenges, the cast and crew were proud of what they accomplished, and Damian Lewis noted that the show proves that if something's good, people will come and find it.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to curtail or destroy institutions such as PBS, NPR, Harvard, and the Smithsonian, raising concerns about his desire for cultural dominance. He has ordered a halt to public financing for PBS and NPR, and threatened to defund elite universities that refuse to take government dictation. Trump has also dismantled Voice of America, taken over programming at the Kennedy Center, and interfered with the curatorial autonomy of the Smithsonian. Critics argue that these actions undermine the democratic haven and cultural center that these institutions have provided for decades.</p>

          <p>California legislators are poised to overhaul the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark environmental law, with two proposals advancing rapidly through the Legislature. One proposal would eliminate the law for most urban housing developments, and the other would weaken the rules for most other projects. These changes are the most profound to CEQA in generations, aiming to address the state's housing shortage and infrastructure challenges. Opponents argue that the changes would restrict community groups' ability to shape development and reduce the polluting effects of projects in overburdened neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>California is on the verge of mandating phonics-based reading instruction in schools, marking a significant shift in the state's approach to literacy. The proposed law would require districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading," a systemic approach to literacy instruction supported by decades of research. This move comes after decades of debate and controversy in California on how best to teach reading amid persistently low test scores. The bill has gained support from teachers unions and advocates for English-language learners after compromises were made to provide school districts with more flexibility in selecting instructional materials.</p>

Critics argue that the legislation needs clear, binding directives to ensure regulators protect the public interest and fight corruption.

          <p>New wildfire protection regulations in California propose prohibiting almost all plants within 5 feet of homes, but experts argue this could be detrimental. Well-maintained plants can protect homes from wind-blown embers and slow fire spread. Research shows that moisture in plants can prevent ignition, and green vegetation can act as a heat sink, absorbing energy and blocking embers. The proposed regulations oversimplify complex conditions and go beyond current scientific research, with experts recommending a focus on plant maintenance and home hardening instead of widespread vegetation removal.</p>

The plans are also aiming at helping reduce aviation's climate change impacts and pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis. The changes would allow the largest re-design of UK airspace since it was first formed in the 1950s, when there were only around 200,000 flights a year, compared to 2.7 million last year.</p>
