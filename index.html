          <p>Daisy Crawford, traveling from Bristol to Belfast with breast milk and a pump, was told by EasyJet staff that she would need to pay an additional charge for her hand luggage, despite researching the rules beforehand. She was allowed to travel out of Belfast without any issues, but faced problems on the return journey at the gate. EasyJet has since apologized for the incident, stating that they allow customers an additional free bag for breast pumps and milk, and that Ms. Crawford's experience did not meet their expected service standards. Ms. Crawford expressed embarrassment and frustration over the lack of understanding from the staff, emphasizing she wasn't seeking special exceptions but simply adhering to what she believed were the airline's policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is generating concern within the medical community, as it promotes the use of psychotherapy for children and teens with gender dysphoria, instead of gender-affirming care. The report reviews transgender care for youth and cites alleged harms from medical interventions like puberty blockers, and alleged risks such as infertility. Medical experts argue that gender-affirming care, which is supported by major medical organizations, can greatly improve mental health and that psychotherapy alone is not a substitute. The American Academy of Pediatrics has expressed deep alarm over the HHS report, stating that it misrepresents the current medical consensus and doesn't reflect the realities of pediatric care.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump, facing renewed impeachment threats from House Democrats, suggested that Republicans should consider expelling Democrats from Congress for what he claims are "REAL crimes." Trump criticized the Democrats' impeachment efforts as politically motivated and asserted that Republicans should retaliate by expelling them. He also referenced 'Shifty' Adam Schiff and demanded a pardon, claiming that the Democrats used impeachment as a weapon against him during his first term. This article summarizes Trump's remarks and the political context surrounding the impeachment threats.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall may become the first UK zoo-born cat to be released into the wild, and has been moved to Germany to be monitored for its suitability. The lynx is being considered for release due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding program. The cat will be monitored in an enclosure to assess its survival skills and relationship with humans. If successful, the lynx will join efforts to increase genetic diversity among wild lynx populations in Europe and help control deer populations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions in his first 100 days in office have closely aligned with Project 2025, a conservative manifesto outlining policy goals for a second Trump term. Despite attempts to distance himself from the project during the campaign, Trump has appointed individuals associated with Project 2025 to key positions and implemented several of its proposals. These actions include consolidating power in the executive branch, dismantling the Department of Education, and ending climate change programs. Some of Trump's actions have even exceeded the scope of Project 2025's original recommendations.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is launching a campaign targeting vulnerable House Republicans over a bill that may cut social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP to fund tax cuts.

          <p>A recent poll indicates strong support for American reindustrialization, with 80% believing it would benefit the country. While only 25% feel they would personally benefit from working in manufacturing, this figure still represents a significant portion of the population and underscores the dissatisfaction with the current "knowledge economy". A strong manufacturing sector is linked to higher wages, economic stability, and national self-sufficiency. Reindustrialization is also seen as a politically viable strategy for winning back working-class voters.</p>

          <p>After his first 100 days in office, President Trump is facing a decline in public support across several key areas, including the economy, trade, and immigration. His overall favorability has decreased, driven by negative reactions to his tariff policies and immigration enforcement. While some of his positions, such as targeted tariffs on China, still garner support, the public has largely turned against his actions. This shift in public opinion presents political challenges for Republicans and highlights the risk of overestimating the public's appetite for significant change.</p>

This trend raises concerns about increased workplace injuries and deaths among minors, as well as the exploitation of vulnerable young workers. The article argues that these rollbacks are a moral test for America, recalling Franklin Roosevelt's condemnation of child labor as an "ancient atrocity."</p>

As the women experience ghostly phenomena and uncover hidden truths, a queer romance develops between Nora and Madeline. The novel explores themes of family secrets, exploitation, and queer love, though its attempt to tie the mansion's haunting to Chinese migrant exploitation falls short.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for disrupting Alzheimer's research, including the temporary termination of a $53-million NIH-funded study at UC Davis. Dr. Charles DeCarli, the study's director, believes the termination was due to the study's name referencing "diverse" populations, as DEI programs are on the administration's hit list. Although funding was eventually restored after an appeal, the disruption caused significant setbacks. Advocates and researchers express concern that these actions contradict claims of prioritizing biomedical research and could hinder progress in understanding and treating Alzheimer's, a disease affecting millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>Arcadia City Council member Eileen Wang addressed the controversy surrounding her former campaign manager, Yaoning “Mike” Sun, who has been charged with conspiracy and acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. Wang stated that she ended her romantic relationship with Sun months before the charges were filed and emphasized that she was not responsible for his actions. The charges allege that Sun worked with China to cultivate Wang in hopes of promoting pro-China policies, but Wang was never charged and it's unclear if she was aware of the alleged scheme. Campaign records show that Sun helped bring in donations, some from sources with ties to the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber argues that the SAVE Act, recently approved by the House, is a thinly veiled attempt to disenfranchise millions of eligible voters, particularly targeting underserved populations, those with name changes, and military personnel. Weber asserts that the bill, framed as preventing illegal voting, would impose unnecessary documentation requirements, creating barriers to participation and undermining decades of progress in voting rights. She highlights that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and that states already have measures in place to ensure election security. Weber is actively fighting back, including leading a lawsuit against an executive order requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the federal mail voter registration form.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residential burglaries have surged by 450% since January, prompting the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to deploy enhanced security cameras. While some residents welcome the increased surveillance, others feel it's insufficient and desire more robust measures, such as neighborhood checkpoints similar to those in Pacific Palisades. Residents like Natalie LaFourche, whose home was burglarized, argue that cameras are a minimal response compared to the National Guard presence previously utilized. Despite the Sheriff's Department's request, the California Office of Emergency Management denied redeployment of the National Guard, offering additional California Highway Patrol officers instead.</p>

          <p>According to a United Nations presentation, civilian deaths in Ukraine have increased significantly since cease-fire talks began in February, with Russian strikes targeting cities more intensively. The first months of this year, coinciding with peace talks, have been far deadlier than the same period last year. Analysts suggest that this increase in violence is not unusual during cease-fire talks, as warring armies often try to gain an advantage before a truce halts the fighting. Despite the ongoing negotiations, the situation remains tense, with both sides accusing each other of violating existing truces.</p>

The jobs data arrives days after a government report showed the U.S. economy shrank over the first three months of 2025, much of which took place as Trump's flurry of tariff proposals stoked uncertainty among businesses and consumers.</p>
