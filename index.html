            <p>A coalition of small businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, contesting the legality of his recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit, submitted to the U.S. Court of International Trade, argues that Trump has overstepped Congress' authority by declaring trade deficits an emergency, which they assert have existed for decades without causing economic harm. The businesses are represented by the Liberty Justice Center, which claims that the tariffs, including those designated as 'Liberation Day' tariffs, are negatively impacting small businesses across the country, even those trading with nations that do not have a trade deficit with the US. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate the tariffs and uphold the principle of no taxation without representation.</p>

            <p>Auto stocks experienced a boost on Monday after President Trump indicated his intention to 'help some of the car companies' affected by the recently implemented 25% auto tariffs. Trump suggested that automakers require additional time to shift their production to the United States, particularly concerning parts sourced from Canada and Mexico. Companies like Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis saw their shares rise, while others like Toyota and Honda also experienced gains. Automakers have responded to the tariffs in different ways, including offering employee pricing and ceasing U.S. shipments. (not investment advice)</p>

The arrest was a joint effort by ICE, the FBI, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, focusing on alleged fraudulent claims made by Morejon Garcia during his entry into the country. Authorities discovered official Cuban government documents and 'credible source information' indicating that he failed to disclose his membership in the Cuban Communist Party and his role as an agent of the Ministry of the Interior. He is also accused of serving as the President of the National Defense Council in the Artemisa region of Cuba and being a member of the Rapid Response Brigades.</p>

The FTC accuses Meta of anticompetitive conduct due to its ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing it gives the company excessive control over the social media market. The FTC seeks to force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, claiming Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing platforms.

            <p>President Trump indicated he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs to allow carmakers time to adjust their supply chains. He noted that automakers require time to relocate production from countries like Canada and Mexico to the U.S. Car manufacturers' supply chains are deeply intertwined with other nations, making fully American-made vehicles nearly impossible. Experts predict that the 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars could increase car prices significantly.</p>

            <p>An internal memorandum reveals that the Trump administration is proposing to slash the State Department budget by nearly half, potentially reducing U.S. international spending significantly. The proposed cuts would impact humanitarian assistance, global health, and international organizations, including NATO and the UN. The memo also suggests significant reductions to the State Department workforce and the elimination of programs like the Fulbright scholarship. The proposed budget cuts would need congressional approval and are likely to face strong opposition.</p>
