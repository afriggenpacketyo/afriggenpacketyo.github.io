          <p>Southern China's Guangdong province has elevated its typhoon alert to Level 1, the highest tier, as it braces for Super Typhoon Ragasa, anticipated to be the most powerful storm in recent years. Over ten cities, including the technology hub Shenzhen, have halted markets, schools, factories, and transport systems, urging residents to stay indoors and stockpile essentials like food and water. Shenzhen's airport and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge are closed, with Guangzhou canceling all flights until Wednesday evening, and Zhuhai cancelling 21 flights on Tuesday. Many online grocery shops are experiencing shortages of delivery staff and popular items like bread, underscoring the widespread preparations and public concern in the global manufacturing center.</p>

          <p>Chinese issuers, including struggling developer Seazen Group, are significantly increasing their activity in the offshore dollar bond market, marking the highest issuance level since 2022. Seazen, once a top-ten builder, is seeking another bond deal after a US$300 million offering earlier this year, aiming to refinance existing debt and support general corporate purposes. This renewed interest signals a reopening of financial channels that closed during China's property crisis and economic slowdown, as companies find more favorable refinancing terms. Total dollar note sales from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau have reached approximately US$80 billion in 2025, a 21% increase from the previous year, indicating a potential rebuilding of investor trust in the sector.

          <p>Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have jointly announced their immediate withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), labeling it an "instrument of neocolonial repression." The military-led West African states claim the ICC has proven "incapable" of prosecuting war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, accusing it of selective justice. This move, echoing their earlier withdrawal from ECOWAS, highlights their growing distance from Western influence and closer ties to Russia. The three nations, forming the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), intend to establish "indigenous mechanisms for the consolidation of peace and justice," as they face ongoing violence from jihadist groups and accusations of military misconduct.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order classifying the left-wing Antifa movement as a "domestic terrorist organization," citing a pattern of political violence aimed at suppressing lawful activity and obstructing the rule of law. The order directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle the decentralized movement, enabling action against individuals providing material support. This designation follows the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Trump blamed on left-wing rhetoric despite investigators not linking the suspect to any groups. Critics warn the order could expand surveillance powers and curb free speech, with legal experts noting a lack of precedent for such a domestic designation under US law.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue indicated that a highly anticipated meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping is more likely to occur next year rather than this fall. While Trump had previously suggested a meeting around a multilateral summit in South Korea next month, followed by reciprocal visits, the Chinese readout of their recent call did not include such details. Perdue's comments came during a rare visit by a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers to Beijing, where discussions included the potential presidential meeting and resolving differences over TikTok. The ambassador emphasized that the relationship between the two leaders is currently "very good and very encouraging."</p>

Operations resumed after about four hours in both locations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referenced "Russia's violation" of NATO airspace in Copenhagen, though EU and NATO leaders have not publicly attributed the incident.

This ruling follows a prior injunction that restored $81 million to UCLA from the National Science Foundation.

He highlights examples like Manchester United and Chelsea using long passes, and the growing importance of set-piece coaches, as seen with Arsenal.

Harris also reveals her preference for Pete Buttigieg as a running mate, but felt their combined identities would be a liability, and found Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro had "unrealistic expectations" for the Vice President role.

          <p>This article critically analyzes Stephen Miller's eulogy for Charlie Kirk, describing it as a "battle cry" for the Trump administration's "state-sponsored war" against perceived foes. Miller's speech, seen as a distillation of Trumpism, depicted opponents as "wickedness" destined for destruction, contrasting sharply with calls for unity. The article highlights Miller's perceived hypocrisy in demanding standards from enemies he doesn't uphold himself, and his conflation of political opposition with those responsible for Kirk's murder. It suggests the speech, rather than being an awakening, was a pretext to further an existing agenda of subjugation, intensifying America's political divisions.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne lauded the "remarkable" journalists who uncovered widespread phone hacking in the media, ahead of ITV's new drama "The Hack." Thorne, known for "Adolescence," initially perceived the scandal as solely about journalistic misconduct but now recognizes it as a troubling nexus between the press, politics, and police. The series will depict the story from the perspectives of investigative reporter Nick Davies and police detective Dave Cook. Thorne emphasized the bravery of these journalists in holding their own industry accountable, contrasting it with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal where journalism struggled for public traction until dramatization.</p>

          <p>Tesla has launched the Megablock, an advanced grid-battery upgrade designed to accelerate large-scale renewable energy projects. Comprising four Megapacks around a transformer, the Megablock requires minimal connections, promising to simplify electrical work and enable deployment of one gigawatt-hour of storage in just 20 days. Despite challenges in its EV sales this year, Tesla's energy-storage division, particularly the Megapack, has been a success, powering the world's largest wind farm and France's largest storage system. This innovation is crucial for integrating renewable energy into the grid and offers potential benefits for EV owners charging at home, marking a significant step in sustainable energy infrastructure.

          <h2>China Rejects Stripped-Down Nvidia Chips, Prioritizing Tech Independence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 21:30:08 EDT</div>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions of its advanced H20 line, despite them being a compromise solution from the US to maintain technological dependence. This article explains that Beijing views accepting these chips as acknowledging US-dictated tech inferiority and is instead pushing for complete technological independence. Following US restrictions on high-end AI chips, China's internal debate shifted from the desirability to the necessity of self-reliance in semiconductors. Regulators have reportedly halted purchases and initiated antitrust investigations into Nvidia, signaling a turning point in global technology politics where China prioritizes indigenous innovation over reliance on foreign suppliers.</p>

          <p>France has formally recognized a Palestinian state, joining a growing wave of nations taking this step, with President Emmanuel Macron stating at the UN that "the time for peace has come." This move, which Israel views as rewarding Hamas, comes amidst increasing international pressure over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and West Bank settlements. Macron emphasized the need to end the war, free hostages, and pursue a two-state solution for lasting peace. Other European nations are also set to recognize Palestine, while the US and some G7 members were absent from a summit focused on these plans, highlighting a division in international approach.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, in a press conference, urged pregnant women to "fight like hell" not to take Tylenol, asserting a link between the drug and autism, and also advised against giving it to young children. He also questioned childhood immunization schedules, stating his advice was based on "what I feel," rather than established scientific consensus. This stance contradicts medical experts and recent large studies that found no causal link between acetaminophen and autism. Critics fear the administration is pushing unsupported conclusions, potentially endangering public health by advising against a medication considered safe for pregnant women to treat fever and pain.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old boy in Sacramento County led sheriff's deputies on a high-speed pursuit, reaching speeds of up to 70 mph, after allegedly stealing his parents' truck to drive to his former school. The chase concluded when the boy crashed the truck into a patrol car and a parked vehicle. Fortunately, no one was injured during the incident. The boy was taken into custody on multiple charges, including assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer and vehicle theft, and is expected to be released to his parents, as California law allows minors aged 12 and over to be held criminally responsible in juvenile court.</p>

          <p>Disney has reinstated "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to air on Tuesday, following its suspension over comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. Disney initially suspended the show, deeming Kimmel's remarks "ill-timed and thus insensitive," after threats from the FCC chair to revoke ABC's broadcast license. The suspension sparked widespread backlash, with critics citing censorship and violations of free speech. Disney stated that "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel led to the reinstatement. However, some ABC affiliate groups, like Sinclair and Nexstar, previously vowed not to air the show, with Sinclair maintaining that discussions are ongoing regarding its potential return.</p>
