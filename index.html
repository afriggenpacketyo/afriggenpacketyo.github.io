          <p>Rushanara Ali has stepped down from her role as the UK's homelessness minister following accusations of hypocrisy. The controversy arose after it was revealed she increased the rent on a property she owns shortly after ending the previous tenants' contract, a practice her own government is seeking to outlaw through the Renters' Rights Bill. In her resignation letter, Ali stated that while she followed all legal requirements, remaining in her position would be a distraction from the government's work. The move was praised by renters' rights groups and opposition politicians, who had called her position untenable.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared with President Donald Trump to announce a $600 billion U.S. spending commitment over four years, a move seen as a strategic effort to appease the administration's demands for domestic manufacturing. While not committing to final iPhone assembly in the U.S., Apple highlighted expanded partnerships with American suppliers like Corning for glass and Coherent for sensor components. The announcement successfully secured Apple an exemption from new chip tariffs, demonstrating Cook's savvy navigation of political pressures. Experts view the spending as largely symbolic and incorporating existing expenses, but effective in managing White House relations.</p>

The piece also details a recent FBI investigation into an arson and graffiti incident in Missouri targeting a former IDF soldier. The article cites Anti-Defamation League data showing a significant increase in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. over the past five years, framing the issue as a growing national concern.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has nominated Stephen Miran, his chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Miran is set to fill the seat vacated by Adriana Kugler for a term ending in January 2026, a move seen as potentially temporary. The nomination aligns with Trump's push for lower interest rates and criticism of the current Fed leadership, as Miran is a known critic of the central bank's past stimulus measures. The appointment, which requires Senate confirmation, could introduce a dissenting voice aligned with the White House's economic policy preferences onto the board. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that President Trump is open to a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, even if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not present. This marks a shift from an earlier stance by a White House official, who had indicated that a meeting with Zelenskyy was a precondition for any summit with Putin. While a trilateral meeting remains the administration's stated preference to end the war in Ukraine, the new statement suggests a greater flexibility. The Kremlin had previously claimed a bilateral meeting was already agreed upon, though the White House says no details have been finalized.</p>

          <p>The sequel "Freakier Friday" reunites Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis but fails to recapture the magic of the 2003 original, according to this review. The new film expands the body-swapping premise to four characters, with Anna (Lohan) and her mother Tess (Curtis) swapping with their respective new step-daughter and step-granddaughter. While the chemistry between the original leads remains a highlight, the plot is described as hasty and unfocused, with underdeveloped characters and motivations. The review notes that the film's primary appeal is the nostalgia of seeing the cast together again, rather than any emotional depth or narrative coherence.</p>

CEO Adam Foroughi also suggested on the earnings call that the company stands to benefit significantly in the long term from the legal fallout between Apple and Epic Games.

          <p>Manchester United's significant summer spending on attacking players, including the £74m agreement for striker Benjamin Sesko, has shifted focus to a critical gap in their midfield. The team's current system under coach Ruben Amorim requires two deeper midfielders, but there are questions about the suitability of the current options for the role. Captain Bruno Fernandes is not a natural defensive midfielder, and other players like Manuel Ugarte have struggled with consistency. This has led the club to inquire about Brighton's Carlos Baleba, a box-to-box midfielder who fits the needed profile, though a high transfer fee presents a major obstacle.</p>

Proponents argue these investments offer diversification and higher potential returns, but critics highlight significant risks, including higher fees, a lack of transparency, and illiquidity. Advisors worry that unsophisticated investors may not understand the complexities of these assets, potentially leading to poor outcomes. While asset managers are creating new products for this market, experts believe adoption by plan administrators will be slow and deliberate due to fiduciary responsibilities and the difficulty in evaluating such investments.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted any new construction at the immigrant detention center in Florida known as 'Alligator Alcatraz,' granting a 14-day restraining order. The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. While the center can continue to house detainees, the order prevents further development while the court considers the case. The facility has been controversial due to what advocates call a jurisdictional gray zone, with state and federal officials unable to clarify who is ultimately in charge.</p>

The story begins with the mysterious disappearance of a classroom of third graders and splices together the perspectives of six different protagonists, including characters played by Julia Garner and Josh Brolin. The review praises the film's non-linear, overlapping narrative structure, which creates a sense of discovery and disorder. While some ideas feel underdeveloped, the film is lauded for its unsettling atmosphere, strong details, and a satisfyingly discontented ending that avoids easy answers.</p>
