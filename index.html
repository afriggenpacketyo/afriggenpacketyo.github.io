          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria to provide the country with an opportunity to stabilize under its new government, which took power after ousting Bashar al-Assad. Speaking in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump expressed hope that the new Syrian government would succeed in stabilizing the country and maintaining peace. He highlighted that his administration has already initiated steps to restore normal relations between the United States and Syria, marking the first such efforts in over a decade. The U.S. had previously designated Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following the Assad regime's crackdown on anti-government uprisings.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with their bill to fund President Trump‚Äôs agenda, which includes significant Medicaid cuts and tax changes, despite facing resistance from within their own party. The bill proposes Medicaid spending cuts by implementing work requirements for recipients, increasing the frequency of eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to unauthorized migrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the health portions of the bill would save approximately $715 billion over the next decade, but also projects that at least 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured. The legislation also addresses cultural issues, such as stripping Medicaid funding from organizations that provide abortion services. </p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis resulted in at least six fatalities and numerous injuries, according to local officials. Local sources reported that Israeli warplanes dropped six bombs simultaneously on the hospital, impacting both the inner courtyard and surrounding areas. The Israeli military stated that the strike was a "precise" operation targeting a Hamas base allegedly located beneath the hospital. The injured and deceased were subsequently transferred to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, which had also been struck earlier in the day.</p>

The fires include one at the prime minister's private residence in Kentish Town, north London, and another at a house converted into flats in Islington, where Starmer lived in the 1990s. Police are also investigating a car fire that occurred on the same street as the Kentish Town property; the car is understood to have previously belonged to Starmer.</p>

Coker Sr. was also ordered to serve six months of home confinement after his release, pay a $500,000 fine, and provide up to $644,000 in restitution.

          <p>President Trump is considering accepting a $400 million luxury plane from Qatar as a gift, which he described as ‚Äúa great gesture‚Äù that he would be ‚Äústupid‚Äù to decline. The potential move has drawn criticism, with some labeling it as ‚Äúwildly illegal,‚Äù while others question the ethics of accepting such a lavish gift from a foreign government. The plane, a Boeing jumbo jet, is intended to be refitted and used temporarily as Air Force One, and Trump has suggested it will go to his presidential library after he leaves office. Legal experts are divided on the legality of the gift, citing constitutional clauses and the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs, effectively lifting the trade embargo that had been in place for the past month, according to this New York Times article. The 90-day pause on tariffs is expected to reduce the chances of empty shelves during the holiday season and potentially limit price increases for American consumers, which caused stock prices to surge worldwide. However, the article notes that the agreement does little to alleviate the uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy, as trade policy remains in the hands of one man, and it is not a legally binding treaty ratified by Congress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, remains a sensible strategy even as the economy shows signs of improvement. It argues that while inflation may be easing and the job market appears stable, many Americans still struggle with high-interest credit card debt. The article suggests that for those overwhelmed by their balances, settling for less than what's owed can offer a path out of a seemingly endless debt cycle. However, it also cautions that debt forgiveness comes with trade-offs, such as a hit to one's credit score and potential tax liability on forgiven amounts.</p>

Republicans argue that states should bear more of the financial burden, while Trump aims to offset his tax cuts with budget reductions.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, challenging the policy of linking federal grants to cooperation with immigration enforcement. The states argue that the administration is unlawfully coercing them into adhering to its immigration agenda by threatening to withhold billions of dollars in transportation, counter-terrorism, and emergency preparedness funding. California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the move a ‚Äúblatantly illegal‚Äù threat and argued that the administration is unconstitutionally seizing Congress' power over spending. The lawsuits aim to block the new requirements imposed by the Department of Homeland Security and a letter from the U.S. Transportation Secretary.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times article explores the challenges faced by Dodgers pitching prospect Roki Sasaki, whose fastball velocity has declined since his MLB debut in Japan. Sasaki, known for his triple-digit fastball, has struggled to consistently throw hard, averaging just 96 mph with his four-seamer, sometimes dropping to the 92-93 mph range. The Dodgers' coaching staff is working to identify the root cause of the issue, as Sasaki's fastball relies on elite velocity due to its lack of natural deception. The team is exploring potential mechanical adjustments and pitch conviction issues to help Sasaki regain his fastball speed.</p>

The administration's plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar and the president's family engaging in new overseas business deals are cited as examples. The article also notes the removal of constraints on law enforcement, such as disbanding a Justice Department unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes and suspending enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The author argues that the current moment is remarkable for the openness with which the president and his family are leveraging his position to accrue personal benefits.</p>

          <p>Inflation retreated again in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, but economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, according to this CNBC article. The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April from 12 months earlier, the smallest annual increase since February 2021. However, tariff policies currently in effect could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800 over the short run. Economists are uncertain about the ultimate impact of trade policies, but some suggest tariffs could add as much as 1 percentage point to the consumer price index.</p>
