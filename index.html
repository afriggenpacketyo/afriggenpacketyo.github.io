        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health officials in Wyoming are urgently contacting hundreds of recent visitors to Grand Teton National Park about potential rabies exposure from bat-infested cabins. The alert, spanning 38 states and seven countries, concerns guests who stayed in eight specific cabins at the Jackson Lake Lodge between May and July. While no bats have tested positive for rabies so far, officials are recommending prophylactic treatment for some individuals as a precaution, given that a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed. The cabins have been closed since the discovery, but the rest of the park remains safe for visitors.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor, urging its board to implement significant changes to address chronic underperformance. In a public letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio, and refreshing the board. The firm highlighted Avantor's 50-60% share price decline over recent years and a previously rejected acquisition offer that was well above the current stock value. Engine suggests these reforms could substantially increase shareholder value, or alternatively, the company should consider a sale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a defamation lawsuit by default against blogger Jim Stewartson, who had accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas awarded $250,000 in damages after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court. The judge ruled that Stewartson acted with malice, though noted that Patel's lawyers provided little evidence of specific harm. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to challenge the judgment, calling it an attempt to intimidate his reporting.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm over the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. While not currently projected to make landfall in the continental United States, it is bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to nearby Caribbean islands like St. Martin and St. Barts, prompting flood and landslide warnings. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm will continue to strengthen before taking a sharp turn northeast, potentially passing between the U.S. and Bermuda. As a precaution, FEMA has deployed personnel to Puerto Rico and several seaports have been closed.</p>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. Analysts note that Samsung's wider range of products at various price points also contributes to its success. Apple is expected to respond with its own new designs, including a slimmer iPhone and potentially a foldable model by 2026, intensifying the competition.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all of its operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with the union representing over 10,000 of its flight attendants, who are now on strike. The shutdown is expected to affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily, with the airline operating around 700 flights per day. The Canadian Union of Public Employees and the airline remain far apart on key issues, including pay and compensation for unpaid work. This marks the first strike by Air Canada's flight attendants since 1985, causing significant disruption during the peak summer travel season.</p>

          <p>During a press conference following a summit in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump's claim that the war in Ukraine would not have occurred if Trump had won the 2020 election. Putin stated he was "quite sure that it would indeed be so" and lamented that relations between the U.S. and Russia had fallen to their lowest point since the Cold War before Trump's presidency. He praised Trump's efforts to understand the history of the conflict and expressed hope for rebuilding ties to help end the war.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the American Midwest are grappling with severe financial pressure due to the combined effects of the Trump administration's trade tariffs and the climate crisis. Extreme weather patterns, from drought last year to excessive rain this year, have significantly reduced crop yields for staples like corn and soybeans. Simultaneously, retaliatory tariffs, particularly from China, have caused U.S. agricultural exports to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing domestic prices. This "one-two punch" of lower yields and reduced demand is creating a perfect storm for agricultural communities, despite many farmers continuing to support the administration's policies.</p>

While this strategy aims to leverage their existing name recognition and fundraising ability, it also draws criticism for perpetuating the party's gerontocracy.

Wildlife caregivers at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center are working to save the owl but warn it could take over a year before it can fly again. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the indiscriminate and cruel impact of glue traps on non-target animals.</p>

          <p>A rising number of older Americans are facing homelessness, prompting healthcare organizations like PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) to step in and provide housing solutions. These groups, funded by Medicare and Medicaid, traditionally focus on keeping frail seniors in their homes, but now find they must first secure a home for their clients. The population of homeless individuals aged 55 and older is growing due to rising living costs, lack of economic stability, and unforeseen life events. This "national scandal" is forcing a shift in healthcare, recognizing that stable housing is a fundamental prerequisite for good health.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war with Russia, which Trump distinguished from a mere ceasefire. The announcement came after what Trump described as a "very successful day" with Putin in Alaska, followed by a late-night call with Zelenskyy and European leaders. Trump suggested that if the talks with Zelenskyy are productive, a subsequent meeting with Putin could be scheduled to finalize a deal.</p>

The service, run by trained teenage volunteers, fields thousands of calls, texts, and emails annually from young people struggling with issues like loneliness, relationships, and suicidal thoughts. The program offers a unique space where teens can be heard by peers who understand their contemporary challenges, from social media pressure to school lockdown drills.

          <p>While Russian President Vladimir Putin achieved a symbolic victory at the Alaska summit by securing a high-profile meeting with President Trump without offering a ceasefire in Ukraine, he may be pressing his luck. Trump had set a ceasefire as a key expectation, and his failure to secure one could damage his image, potentially souring his goodwill toward Putin if the war continues unabated. Analysts suggest Putin's strategy is to delay and appease Trump with promises of future talks, buying more time for battlefield gains. The summit ended without a clear breakthrough, leaving the central conflict unresolved and testing the durability of the leaders' relationship.</p>

The plan identifies crucial habitats where the iconic species might survive in a warmer future and outlines strategies like limiting development and reducing wildfire risk.

This sentiment comes as D.C. officials legally challenge the federal takeover, arguing it is an unlawful overreach.

          <p>New research suggests that young chimpanzees primarily learn their complex communication styles, which combine vocalizations with gestures, from their mothers and maternal relatives. By observing a wild chimpanzee community in Uganda, scientists found that related individuals on the mother's side shared similar patterns of vocal-visual combinations, a resemblance not found with their fathers. Since young chimps spend their formative years with their mothers, this indicates the behavior is socially learned rather than purely genetic. The findings suggest that this capacity for social learning in communication is an ancient trait shared with humans, dating back to our last common ancestor.</p>
