            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has expressed strong opposition to President Trump's threat of escalating tariffs, vowing to take countermeasures to protect its rights and interests.  The statement comes after Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs.  China views the U.S. threat as a mistake and insists that it will never accept it.</p>

            <p>Defense stocks in Europe and Asia have outperformed their U.S. counterparts, potentially driven by a lack of trust in the U.S. as an ally.  Countries are increasing their own defense spending due to concerns about the reliability of the U.S., leading to higher stock prices for European and Asian arms manufacturers.  The trend reflects a shift towards autonomous defense policies and a desire to procure weapons from more reliable partners. (not investment advice)</p>
