          <p>The article details the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Jermain Charlo, a Montana woman who went missing in June 2018. Security footage shows Charlo at a bar with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, who provided conflicting accounts of her whereabouts after they left. Cellphone data placed Charlo's phone near DeFrance's residence after he claimed to have dropped her off elsewhere, and he later admitted to discarding her phone in Idaho. Despite extensive searches and investigation, Charlo remains missing, and DeFrance has not been named a suspect. Her family continues to seek justice and closure, hoping for her return to rest with her loved ones.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guardsmen to Los Angeles following clashes between residents and ICE agents conducting raids on undocumented migrants. The unrest occurred in a predominantly Latino district, with tear gas and batons used to disperse crowds, resulting in multiple arrests. The White House claims the raids are essential to halting illegal immigration, while California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned them as cruel and inflammatory. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused ICE of sowing terror, and the FBI and Homeland Security chiefs criticized her comments, stating they endangered federal agents.</p>

Biles had labeled Gaines "truly sick" and suggested she should be "uplifting" transgender athletes, which prompted Gaines to defend her position in a video on social media. Gaines argued that it is not women's responsibility to validate men's feelings and criticized Biles for seemingly body-shaming her. Gaines also highlighted what she sees as a contradiction in Biles' support for transgender athletes while also being a vocal advocate against sexual abuse.</p>

However, many argue that this culture is unsustainable and goes against European values and regulations. Instead, they emphasize the need for more funding, resources, and a focus on innovation and work-life balance to foster a stronger startup ecosystem.</p>

          <p>According to a report in the Washington Post, Donald Trump allegedly referred to Elon Musk as a "big-time drug addict" and expressed disapproval over a physical fight between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The conflict reportedly stemmed from disagreements over government spending and Trump's support for Bessent's choice for acting IRS commissioner. The relationship deteriorated after Trump declined to nominate Jared Isaacman for NASA administrator, leading to Musk's public criticism of the president. The events highlight a significant rift between the two figures.</p>
