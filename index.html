            <h2>New Tariffs Could Hurt Consumers' Wallets, Experts Warn</h2>

            <p>President Trump's newest tariffs are expected to increase prices on everyday items, impacting consumers and potentially worsening economic inequality. Experts warn that low-income families will be disproportionately affected due to spending a larger portion of their income on essential goods. While Trump claims the tariffs will protect American industries, economists suggest they could lead to job losses as businesses struggle with rising costs. Consumers are advised to prepare by stocking up on necessary items, seeking out cheaper alternatives, and carefully evaluating their spending habits. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Apple shares experienced their best day since 1998, surging 15% following President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs that would have affected the company's production in Vietnam, India, and Thailand. The rally added over $400 billion to Apple's market capitalization, although most of its products are still made in China, which was not exempt from tariffs. The reduction in tariffs on Vietnam and India could enable Apple to serve a larger percentage of its U.S. customers from factories outside of China with lower tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Constellation Brands, owner of Modelo and Corona, provided a weaker-than-expected outlook for fiscal 2026 and reduced its medium-term forecast due to higher U.S. tariffs on its beer imports from Mexico. Despite exceeding Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, the company's outlook was negatively impacted by a 25% tariff on imported canned beer and aluminum cans. The company also plans to reposition its portfolio by divesting "mainstream" wines and focusing on premium brands.</p>

The budget resolution, which still faces a final vote, serves as a blueprint for implementing Trump's border security, defense, energy, and tax priorities. The Senate-approved resolution has faced criticism from fiscal hawks for its low level of spending cuts and reliance on a budget scoring method that minimizes the cost of extending the Trump tax cuts.</p>
