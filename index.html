          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is preparing for potential disruptions as President Trump considers imposing higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals.

          <p>Australia is considering capping the number of international students as a measure to address the country's unaffordable housing crisis. This shift marks a significant change for Australia, which once saw international education as a major economic driver. Politicians argue that limiting international students will reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, thereby lowering prices. However, critics argue that international students contribute significantly to the economy and that the focus should be on improving selection criteria rather than implementing blanket bans or limitations.</p>

          <p>A "pocket park" in the central Japan prefecture of Shizuoka has been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the world's smallest, measuring only 0.24 square meter with space for just one person to sit on a wooden seat on a rock.
