            <p>US stock markets saw an increase after the White House announced a rollback of tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones and some other electronics, although President Trump indicated this might be temporary. European markets also climbed, with the UK's FTSE 100 closing up 2.1%. The market's reaction reflects relief after previous historic falls due to Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement on April 2nd. Tech stocks, particularly Apple, experienced gains, suggesting investors are sensitive to trade policy developments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Shares of automakers surged after President Trump indicated a willingness to "help some of the car companies" affected by his 25% auto tariffs. Trump mentioned that automakers need time to shift production to the U.S., suggesting potential relief measures. Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis saw their stocks rise, while other automakers like Toyota and Honda also experienced gains. These comments follow the implementation of automotive tariffs on imported vehicles earlier in April, causing manufacturers to adjust their strategies, with some ceasing U.S. shipments.

            <p>U.S. crude oil prices remained steady after OPEC lowered its demand growth forecast for the year due to President Trump's tariffs. OPEC now projects a demand increase of 1.3 million barrels per day, a decrease from previous estimates. Earlier in the session, oil prices had risen nearly 2% following Trump's decision to exempt key tech products from tariffs on China. Uncertainty remains due to Trump's sweeping tariff plans and OPEC+'s decision to accelerate production, putting downward pressure on prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, during a meeting with President Trump, stated he would not return Kilmar Abrego García, a migrant wrongfully deported from Maryland. Bukele dismissed the idea, echoing the Trump administration's claim that Abrego García is a "terrorist" gang member, a claim not presented in court. The Supreme Court previously ordered the Trump administration to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return, but Trump officials now insist his fate rests with El Salvador.

            <p>China has minimized concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on its exports, stating that the "sky won't fall," while stock markets rallied amid indications of a potential easing of electronics restrictions. Leading tech stocks experienced mixed results due to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's stance on key US imports. Consumers are already feeling the effects of trade tensions, with Sony increasing the price of its PlayStation 5 in certain markets. China has vowed to remain steadfast in the face of Trump's tariffs and is diversifying its trade away from the US.</p>

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argues that Meta's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp has extended its grip on the social media market too far and is seeking to break up the company. Zuckerberg defended the acquisitions, arguing that the apps have grown substantially under Meta's ownership.

He acknowledged the challenges in forecasting and policymaking due to the significant shocks affecting the U.S. economy.

The FTC is using internal emails from Mark Zuckerberg to argue that Meta sought to "neutralize a potential competitor" with the acquisition of Instagram. Meta, in turn, argues that it purchased Instagram and WhatsApp to improve and grow them, and that it is not a monopoly because its services are free and face competition from other apps.
