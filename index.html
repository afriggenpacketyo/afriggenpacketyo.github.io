He emphasized the rapid production of the film to capture the anxieties surrounding technology and AI, aiming for a sense of immediacy. Armstrong also mentioned that directing the film quickly helped alleviate his anxieties about directing for the first time.</p>

          <p>Gap shares plummeted after the retailer announced that new tariffs could cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars. The company anticipates that new 30% duties on imports from China and a 10% levy on imports from most other countries will significantly impact its financials. Gap is planning to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain to reduce its exposure to China, but the full impact remains uncertain. Despite the tariff concerns, Gap's fiscal first-quarter results beat expectations on both earnings per share and revenue. (not investment advice)</p>
