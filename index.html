          <p>In 2025, homeowners can strategically use home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) for financing home projects, taking advantage of affordable price changes, and seeking the cheapest home equity borrowing options. Interest paid on HELOCs is tax-deductible when used for eligible home renovations, making it an attractive option for kitchen or bathroom remodels. HELOCs currently offer lower interest rates compared to home equity loans, cash-out refinances, personal loans, and credit cards. However, homeowners should carefully consider their financial health and ability to manage variable interest rates before pursuing a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is pushing a plan to lower U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, a move experts believe will be difficult to implement. The executive order directs federal agencies to renew efforts to cut prices, aiming to tie U.S. medicine prices to lower international rates. Health policy experts are skeptical about the feasibility of this plan, questioning whether other nations and drugmakers will comply. While the pharmaceutical industry lauded Trump's focus on other nations, they cautioned against importing foreign prices from socialist countries. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to resume collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, with the Treasury Department sending notices to millions of borrowers about upcoming wage garnishments. The Education Department can garnish up to 15% of a borrower's disposable pay, ensuring they retain at least $217.50 per week. Borrowers can challenge the garnishment if they face financial hardship or have recently filed for bankruptcy. Self-employed individuals are less susceptible to wage garnishment, and those in default can explore options like income-driven repayment plans or loan rehabilitation to regain good standing.</p>

It examines how the concept of the closet has transformed over time, from a place of shame and hiding to a more nuanced space with varying degrees of openness.

Despite the reduction, uncertainty remains for U.S. firms, and the two governments have until mid-August to reach a trade deal.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates meeting with Chinese officials again in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations following a 90-day pause on most tariffs. He noted that a "mechanism" is now in place for further talks, and there was a "very long and in-depth sidebar" regarding fentanyl between two officials at the meeting. Under the pause, both countries lowered their baseline tariff rate to 10%, with the U.S. maintaining a 20% fentanyl-related tariff, resulting in a 30% rate on most Chinese goods.</p>

Newsom emphasized that inaction is no longer acceptable, citing the Supreme Court ruling and a 2024 executive order.

The focus on homelessness comes as Newsom approaches the end of his term and amid speculation about his political future.</p>
