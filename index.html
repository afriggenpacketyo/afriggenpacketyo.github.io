          <p>President Trump's new tariffs are causing significant disruption for small and medium-sized tech companies.  Companies like Suvie and Austere, which rely on Asian manufacturing hubs, face drastically increased costs and potential supply chain bottlenecks. The uncertainty created by fluctuating White House rhetoric is exacerbating the situation, leading to volatility in the tech sector and forcing businesses to make difficult decisions about production and pricing. This situation highlights the vulnerability of smaller businesses to large-scale trade policy changes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs are not a strategic move towards future economic development, but rather a nostalgic attempt to revive the manufacturing-heavy economy of the mid-20th century. This approach ignores the fundamental shifts in consumer demand and automation that have made a return to that model unsustainable.  The article argues that focusing on service sectors and addressing issues like wage stagnation and income inequality through modern policies, rather than protectionism, would be more effective in improving working-class living standards. This analysis challenges the underlying assumptions of Trump's trade policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs sparked immediate scrutiny of the methodology used to determine the specific rates applied to various countries. The seemingly arbitrary nature of the tariff rates, with Vietnam facing a 46% tariff while others face significantly lower rates, raised questions about the underlying calculations and their economic rationale. The lack of transparency and the absence of a clear, consistent method for determining these rates have led to widespread criticism from economists and analysts. This highlights the lack of transparency and potential for inconsistency in the administration's trade policy.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the formula used by the Trump administration to calculate its new tariffs, revealing an explicit acknowledgment that tariffs raise prices and reduce demand.  The formula suggests a significant portion of the tariff burden will be passed on to consumers. However, the article points out flaws in the model's assumptions, particularly concerning the proportion of tariffs passed onto consumers and the neglect of broader economic consequences. The analysis highlights the complexity of tariff impacts and questions the accuracy of the administration's predictions.</p>
