          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised a strong response after a missile launched by the Houthi group in Yemen hit near Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's primary international airport. The attack, which injured several people, prompted a temporary suspension of flights and drew condemnation from Israeli officials who vowed to retaliate forcefully against the Iran-backed Houthis. Netanyahu stated that the attacks originated from Iran and that Israel would respond to both the Houthis and Iran at a time and place of its choosing, escalating regional tensions amid ongoing negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. This incident marks a significant security breach, highlighting the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in Israel. Optimism score reflects the danger of further escalation.</p>

          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals, reportedly Lady Gaga fans, in connection with an alleged plot to attack her free concert on Copacabana Beach with improvised explosives. The suspects, linked to an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were apprehended as part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat to the singer's performance. Authorities executed search warrants in multiple cities, but no explosives were found. Lady Gaga's spokesperson stated that the singer and her team were unaware of the operation until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, drawing over two million fans. This news comes as a relief, as the concert was able to proceed without harm.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists to expand its operations in Gaza, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas and secure the release of hostages. This move follows the collapse of ceasefire negotiations and a two-month ceasefire, with Israel stating its intention to operate in new areas and destroy infrastructure. Aid agencies have criticized Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid, alleging it constitutes a war crime, while families of hostages urge the government to prioritize a deal with Hamas.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Damon Linker argues that President Trump's moves to enlarge executive power are not merely an extension of conservative legal theory but are rooted in a more radical tradition of right-wing thought favoring monarchical and dictatorial rule. Drawing on thinkers like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and Adrian Vermeule, Linker suggests that Trump's administration seeks to dismantle the administrative state and consolidate power in the presidency, posing a threat to the nation's constitutional order. The essay highlights the danger of treating a state of emergency as the new normal, potentially transforming the American presidency into a dictatorial office. This article gives context to Trump's actions in office.</p>
