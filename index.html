          <p>A power failure in south-west London caused significant disruptions across the London Underground network, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line. Several lines were suspended, including the Bakerloo, Weaver, and Waterloo & City lines, while others experienced severe delays. Transport for London (TfL) reported that power has been restored, but delays and line suspensions continue as they work to get everything back up and running. Many commuters were left stranded, expressing frustration over their inability to complete their journeys, highlighting the ripple effect of the outage on daily life in London.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. This decision comes after President Trump acknowledged the economic strain caused by the tariffs, leading to a 90-day suspension of further increases and continued negotiations. The article notes that the agreement breaks an impasse that had brought much trade between China and the United States to a halt. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent placed blame on the Biden administration for failing to honor its commitments to the trade deal that Mr. Trump reached with China during his first term. </p>

South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola, said on Monday "there is no persecution of white Afrikaner South Africans", adding that police reports debunk President Trump's assertion. The US has criticised domestic South African policy, accusing the government of seizing land from white farmers without any compensation - something which the southern African nation says has not happened.</p>
