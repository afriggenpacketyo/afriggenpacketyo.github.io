          <p>Campaigners in the UK are urging for cosmetic ingredients to be listed in English, not just Latin, to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. An MP with a severe nut allergy highlighted that few people understand the Latin-based International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system, which lists common allergens like peanut oil as 'Arachis Hypogaea'. While the industry association defends the Latin names for global harmonization, individuals who have suffered reactions argue that cosmetics should adopt clear allergen labeling similar to food packaging for consumer safety.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week in global finance is marked by nervous anticipation as major U.S. banks are set to release their second-quarter earnings.

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in Florida's Panhandle led investigators into the volatile dynamics of a three-person romantic relationship, or "throuple." Seiden was found brutally beaten, and the investigation traced back to a motel room she shared with her boyfriend, Zachary Abell, and his other partner, Christina Araujo. The case, which took nearly six years to go to trial, revealed a history of jealousy, alcohol-fueled violence, and manipulation, culminating in a deadly confrontation during a cross-country road trip.</p>

          <p>Kindergartens across China are struggling with a sharp decline in student enrollment, a direct consequence of the country's plunging birth rate. One government-affiliated kindergarten in Harbin, previously exclusive to officials' children, has been forced to open enrollment to the general public to fill its classrooms. Nationally, the number of kindergartens dropped by over 13% between 2020 and last year, while the number of enrolled children fell by more than 25%, highlighting the profound demographic and economic challenges facing the nation's early education sector.</p>

          <p>Emergency services are searching for two missing people near Barcelona after torrential rains caused severe flooding in Spain's northeastern Catalonia region. The national weather service issued its highest "extreme risk" alert, as heavy downpours blocked roads, flooded a hospital, and caused widespread travel disruption, including the temporary suspension of all regional train services. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has urged caution and deployed a military emergency unit as several regions remain on high alert for dangerous storms.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly supported Attorney General Pam Bondi following backlash from his supporters over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Tensions flared after the DOJ announced it would not release further records and stated a rumored "client list" never existed, a decision that angered many who had been promised bombshell revelations. The fallout reportedly led to a contentious White House meeting between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, revealing deep divisions within the administration over the politically charged case.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, the dismissals were identified through a "weaponization working group" and included individuals in various roles, some not directly involved in prosecutorial decisions. This move has reportedly caused significant concern among career employees at the DOJ, echoing earlier purges during the Trump presidency.</p>

          <p>Hong Wang, a prominent Chinese mathematician and a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has been targeted by online cyber-nationalists for delivering academic lectures in English during a recent tour of Chinese universities. Despite her groundbreaking research and packed seminars at top institutions like Peking University, critics on social media attacked her for not using Mandarin.

          <p>The UK's Health Secretary Wes Streeting is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an attempt to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has announced the walkout from July 25 over an ongoing pay dispute, arguing that a proposed 5.4% increase is insufficient to restore real-terms pay lost since 2008. The government maintains it cannot improve the offer, setting the stage for crucial talks to avoid further disruption to the National Health Service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Hong Kong is well-positioned to contribute significantly to China's rapidly expanding commercial space sector, which is projected to grow into a $1.8 trillion global market by 2035. While mainland China has seen a boom in private aerospace enterprises like i-Space and LandSpace, Hong Kong can leverage its strengths in finance, international law, and research to support this growth. The city can become a vital hub for fundraising, insurance, and talent development, helping to propel China's ambitions in the new space race. (not investment advice)</p>
