          <p>A 19-year-old man from New Jersey has been charged with arson for allegedly starting the Jones Road Wildfire, one of the state's largest in recent history.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has restricted the Trump administration's ability to withhold federal funds from public schools with certain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The judge ruled that the administration's definition of DEI was insufficiently detailed and that the policy could restrict free speech in the classroom while overstepping executive authority. The decision comes after the administration demanded that state education agencies attest that their schools do not use DEI practices that conflict with Trump's interpretation of civil rights law, potentially risking billions in Title I funding.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's handbag, containing $3,000 in cash, was stolen from underneath her chair at a restaurant in downtown Washington D.C.

          <p>Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates warns that President Trump's policies to reshape the global economy could damage the economy and financial assets. The firm expects a policy-induced slowdown and an increased probability of a recession. Bridgewater notes that the changes create exceptional risks to U.S. assets, which are dependent on foreign inflows. The firm also suggests that the economic slowdown and shift away from the U.S. could unwind the conventional wisdom of investing from the past decade.</p>
