          <h2>Supreme Court Unanimously Sides with Gun Manufacturers in Mexico Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of US gun manufacturers, dismissing a lawsuit filed by Mexico. Mexico had argued that these companies contributed to gun violence in Mexico by negligently supplying firearms to traffickers. The court's decision hinged on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which generally shields gunmakers from liability for the misuse of their products by third parties. Justice Kagan's opinion cited the recent Twitter v. Taamneh case, emphasizing that merely providing a good or service does not equate to promoting criminal activity, and that for liability to attach, a merchant must take active steps to promote the resulting crime. The ruling underscores the limitations on holding gun manufacturers accountable for the illegal use of their products in Mexico.</p>

          <p>Key Republican senators are aiming to revise President Trump's budget package, which narrowly passed the House, due to concerns over Medicaid changes, spending cuts, and clean energy tax credits. Senators Collins, Murkowski, and Hawley have voiced worries about Medicaid cuts, while fiscal conservatives like Senators Johnson and Scott are pushing for deeper spending reductions. Disagreements also persist over rolling back clean energy tax credits and increasing the state and local tax deduction cap. These internal divisions within the Republican party could make the bill's passage through the Senate challenging.</p>

However, economists caution that the trade deficit reflects the consumer-driven nature of the U.S. economy. The outlook for Trump's tariff policy remains uncertain, with court rulings and fluctuating consumer attitudes adding to the complexity of the economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, a move that experts say could increase costs on a wide range of consumer goods. The tariffs, which are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, may lead to higher prices for cars, sports equipment, canned goods, household appliances, and homes. While some businesses may absorb the increased costs, economists expect that many will pass them on to consumers. The tariffs could negatively impact both consumer spending and industries that rely heavily on steel and aluminum.</p>

It would also repeal federal excise taxes on gun silencers and tanning services, while reducing or eliminating green energy tax credits.

While the bill includes cost-saving policies, the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Claims that taxes will rise by 68% if the bill does not pass are also misleading, as the bill primarily aims to extend existing tax cuts. While Trump claims the bill only cuts waste and fraud, the CBO estimates over $600 billion in Medicaid cuts, with a significant portion coming from new work requirements.</p>

The court voted 9-0 to reject the suit, upholding a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if weapons they produce are misused. Mexico's government had argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border is a result of "deliberate" practices by US firms that they say appealed to cartel members with their products.
