          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields hover near record highs. Rising Japanese government bond yields could entice Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market downturn. Analysts are divided on the severity of the impact, with some predicting a gradual decline in the carry trade unwind due to eroding confidence in the U.S. dollar, while others foresee a less severe impact due to structural factors and strong U.S.-Japan ties.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship launch reached orbit but experienced a propellant leak, leading to a loss of attitude control and an uncontrolled reentry, likely disintegrating over the Indian Ocean. Despite this "rapid unscheduled disassembly," the launch demonstrated the vehicle's ability to reach orbit, marking an improvement over previous tests. SpaceX aims for Starship to be fully reusable and capable of launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance. The company will review the data from this test to improve Starship's reliability as it seeks to make life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has warned that government pledges on crime will not be met without significant additional funding for policing. He highlighted a decade of underinvestment and increasing pressures on police forces, emphasizing the critical importance of the upcoming spending review. Rowley, along with other chief constables, described the police as overstretched and burdened with debt and outdated technology. Without sufficient investment, he argues, key government promises like restoring neighborhood policing and reducing knife crime will be unattainable.</p>

          <p>A record number of puffins have been recorded on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, with 43,626 birds counted this year. This increase is a "conservation success story" amid rapid global population decline. The island's isolation protects the puffins from predators and human impact. Conservationists believe the thriving population is due to an abundance of food and lack of predators, though the species is still listed as vulnerable to extinction.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is "continuing and permanent," rejecting the White House's attempt to characterize it as temporary. A group of states sued Musk, DOGE, and Trump, alleging that Musk lacked the legal authority to make sweeping changes to the federal government. The judge found that Musk's reach extends throughout the executive branch without known limits and that the states' allegations of unauthorized access to private information were sufficient to move the case forward.</p>

This approach is used amidst a marked change in offending behavior since the COVID pandemic, with offenders making direct contact with children online more than ever before. The unit carries out 700 child sexual abuse investigations a year, taking steps to safeguard hundreds of children.</p>

The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies will be allotted maximum emission allowances, and those exceeding the threshold will need to purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus. While the system aims to lower emissions, companies may pass on the costs to consumers through price hikes.</p>

Mr. Netanyahu has argued that Iran’s vulnerability will not last long, and that the time is right for an attack.

Earlier this month, Ukraine's SBU security service announced the arrest of two Ukrainian citizens accused of spying for Hungary.
