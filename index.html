          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican and prominent supporter of President Trump, has announced his resignation to become the co-deputy director of the FBI. This appointment is part of a significant leadership shuffle at the bureau under Director Kash Patel, which has seen many senior officials depart. During his tenure as attorney general, Bailey was known for initiating numerous lawsuits against the Biden administration on a range of policy issues and for defending Missouri's restrictive abortion laws. Governor Mike Kehoe is expected to name Bailey's successor for the state's top legal office shortly.</p>

          <p>Talks in Washington involving President Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and European leaders concluded without concrete peace commitments but opened pathways for future negotiations. A significant development was Trump's subsequent call to Russian President Putin to arrange a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, which would be followed by a trilateral summit including the U.S. The discussions also saw European leaders push back against Trump's suggestion that a ceasefire is not essential for talks to proceed. Additionally, Trump hinted at providing U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, with Zelenskyy later mentioning a potential $90 billion arms deal as part of this protection.</p>

Market sentiment was also influenced by ongoing talks in Washington between the U.S., Ukraine, and European leaders aimed at resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. While Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight gain after a recent record high, South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both dropped. In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed slightly down, indicating a cautious mood among global investors ahead of potential policy signals from the Fed.

          <p>China's Type 99A main battle tank (MBT) stands out as a critical component of the country's modernized ground forces, integrating advanced technology for enhanced firepower, agility, and survivability. As the latest variant of the Type 99 series, which entered service in 2001, the 55-tonne vehicle features an improved 125mm smoothbore main gun and a larger turret. While China's military focus has often been on its navy and air force, the prominence of the Type 99A underscores the renewed importance of sophisticated land-based systems in modern warfare. Approximately 1,300 units of the Type 99 series have reportedly been produced.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is forecast to move up the U.S. East Coast without making landfall but is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents. The storm strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, as it moved north of the Caribbean. While the storm's center is projected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. coast, officials have issued warnings and evacuation orders for North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of coastal flooding. Forecasters urge the public to heed local warnings and avoid entering the ocean for much of the week.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Nicole Collier of Fort Worth reported being locked inside the Texas Capitol after she returned from a weeks-long walkout over a Republican redistricting plan. She stated that she was confined to her office or the House chambers because she refused to sign a permission slip for a mandatory escort by the Department of Public Safety. The escorts were implemented to ensure that returning Democrats, who had broken quorum by leaving the state, would be present for the upcoming special session. The Texas House Democratic Caucus criticized the police escorts as a tactic by Republicans to monitor and control their political opponents.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed concerns that the artificial intelligence sector may be in an investment bubble, with startup valuations becoming "insane." While cautioning that some investors are likely to get "very burnt," he maintains that the long-term societal value created by AI will be tremendous and justifies aggressive spending on infrastructure. Altman revealed that OpenAI expects to spend trillions on datacenter construction and is already utilizing cloud capacity beyond what any single provider like Microsoft Azure can offer. Despite the bubble concerns, major tech companies continue to increase their capital expenditure guidance to meet surging AI demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>President Trump Announces Plan to Ban Mail-In Voting via Executive Order</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 18:23:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to eliminate mail-in voting and certain voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is being drafted to achieve this. He asserted, without evidence, that these voting methods are corrupt and that states must comply with federal directives on election administration. However, legal experts counter that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to regulate federal elections, giving states primary control over their election processes. Any such executive order would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges and significant logistical hurdles, making its implementation highly unlikely.</p>

          <p>An exclusive report from Kabul reveals that many women are effectively imprisoned in Afghanistan's largest mental health facility, often abandoned by their families and with no possibility of living independently under Taliban rule. The center is severely overcrowded as it faces a surge in patients, reflecting a broader mental health crisis among Afghan women whose rights have been drastically curtailed. Many patients who are medically ready for discharge cannot leave because they have nowhere to go and no male guardian to take them. Their stories highlight a desperate situation where the facility becomes a permanent residence, trapping them in a cycle of institutionalization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One week after President Trump initiated a federal takeover of Washington D.C., the militarization of the capital is increasing, with National Guard troops from several Republican-led states being deployed. The administration has cited a need to combat crime, but the stated mission lacks clear objectives or an end date, raising concerns about an indefinite occupation and its potential as a model for other Democratic-run cities. Federal officers are largely absent from the highest-crime areas, while immigration arrests have risen sharply. This action, legally permissible due to D.C.'s unique status, is viewed by many residents as an intimidating power grab rather than a genuine public safety measure.</p>

          <h2>California Legislature Passes Bill Granting Interest on Insurance Payouts to Homeowners</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed by natural disasters. Previously, when insurers issued checks, lenders would deposit the funds into an escrow account and often keep the accrued interest while rebuilding was underway. The new legislation, which now awaits the governor's signature, guarantees homeowners at least 2% simple interest on these funds. This move aims to close a loophole in state law and provide additional financial support to homeowners during the difficult recovery process.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist at the University of Hong Kong who discovered the SARS coronavirus in 2003, has warned that another global pandemic is inevitable. He expressed concern that the world may not be sufficiently prepared and highlighted respiratory viruses as a primary threat, given the increasing frequency of animal-to-human virus transmission. Peiris emphasized that the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the massive destructive potential of such events on global health, economies, and social stability. He called for greater attention to building a more resilient global system that integrates human, animal, and environmental health to prevent future crises.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to dietitians, adding spinach to pasta is a simple and effective way to combat chronic inflammation, which is linked to numerous health issues like heart disease and diabetes. Spinach is rich in powerful antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, lutein, and zeaxanthin, which neutralize cell-damaging free radicals. It also provides gut-healthy fiber and dietary nitrates that the body converts to nitric oxide, a compound that helps regulate inflammation and relax blood vessels. Due to its mild flavor and versatility, spinach can be easily incorporated into various pasta sauces to boost a meal's nutritional value.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent fired at a moving vehicle in Southern California after the driver allegedly sped away from an immigration stop and struck two agents. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agent fired in self-defense, and no one was hit by the gunfire. However, video taken by a passenger in the car shows agents smashing the vehicle's windows before it drives away, followed by the sound of three shots. The family's advocate says the driver, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was with his U.S. citizen son and son-in-law and called police to report an attack by masked men.</p>

          <p>After breaking quorum for several weeks by leaving the state, Texas House Democrats have returned to the capitol, declaring their effort a victory for raising national awareness about a Republican-led redistricting plan. The lawmakers stated their focus will now shift to building a legal case to challenge the proposed electoral maps, which they argue are discriminatory. Their return allowed the legislature to regain a quorum, and Republicans are expected to move forward with passing the new maps in another special session. The standoff has amplified a national partisan battle over redistricting, with several Democratic-led states now considering their own countermeasures.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes meeting in Washington, President Trump announced he is arranging a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the Kremlin has not confirmed its agreement, stating only that Putin would consider "raising the level" of the current negotiations between the two countries' delegations. The proposal emerged after Trump met with Zelenskyy and six European leaders who urged him to pressure Russia for a ceasefire. While Trump expressed optimism about brokering a deal, Moscow's cautious response indicates that significant diplomatic hurdles remain before any direct leadership talks can occur to resolve the nearly four-year-long war.</p>
