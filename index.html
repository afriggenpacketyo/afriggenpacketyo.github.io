          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, reporting 83 cents per share against an anticipated 50 cents, but revenue fell short at $11.53 billion compared to the expected $11.62 billion. Despite this, overall revenue grew by 14% compared to the previous year, and the company reported a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant turnaround from the previous year's net loss. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi anticipates gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the current quarter, with adjusted EBITDA between $2.02 billion and $2.12 billion. Khosrowshahi also addressed the FTC lawsuit regarding Uber One's billing practices, defending the subscription service's transparency and ease of cancellation.</p>

Khosrowshahi stated that the changes are not related to cost-cutting or planned layoffs, but rather a strategic move to ensure Uber operates at its best as a "Gen-AI powered company." He stated that the company needs to be on its A game, and employees should be more interested in learning and their impact on the company than on its benefits.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the Chavín people of ancient Peru used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to reinforce social hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at Chavín de Huántar containing traces of hallucinogenic substances like DMT and tobacco. These rituals, likely reserved for a select few, may have played a crucial role in the transition from egalitarian societies to stratified ones. By providing access to altered states of consciousness, the ceremonies potentially justified or normalized social, political, and economic inequality.</p>

          <p>Karol G sheds her armor in new Netflix documentary ‘Tomorrow Was Beautiful’, premiering May 8, is a behind-the-scenes look into the making of her “Mañana Será Bonito” tour. Woven into the storyline are the many hurdles Karol had to face as a woman coming up in the male-dominated urban genre known as reggaeton. On-screen, Karol gets personal from the jump, revealing the intense emotional turmoil surrounding her split from Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA in 2021, which helped spur the writing process of her chart-topping 2023 LP, “Mañana Será Bonito,” and set the scene for her 2023 world tour.</p>

          <p>Germany's new coalition government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is reevaluating its approach to climate action, with domestic and international climate policy moving back under the environment ministry. While the government remains committed to climate neutrality by 2045, concerns have been raised about potential conflicts between economic priorities and environmental goals.

          <p>A global resurgence of measles, a highly infectious disease once on the verge of eradication, is raising alarms among health officials. Declining vaccination rates, driven by misinformation and disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to outbreaks in regions across the world, including Yemen, India, Europe, and the United States.

Kessler discusses the transformative potential of GLP-1 anti-obesity medications, while also highlighting the need for caution and comprehensive approaches to weight management. He emphasizes that obesity is a biological issue, not a matter of willpower, and that these drugs can modify addictive brain pathways activated by ultraformulated foods. Kessler calls for more transparent food labeling, dietary guidance for insulin-resistant individuals, and further research on the long-term effects and safe discontinuation of GLP-1s, as well as a food industry revolution.</p>

          <p>Brendan Buck, reflecting on the Republican's current political challenges, argues that congressional Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, are banking on a spending and tax cut package to revive their political fortunes amidst President Trump's economic policies. Buck suggests that the proposed tax cuts, primarily extending the 2017 tax law, may not be enough to counter the economic damage caused by Trump's tariffs. He contends that the party's energy is directed towards passing this bill, which voters may not reward, and that the effort is likely keeping them from putting more pressure on Mr. Trump to stop the tariffs.</p>
