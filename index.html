          <p>General Motors announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, reaffirming its full-year guidance despite economic uncertainty from tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated the company is actively working to mitigate its tariff exposure through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. Despite the positive earnings, the company's net income and revenue saw year-over-year declines, and it is navigating potential impacts on its electric vehicle strategy due to changes in federal tax credits.

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has accused NHS England of endangering patients ahead of a planned strike by resident doctors. The union argues that the directive to minimize cancellations of non-urgent procedures will overstretch senior doctors who are providing cover, potentially leading to last-minute disruptions and patient harm. This new approach contrasts with previous strikes where non-urgent work was widely rescheduled to ensure emergency services remained safely staffed.</p>

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, a 52-year-old unarmed man, has been ruled a homicide by the county medical examiner, who cited heart failure associated with cocaine use and police restraint. His family's lawyers, after viewing unreleased body camera footage, allege an officer knelt on his neck for over three minutes, drawing comparisons to the death of George Floyd. The Irondale Police Department disputes this account, stating no knee was placed on his neck and that officers used necessary force to detain an erratic individual.</p>

          <p>A report details the internal divisions and intense negotiations within the House Republican conference to pass President Trump's signature "megabill." The process involved all-night sessions, last-minute vote changes, and direct negotiations between conservative holdouts and the White House, sometimes bypassing House leadership. The successful passage, secured through a combination of presidential persuasion and backroom deals, highlighted the fragile unity of the GOP majority and the challenges leadership faces in managing its different factions.</p>

          <p>The UK's government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a higher-than-expected figure that adds pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The increase was driven by rising public service spending and soaring debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation-linked debt. Analysts suggest that with persistent growth headwinds and recent reversals on welfare cuts, the government may need to implement tax increases or further spending cuts in the autumn budget to meet its fiscal targets.

The article suggests Nvidia is crucial for bridging current systems with quantum processors, while Alphabet's vast resources and research breakthroughs make it a major player. IonQ is presented as a compelling pure-play company due to its unique "trapped ion" technology, which could offer significant cost and performance advantages over competitors' approaches.

          <p>A European Union policy shift to condition development aid for African nations on their cooperation with migration enforcement is facing strong condemnation. Critics, including policy experts and humanitarian organizations, label the approach as coercive, neo-colonial, and a distortion of development goals. They argue that the policy reduces African nations to the role of border guards and fails to address the root causes of migration, such as conflict, poverty, and the effects of Europe's own trade policies.</p>

          <p>Scientists who monitor the Earth's rotation have noted that recent days have been fractions of a second shorter than the standard 24 hours. This phenomenon is caused by a combination of factors, including the gravitational pull of the moon, movements in the planet's liquid core, and atmospheric winds. While the long-term trend is for days to lengthen, these short-term variations are common and, while intriguing, are of little consequence to daily life, though precise measurements are crucial for technologies like GPS and navigation.</p>

His situation exemplifies the "benefit cliff," where a small pay raise can make a low-income worker ineligible for essential benefits they still cannot afford on their own. The piece uses his personal dilemma to illustrate how new, stricter work and reporting requirements for Medicaid could harm hardworking people who rely on the program to remain healthy and employed.</p>
