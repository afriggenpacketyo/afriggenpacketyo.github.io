          <p>Asian stock markets, including China and Hong Kong, surged significantly on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled potential monetary policy easing next month. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed over 2%, nearing a four-year peak, driven by strong performances in the tech sector, including companies like Baidu and Nio. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended its gains for a fourth consecutive session, reaching a 37-month high. Analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest that maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining market momentum, especially if Fed rate cuts trigger capital rotation from the U.S. to China.

          <p>Shares in wind farm developer Orsted tumbled by approximately 17% on Monday following a U.S. government order to halt construction of a nearly completed project. This unexpected regulatory decision, announced late on Friday, has placed considerable pressure on Orsted's plans to raise capital through a proposed 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue. Despite this significant setback, the company has affirmed its commitment to proceeding with the proposal, noting it has the full support of its majority stakeholder, the Danish state.

          <p>Chinese electric carmaker Nio's Hong Kong-listed shares surged by more than 14% on Monday, extending a remarkable seven-session rally. This impressive gain follows the company's recent unveiling of its latest ES8 SUV model on August 21, priced at a more accessible 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan. This strategic move aims to boost Nio's market share amidst mounting pressure and intense competition within China's electric vehicle sector. The company is also expanding its reach by launching two new, more affordable brands, Onvo and Firefly, to capture a broader range of customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate cooled to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, reaching its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state anticipates slower economic growth later this year. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%, driven by a fall in retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas inflation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects inflation to remain "moderate" in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. This article suggests that the latest inflation reading could strengthen the case for the MAS to consider loosening its monetary policy during its upcoming October meeting.

          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the U.S. dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent dovish remarks. Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole conference indicated a potential interest rate cut in September, significantly boosting market expectations for monetary easing. The yuan's midpoint rate of 7.1161 per U.S. dollar marked its largest upward adjustment since January, with the offshore yuan also strengthening to its highest level since late July. This article suggests that markets have "almost locked in" a Fed rate cut, shifting focus to the future pace of easing and its global economic implications. (not investment advice)</p>
