          <p>President Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, declined to affirm his commitment to Article 5, the core principle of collective defense among NATO countries, citing multiple interpretations of the agreement. When pressed on mutual defense, Trump stated his commitment to saving lives and promised a detailed explanation upon arrival. His ambiguous stance raises concerns among NATO allies regarding the U.S.'s dedication to the alliance's mutual defense pact, especially amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. The president's remarks have added uncertainty to the summit's agenda. Optimism surrounding the future of NATO is uncertain.</p>

Nvidia's stock has surged over 800% since December 2022, driven by high demand for its GPUs in the artificial intelligence sector, and the company reported a 69% annual revenue increase in the first quarter.

          <p>A former Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, alleges that Emil Bove, a DoJ leader and Trump's nominee for a US court of appeals, suggested the department should disregard court orders blocking deportations.

Reuveni states that he witnessed efforts to undermine the courts through dishonesty, delays, and disinformation and that he was terminated for refusing to misrepresent facts in a case.

The Solicitor General argued that Judge Murphy's ruling was a "lawless act of defiance" disrupting the Executive's efforts, leading to a dangerous situation at the military base in Djibouti.

          <p>A court in Nantes ruled that the French government bears partial responsibility for the 2016 death of a jogger who died from inhaling toxic hydrogen sulfide from rotting algae on a beach in Brittany. The court cited the state's negligence in implementing regulations to protect waters from agricultural pollution, which causes algae blooms. The court found the state 60% responsible for the death, awarding compensation to the jogger's family, and marked the first time a French court has recognized the link between a person's death and state negligence in green algae cases. Brittany's intensive agriculture and excessive fertilizer use contribute to the algae problem.</p>
