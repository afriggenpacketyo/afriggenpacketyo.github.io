        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means as the new Surgeon General, replacing his initial choice, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. This decision followed scrutiny regarding Dr. Nesheiwat's qualifications and alignment with Trump's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda. Dr. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, will reportedly work with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in another capacity within the Department of Health and Human Services. The move came after conservative activist Laura Loomer questioned Nesheiwat's ideological alignment with the president, and reports surfaced regarding the accuracy of her resume. The president said Dr. Means has impeccable MAHA credentials.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not consider lowering the United States' 145% tariffs on China in order to facilitate trade negotiations with Beijing. This announcement occurred just days before U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was scheduled to meet with his Chinese counterpart in Switzerland to discuss trade and economic issues. China had previously expressed its firm opposition to Trump's tariff hikes. Trump defended his stance by saying that the U.S. was previously losing a trillion dollars a year, but now it is not losing anything.</p>

          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7th, U.S. travelers are required to present a Real ID or another acceptable form of identification, such as a passport, at airport security checkpoints for domestic flights. Despite initial concerns about potential delays, many airports reported smooth operations on the first day of enforcement, with wait times remaining normal or even lower than usual. The TSA has deployed additional staff to assist travelers and clarify ID requirements. Officials still advise passengers to arrive at least three hours before their flights, especially if they do not yet possess a Real ID, and that people who aren't flying until later in the year can wait to make an appointment.</p>

Airport representatives from Houston, New York City, Philadelphia, Miami, Charlotte, Atlanta, and Boston all reported normal traffic flow and preparedness among travelers. However, former pilot Ryan Tseko predicts massive delays due to public unawareness and expects calls for further implementation delays. Tseko noted that many people, including students, may face significant travel disruptions due to the new requirements.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released its preliminary report on the Hudson River helicopter crash from April that killed six people. The report indicates that the helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 operated by New York Helicopter Tours, broke apart in midair before crashing into the river. Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs before the helicopter disintegrated into three major sections. The NTSB is investigating the cause of the tail boom separation but noted the helicopter lacked video or data recording devices, although the pilot's sunglasses might have recorded audio and video.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes a plan to cut funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which assists low-income seniors, and replace it with "MAHA food boxes" sourced directly from farmers. The USDA suggests these boxes could potentially supplant or complement other USDA programs. Critics express concerns about the logistics of distributing perishable food and whether the boxes will meet seniors' needs, particularly regarding shelf-stable items. The MAHA initiative, championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to promote natural foods and reduce processed ingredients in government food programs.</p>

The officers were involved in a traffic stop in 2023 that resulted in Nichols' death three days later due to blunt-force trauma. The verdict, reached after an emotional nine-day trial, contrasts with the officers' federal convictions for witness tampering and civil rights violations. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump called the verdicts "a devastating miscarriage of justice," while the Shelby County District Attorney expressed disappointment but respect for the jury's decision.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has spent fewer than 14 days at the White House since her husband's inauguration 108 days ago. Her absence from the White House has raised questions, with the lights often off and the shutters closed in the First Lady's traditional corner of the residence. Administration officials claim she is present more than the public knows, but specifics are scarce. Her limited visibility has drawn comparisons to Greta Garbo.</p>

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of Tyre Nichols, a Black man whose beating in 2023 sparked national outrage. The officers, Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean, and Justin Smith, were accused of fatally beating Nichols after a traffic stop. The jury's decision followed an emotional trial and contrasts with the officers' federal convictions for witness tampering. The acquittal has been described as a "devastating miscarriage of justice" by civil rights lawyers.</p>

          <p>The US central bank has warned that President Donald Trump's tariffs have created "so much uncertainty" that it is unsure what to do about interest rates. The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it would keep interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs. But Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economic fallout from Trump's tariffs meant it was "not at all clear" what the bank should do next. Typically, the Fed cuts rates if it believes the economy is struggling and raises them if prices start to rise too quickly.</p>

The system that processes radar data for Newark is actually based in New York. That data is fed over telecommunication lines to Philadelphia, where controllers handle Newark's flights.</p>
