          <p>At least four people were injured in a combined vehicle and stabbing attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, England. The incident occurred as the Jewish community was observing Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism. Greater Manchester Police responded to the scene, where armed officers shot a man believed to be the offender, preventing him from gaining access to the building. The local ambulance service declared a major incident, and counterterrorism officers were also present at the scene.</p>

          <p>The global airline industry is confronting a significant pilot shortage, creating challenges as air travel rebounds post-pandemic. A combination of early retirements during the COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial backlog in pilot training has left airlines scrambling to fill cockpit positions. Experts estimate hundreds of thousands of new pilots will be needed worldwide over the next two decades to meet the rising demand. In response, airlines are increasing pay and benefits, while discussions about raising the mandatory retirement age continue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 06:00:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that the current government shutdown presents a unique opportunity for Democrats to exert leverage over the Republican-led administration. The author argues that because Republicans previously passed a major bill using a process that bypassed Democratic votes, they now require Democratic support to pass a funding bill. This dynamic allows Democrats to demand the restoration of cuts to healthcare programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. The piece suggests that by holding firm, Democrats can highlight the consequences of Republican policies and champion the interests of millions of Americans at risk of losing health insurance.</p>

          <p>This sports analysis examines several key topics in European football, questioning why Manchester United has not yet dismissed manager Ruben Amorim despite a poor record. The club's leadership, who pushed for his appointment, faces a difficult decision as the team continues to struggle. In contrast, Arsenal's recent comeback victory against Newcastle is highlighted as a potentially pivotal moment that could catalyze a serious title challenge. The article also praises American player Christian Pulisic, arguing his current performance level at AC Milan surpasses that of any previous male American player.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is having a direct impact on hundreds of thousands of federal employees and various public services. Many federal workers are furloughed without pay, while those in "essential" roles must work without receiving their paychecks until the shutdown ends. The article highlights that agencies like the EPA and the Department of Education are severely affected, with nearly 90% of their staff furloughed. The shutdown is also expected to worsen the housing crisis by halting much of the work done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert analysis of historical societal crises, from ancient Rome to modern democracies, identifies a recurring mechanism termed the "wealth pump" as a primary driver of instability. This process involves the transfer of wealth from the general population to a small elite, leading to rising economic and political inequality. This dynamic creates widespread popular discontent and an overproduction of elites competing for a fixed number of power positions, a volatile combination that has historically preceded revolutions and civil wars. The article suggests that resolving such crises requires reforms that rebalance wealth and power, such as progressive taxation and strengthening labor rights.</p>

The plan, submitted by London & Valley Water, aims to turn the company around without requiring taxpayer funding.

Additionally, kickers are successfully making longer field goals, with some experts predicting a 70-plus-yarder is possible this season, partly due to teams being able to prepare their own kicking balls.

Under the new rules, which take effect in January, goods will be considered domestically produced if the cost of their Chinese components meets a certain threshold. Importantly, the policy will apply equally to state-owned, private, and foreign-owned firms operating in China, granting them all a 20% price preference over foreign-made goods.

          <h2>Investigation Suggests Utility's Distribution Lines Caused Fires in Altadena Hours Before Main Blaze</h2>

          <p>An NPR investigation into the January Eaton fire in Los Angeles County reveals that Southern California Edison's lower-voltage distribution lines were malfunctioning and started at least one fire in the Altadena neighborhood hours before the main fire, which has been linked to high-power transmission lines. Records show numerous electrical problems were reported in Altadena throughout the day, yet the utility did not implement a widespread power shutoff in the area despite extreme wind conditions. This finding raises questions about whether additional equipment failures contributed to the devastation in a community that suffered nearly all of the fire's fatalities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stubborn inflation and rising living costs are forcing many Americans to change their travel habits, with overall travel prices up 20% since 2019. While luxury travel remains strong, middle- and lower-income families are feeling the squeeze, leading them to scale back vacation plans. Many are opting for shorter, domestic road trips instead of international flights, choosing more affordable destinations, and cutting back on the frequency of their trips. This shift reflects a broader economic pressure where increased expenses for essentials like groceries and housing are leaving less discretionary income for leisure activities like travel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waking up with a sore back or stiff neck can often be attributed to improper sleep posture, which creates gaps between the body and the mattress, causing muscle tension. Medical experts recommend maintaining a neutral spine alignment, similar to standing posture, with ears, shoulders, and hips in a straight line. They advise against stomach sleeping due to neck strain and suggest using pillows to support natural curves, such as under the knees for back sleepers or between the knees for side sleepers. A medium-firm mattress is also recommended to prevent sinking or creating pressure points.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency after its infant mortality rate reached its highest level in over a decade, with nearly 10 babies dying for every 1,000 live births. Health officials and advocates point to a lack of access to prenatal and maternal healthcare as a primary cause, a problem exacerbated by the state's refusal to expand Medicaid. Experts warn that as millions of people nationwide are projected to lose Medicaid coverage due to new federal budget cuts, the crisis seen in Mississippi could be replicated in other states, further worsening the already high U.S. infant mortality rate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current government shutdown is raising concerns that staffing shortages among air traffic controllers could once again disrupt commercial aviation and pressure lawmakers to find a resolution. During the 2019 shutdown, a slight increase in sick leave among controllers caused chaos at major East Coast airports, an event seen as a key factor in ending the 35-day standoff. With controllers now forced to work without pay, morale is reportedly low, and there is speculation that individual controllers may again call in sick, leading to significant flight delays and cancellations across the country.</p>

          <p>As the US government shutdown continues, the White House has escalated its rhetoric by threatening permanent layoffs of federal workers, a departure from the temporary furloughs seen in past shutdowns. Administration officials blame Democrats for the impasse, while Democrats insist on negotiations to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies. While top congressional leaders are not in direct talks, small bipartisan groups of senators have begun informal discussions to find a compromise. Meanwhile, the administration has also moved to cancel or delay infrastructure and green energy projects in states that oppose its policies.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has significantly escalated its drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in recent months, leading to fuel shortages and price increases in some regions of Russia. An analysis reveals that 21 of Russia's 38 large refineries have been hit this year, with a notable surge in strikes during August and September, some targeting facilities deep within Russian territory. The attacks have forced at least 10 refineries to suspend operations, impacting both civilian fuel supplies and military logistics. This strategy is seen by Kyiv as a key means of applying economic pressure on Moscow.</p>
