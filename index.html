        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has extended an order allowing the Trump administration to continue blocking nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign funds, a decision reached by a 6-3 vote. This ruling follows a Justice Department appeal after a lower court deemed the administration's action likely illegal. The administration utilized a pocket rescission, the first in 50 years, asserting that congressional inaction allows the withholding of funds as the budget year concludes before the 45-day approval window. This move aligns with the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, though dissenting justices warned the funds might never reach their intended recipients.</p>

          <p>Famed money manager Howard Rubin and his former assistant, Jennifer Powers, were arrested on charges of sexual assault and trafficking women across state lines for commercial sex acts over a decade. Prosecutors allege Rubin engaged in abusive acts, including using a "sex dungeon" with specialized equipment, and discussed hiring a hitman to target civil suit victims. A federal magistrate judge ordered Rubin detained without bail, citing flight risk and witness intimidation concerns, despite his lawyer's arguments about his health and family ties. Both face a mandatory minimum of 15 years if convicted, with Powers also facing bank fraud charges.</p>

          <p>Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines public schools, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, sparking shock among educators. ICE stated Roberts, born in Guyana, had a final order of removal and no work authorization, and reportedly sped away from officers before his capture. District officials confirmed his detention but could not verify ICE's claims, noting Roberts was granted a license in 2023. Unions praised Roberts as an advocate for students, while the incident has created significant fear within the diverse school community.</p>

          <h2>Comey Indictment Raises Concerns Over Politicization of Justice System</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts view the federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, initiated under President Trump's direction, as an unprecedented test of the American justice system. They suggest the case appears politically motivated, citing Trump's public demands for Comey's prosecution and the replacement of a U.S. attorney who had doubts about the case with a loyalist. Critics argue that Trump's overt use of the Justice Department as a partisan tool threatens the rule of law and could set a dangerous precedent for future political persecutions. Comey denies the charges, expressing confidence in the federal judicial system despite a "broken heart" for the Department of Justice.</p>

Experts like Chris Nowinski emphasize that while CTE involves significant brain changes, it doesn't necessarily cause violent behavior.

While mandatory spending programs like Social Security would continue, administrative services could be disrupted, and key economic data releases might be delayed.

          <p>Two helicopters owned by the Kansas Highway Patrol were observed circling the Kansas Statehouse and downtown Topeka, prompting public inquiry. The KHP confirmed the flights were part of a "photo flight" operation, intended to capture airborne images of their helicopters for publication purposes. The location was specifically chosen to include the downtown Topeka skyline in the visuals. Officials clarified that there was no emergency or active response, assuring the public that the activity was a planned, non-urgent photographic mission.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy has been arrested in Lincolnshire on suspicion of serious injury by dangerous driving, among other charges, following a series of linked hit-and-run incidents. Police believe a black Range Rover was involved in four separate events on Friday, which injured three cyclists and an elderly pedestrian. The incidents occurred across Boston, Maltby Le Marsh, Alford, and Calceby, with the vehicle failing to stop in all cases. Authorities are keeping an open mind but believe the incidents are connected, urging the public not to speculate and to provide any relevant information.</p>

          <p>A 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner, Rafie Ollah Shouhed, is suing the federal government for $50 million, alleging he was violently slammed to the ground and detained for nearly 12 hours during an ICE raid. His attorney claims Shouhed suffered broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury, asserting agents violated his constitutional rights and human decency. This incident occurred amidst the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign in Southern California, which has reportedly swept up other U.S. citizens. DHS stated Shouhed impeded the operation and was arrested for assaulting an officer, though he was released without charges.</p>

          <p>An influx of federal agents from 13 U.S. agencies, alongside 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers, will deploy to Memphis starting next week as part of the Trump administration's crime crackdown. Governor Bill Lee announced the operation, emphasizing the National Guard's support roles without arrest authority unless requested by local law enforcement. Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community questions but stressed using resources effectively to reduce crime. This initiative follows Trump's characterization of Memphis as overwhelmed by violent crime, mirroring deployments in other Democratic-led cities and raising concerns about political targeting.</p>

          <p>Hackers, identifying themselves as Radiant, are threatening to publish more private data and pictures of children from the Kido nursery chain unless a ransom is paid. They have already posted profiles of 20 children and details of dozens of employees online. The breach occurred via a software service called Famly, which insists its security was not compromised and no other customers were affected. Parents have reported receiving threatening calls from the criminals, demanding pressure on Kido to pay. This "barbaric" act has caused immense fear among parents, though authorities urge calm regarding physical harm risks.</p>

          <h2>DOJ Argues Markets Unaffected by Potential Firing of Fed Governor Cook</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 16:26:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has argued to the Supreme Court that President Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged misconduct would not cause "financial market disaster." Solicitor General D. John Sauer urged the court to allow Cook's removal to proceed during her lawsuit against the president, stating Trump suffers "irreparable harm" from lower-court rulings. Cook's attorneys contend her removal would "eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board," risking market chaos. The core dispute centers on whether Trump's "manufactured charges" satisfy the "for cause" requirement for removing Fed governors. (not investment advice)</p>
