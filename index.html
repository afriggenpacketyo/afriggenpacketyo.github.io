          <p>Nicholas Burns, former U.S. ambassador to China, stated that Washington and Beijing are on a "creeping path" toward a trade deal, citing strong economic self-interest for both nations. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Burns offered rare praise for President Trump's tariff strategy, arguing it provides leverage in negotiations. He highlighted the symbiotic economic relationship, with thousands of American companies in China and the U.S. being its largest export market, suggesting logic will guide both sides to an agreement amid an ongoing 90-day trade truce.

          <p>A Seoul court has begun the retrial of Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who was executed for assassinating President Park Chung-hee in 1979. The case revisits a pivotal moment in South Korean history, examining whether Kim's act was a self-serving coup or a patriotic sacrifice to end a dictatorship and foster democracy. Kim's family sought the retrial to clear his name as a traitor, arguing the original military trial was flawed and involved torture. The proceedings are occurring amid contemporary political turmoil, raising questions about the nation's democratic journey.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a group of House Republicans who had initially blocked several cryptocurrency regulation bills have agreed to support the legislation after a meeting at the White House. The bills, including the GENIUS Act which regulates stablecoins, had failed a key procedural vote earlier in the day when 13 Republicans voted with Democrats. Trump's intervention and subsequent post on Truth Social underscore his support for the legislation and his influence over the Republican conference. The reversal is expected to allow the bills to advance for a final vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National League secured a 4-3 victory over the American League in the MLB All-Star Game, which was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time in its history. The game ended in a 6-6 tie after the AL erased a six-run deficit, triggering the new tiebreaker format. Kyle Schwarber of the NL was named MVP after hitting three home runs in the swing-off, leading his team to only its second win in the last twelve All-Star contests. The event also featured the use of a robot umpire system for challenges.</p>

          <p>According to market research firm Rho Motion, global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 24% in June compared to the previous year, reaching 1.8 million units. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in China, which accounted for 60% of the total, and a 23% rise in Europe. In contrast, North American sales experienced a 9% decline, positioning the U.S. as a laggard in the market. For the first half of 2025, global EV sales are up 28%, demonstrating a continued worldwide shift toward electric mobility. (not investment advice)</p>

The TVA board resisted the demand, arguing in a letter that Moul's brief tenure has aligned with Trump's energy goals.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents argue that stablecoins, or "digital dollars," offer a less volatile alternative to other cryptocurrencies and can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions. The legislation would create consumer protections and define legal standards for issuers like banks and credit unions. While major banks are exploring stablecoin integration, concerns remain about market risks, such as a stablecoin depegging from its underlying asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. has initiated a formal investigation into what it calls Brazil's "unfair" trading practices, at the direction of President Trump. The probe will examine Brazil's policies on digital trade, electronic payments, preferential tariffs, and anti-corruption measures to determine if they harm U.S. commerce. This action follows Trump's recent call for Brazil to end the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and a threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated the investigation will address barriers that disadvantage American companies, workers, and innovators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an article published in the Communist Party's main theoretical journal, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's commitment to economic globalization and high-level opening up. The piece, released on the opening day of a major supply chain expo, compiles his statements on the topic since 2012. Xi spoke out against the rise of unilateralism and protectionism, specifically opposing trade barriers, "building walls," and the use of unilateral sanctions. The article positions China as a defender of free trade and multilateralism, contrasting its stance with the more protectionist policies of the United States.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged local governments to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that tailored local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since 2015, more Chinese cities have been granted the authority to draft their own laws on issues like urban development and environmental protection. The article suggests this shift is crucial for adapting to local economic needs.</p>

The comment comes after Bondi and the Justice Department asserted there was no evidence of an Epstein "client list," causing frustration among many in Trump's base who believe in a wider conspiracy. While Trump urged people to move on from the "sordid but boring" case, key allies like Speaker Mike Johnson are publicly calling for more transparency, creating a difficult political position for the president.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from domestic mines instead of on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to acquire the precious metal using local currency, which preserves foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. It is also often cheaper and supports the local mining industry, helping to formalize the sector and divert flows from illegal networks. With gold prices at record highs, this trend reflects a broader strategy by nations to bolster reserves. (not investment advice)</p>
