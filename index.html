          <p>The trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs continued with a judge denying the defense's motion for a mistrial, which stemmed from testimony regarding destroyed evidence in an arson investigation related to the firebombing of Kid Cudi's car. The defense argued that prosecutors were implying Combs interfered with the arson investigation, but the judge dismissed the request, citing that the witness did not answer a question about whether the destruction of fingerprint evidence was unusual. The trial also featured testimony from Deonte Nash, a friend of Cassie Ventura, who claimed to have witnessed Combs physically and verbally abusing Ventura, and that Ventura expressed discomfort about participating in Combs' sex orgies. The trial continues to delve into allegations of sexual assault and racketeering against Combs.</p>

Hoover's attorneys stated that he has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement and expressed their gratitude to President Trump for delivering justice, emphasizing Hoover's rehabilitation efforts.

Prime Minister Netanyahu blamed Iran for the Houthi actions and reiterated Israel's stance of retaliation against those who harm them.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) lowered its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5% due to political uncertainty and the impact of Trump's tariffs. This marks the fourth rate cut in the last six meetings, reflecting concerns about economic growth and stability following the impeachment of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol. The central bank also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%. Despite these challenges, the election of a new president is expected to bring fiscal stimulus and potentially boost consumer spending, although a slump in the property sector and export disruptions could still hinder growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is facing challenges in preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovery from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and potential funding cuts from the Trump administration.

Despite these obstacles, Mayor Karen Bass and Olympics organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman remain confident that the Games will be a success and a boost for the city.

          <p>Analysts predict that trade tensions and global supply chain issues will significantly slow the growth of China's aviation sector. Despite recent tariff cuts, remaining duties on imports from the U.S. could force Chinese buyers of Boeing jets to pay millions more, leading to delivery delays and potential order cancellations. This could limit China's civil aviation passenger capacity growth to an average of 3.1% annually until 2028, a sharp contrast to the 15.4% annual growth rate in the decade leading up to 2019. Some Chinese airlines have already refused to accept Boeing plane deliveries amid the trade upheaval.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing reciprocal tariffs, deeming the action unlawful under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred any future modifications, stating that the tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking did not address the threats outlined in the orders. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, but Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the decision as a victory for working families and small businesses, citing the tariffs' economic devastation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause it imposed on various immigration applications, stating that it was not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S. The ruling is a reprieve for many immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine, and other parts of the world whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. had been threatened. The judge found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in violation of federal administrative law.</p>
