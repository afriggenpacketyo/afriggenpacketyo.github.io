          <p>A North Korean soldier successfully defected to South Korea on Sunday by crossing the heavily fortified land border, as confirmed by South Korea's military. The soldier, who expressed a desire to resettle in the South, marks the first reported defection of its kind since August 2024. This rare and dangerous act highlights the extreme tensions and stringent security along the 248-kilometer Demilitarized Zone, a border guarded by land mines, tank traps, and barbed wire fences, making such crossings exceptionally uncommon. The incident unfolds amidst persistently strained inter-Korean relations, further underscored by North Korea's recent showcase of its nuclear-armed military at a massive parade attended by foreign leaders.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's season has taken a concerning turn under manager Arne Slot, with the team suffering four consecutive losses, their worst run since 2014. A recent 2-1 defeat to Manchester United, where star player Mohamed Salah was notably substituted, highlighted the team's struggles with form, confidence, and defensive organization. Despite a significant transfer outlay of £450m to strengthen the newly crowned champions, new signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak have yet to make a substantial impact, leading to questions about the team's efficiency and tactical coherence. The club now sits fourth in the Premier League, four points behind leaders Arsenal, with Slot facing urgent challenges to reignite his misfiring superstars and address systemic flaws exposed this season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Detroit-area entrepreneur Mark Savaya as Special Envoy to Iraq, publicly acknowledging Savaya's significant role in boosting Muslim American turnout for his campaign in Michigan. Trump praised Savaya's deep understanding of the Iraq-U.S. relationship and regional connections, anticipating these will help advance American interests. This appointment follows Trump's recent signing of a peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which he hailed as achieving "peace in the Middle East" and a step towards ending terror in the region. The administration aims to expand the Abraham Accords, with Savaya's diplomatic role potentially supporting further normalization deals between Israel and Arab/Muslim-majority nations.</p>

          <p>Several thieves, disguised as construction workers, executed a brazen heist at the Louvre museum in Paris on Sunday, stealing at least eight pieces of jewelry, including crowns, necklaces, earrings, and brooches of "inestimable heritage and historical value." The perpetrators used a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor window, then smashed display cases in the Apollo Gallery before fleeing on motorcycles within seven minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron has publicly vowed to recover the stolen items and bring the culprits to justice, emphasizing the attack on national heritage. This sophisticated robbery, targeting items once belonging to Emperor Napoleon and his wife, has prompted a full investigation and raised significant security concerns for French museums.</p>

          <p>A new film, “Diamond Diplomacy,” explores the intertwined history of Japanese and American baseball, using the journeys of four Japanese players, including Shohei Ohtani, to the Major Leagues as its narrative thread. The documentary highlights baseball's role in cultural exchange, from Babe Ruth's 1934 tour of Japan to post-WWII government-funded tours aimed at repairing relations between the two nations. It also touches on the challenges faced by Japanese American players during internment and the eventual integration of Japanese stars into MLB, like Hideo Nomo. Ohtani's current iconic status, with his best-selling jersey and cultural influence, symbolizes the profound impact of Japanese talent on American baseball and the evolution of this cross-cultural relationship.</p>

          <p>The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced a significant test on Sunday after Israel accused Hamas of violating the agreement by shooting at Israeli soldiers, resulting in the deaths of two IDF personnel. In response, Israel launched air and artillery strikes on multiple targets in the Gaza Strip and halted aid transfers "until further notice," threatening to keep the Rafah crossing closed depending on Hamas's cooperation regarding hostage remains. Hamas, however, denied involvement in the reported clashes in Rafah, reaffirming its full commitment to the ceasefire and stating contact with its groups in the "red zones" was cut since March. These escalating tensions occurred as Israel identified two more hostage remains, further complicating efforts to advance the next phases of the peace plan.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a crucial four-run victory over India in Indore, advancing to the World Cup semi-finals with two group games remaining. This win is hailed as the most significant of the Charlotte Edwards/Nat Sciver-Brunt era, demonstrating England's newfound ability to perform under pressure after previous collapses in high-stakes matches. Despite India's formidable partnership and strong batting, England's improved body language and disciplined fielding allowed them to close out a tight match, a notable shift from past tendencies. Captain Heather Knight's sparkling century was pivotal, though concerns remain about the consistency of the middle order. The team now looks ahead to a challenging, unbeaten clash against their greatest rivals, Australia.</p>

This contrasts sharply with Tatar's and Turkey's backing of a two-state policy, which Greek Cypriots have consistently ruled out. The outcome could help revive peace talks on the island, split since 1974, with both Turkish President Erdogan and Greek Cypriot leader Christodoulides congratulating Erhurman, signaling potential for renewed diplomatic engagement.</p>

The aircraft, a Boeing 737 carrying 134 passengers and six crew members, landed safely in Salt Lake City, and passengers were transferred to another flight to Los Angeles.

          <p>The recent, spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum, where professional thieves stole priceless 19th-century jewels, has sparked serious questions about the security of French artworks. The gang's brazen method involved using a mobile platform to enter through a window and fleeing within seven minutes, even dropping a crown during their escape, which was later recovered. This incident, the most significant at the Louvre since the Mona Lisa's disappearance in 1911, highlights a growing trend of criminal gangs targeting valuable, convertible items like jewels rather than world-famous paintings. The theft underscores the vulnerability of French museums, despite a new security plan, as such items can easily be broken apart and sold for considerable sums on the black market.</p>

Professors from the University of Virginia, Arizona, and USC expressed strong concerns, arguing it infringes on academic freedom, free speech, and decentralized decision-making, while questioning the premise of "violence against conservative ideas." Several universities have already rejected the compact, highlighting the clash between federal mandates and institutional autonomy.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde described the global economy as being in "transformation," primarily driven by tariffs reshaping trade maps and the profound impact of artificial intelligence. She noted that while economists might have underestimated the immediate tariff impact, consumers are yet to feel the full pain as businesses absorb squeezed margins. Lagarde highlighted China's leverage in rare earth exports and signs of the U.S. dollar's eroding safe haven status, advocating for international cooperation to counter China's strong trading position. She stressed the importance of geopolitical credibility, rule of law, and strong institutions for a trusted currency. (not investment advice)</p>

This investigation follows Buckingham Palace's announcement that Andrew relinquished his royal titles and honors after emails emerged showing continued contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

He plans to dedicate his life to this cause, having already spoken with President Trump about helping his administration achieve prison reform. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 after a damning ethics report, has stated he is not interested in running for office again for at least a decade, focusing instead on this new advocacy.</p>

While Labour previously pledged to lower average bills by £300 a year by 2030, Miliband emphasized that the long-term solution lies in transitioning to home-grown, clean power to reduce fossil fuel dependence. Scrapping the VAT rate could save average households £86 annually, but would cost the Treasury an estimated £2.5bn per year, with other options like reducing regulatory levies also under consideration.</p>

He stated that at a time when people are "really struggling," the focus should be on the "super wealthy." The party's manifesto proposed an annual tax of 1% on assets above £10m and 2% on assets above £1bn, which Polanski estimates could raise £15bn-£25bn annually. Critics, however, warn such a tax could penalize savings and investment while encouraging wealthy individuals to leave the country. Polanski also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, emphasizing the need to tax unearned wealth and for everyone to contribute to public services.</p>
