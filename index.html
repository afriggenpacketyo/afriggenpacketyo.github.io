            <p>This article explores the possibility of China selling its U.S. mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in retaliation against U.S. trade policies. Such a move could drive up mortgage rates, further weakening the already struggling spring housing market. Experts suggest that this action, combined with the Federal Reserve's reduction of its MBS portfolio, could significantly pressure the market. Rising rates coupled with consumer worries about savings and jobs may further dampen buyer confidence, potentially leading to a more pronounced downturn in the housing sector.

            <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's decision to put on hold planned export controls on Nvidia's H20 AI chip after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a dinner at Mar-a-Lago. The reversal followed Nvidia's promise of new U.S. investments in AI data centers. The H20 chip, while modified to meet export regulations, is still more advanced than many domestically produced Chinese chips, making it valuable for Chinese AI companies. The decision is seen as a major win for China, allowing them to continue importing crucial AI technology. </p>

            <p>This article reports on the decline of pharmaceutical stocks after President Trump reiterated his intention to impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. While pharmaceuticals were initially exempted from broader tariffs, Trump's renewed focus has raised concerns about the impact on the industry. Analysts and companies warn that reshoring pharmaceutical production to the U.S. will be costly, disruptive to supply chains, and could increase drug prices for patients. Some companies have already invested heavily in U.S. manufacturing and are pushing back against the tariffs, citing potential impacts on R&D. (not investment advice)</p>

The co-worker also recalled Heuermann giving her a sweater that his wife had picked up in Iceland, wondering if his wife's absence gave him the opportunity to kill Maureen Brainard-Barnes. The article details the investigation into Heuermann and the impact on his family, including his wife Asa Ellerup, who has filed for divorce.</p>

            <p>Delta Air Lines has pulled its 2025 financial forecast, citing disappointing bookings amid President Trump's trade policies, which CEO Ed Bastian described as "the wrong approach." The airline is not planning to expand flying in the second half of the year. Bastian noted a decline in consumer and corporate confidence. The move signals growing concern among CEOs about the impact of tariffs on consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is taking a more diplomatic approach toward President Trump, emphasizing points of agreement on economic policy. This contrasts with other Democratic governors who have been sharply critical of Trump. Whitmer's approach may reflect the divided political landscape in Michigan. Despite this, she reiterated that she is not signaling a run for president in 2028, though her speech is unlikely to quiet the speculation.</p>

Its computer systems will constantly compare new images to previous ones, allowing the observatory to detect anything that changes. If it exists, this observatory has a good chance of finding it.</p>
