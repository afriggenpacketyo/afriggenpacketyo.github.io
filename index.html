          <p>A Los Angeles judge has agreed to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents. The ruling opens the possibility of parole for the brothers, who claim they acted in self-defense after years of abuse. Prosecutors argue the brothers meticulously planned the killings to gain access to their parents' fortune and have not taken responsibility for their actions. The case has remained a topic of public interest, spawning books, documentaries, and dramas, with opinions divided on whether the brothers should be released after three decades in prison.</p>

          <p>José Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, has died at the age of 89; he served from 2010 to 2015 and was known for his humble lifestyle and progressive policies. A former guerrilla fighter, Mujica refused to live in the presidential estate, opting instead for his rural farm, and donated most of his salary to housing projects. During his presidency, Uruguay legalized abortion, gay marriage, and marijuana, earning him international recognition. Mujica's political career began in the Tupamaro urban guerrilla movement, leading to over a decade in prison before transitioning to mainstream politics and ultimately the presidency.</p>

          <p>Jillian Shriner, wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, pleaded not guilty to charges of discharging a firearm with gross negligence and assault with a semiautomatic firearm following a shooting incident in Eagle Rock. The incident occurred when police were pursuing hit-and-run suspects and encountered Shriner armed with a handgun in a neighboring yard. Police claim she pointed the gun in their direction after being ordered to drop it, leading officers to open fire, striking her in the shoulder. Shriner told police she was defending her home from the suspects running through the neighborhood; she is currently out on $1 million bail and is due back in court in June.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of obstructing a federal agency and concealing a person to help them avoid arrest. The charges stem from an incident where Dugan allegedly hid a previously deported illegal immigrant in her jury room to prevent his arrest by ICE agents. The indictment follows testimony that included statements from the immigrant's attorney and Dugan's court clerk, and Dugan is expected to enter a plea at a hearing on May 15.

          <p>A forthcoming book titled “Original Sin” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson details concerns about former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s mental and physical decline while in office. The book recounts instances where Biden forgot names of longtime aides and allies and appeared frail in meetings, leading to aides wrapping him in a protective political cocoon. Despite these concerns, the book notes that few Biden allies were willing to speak openly about his decline, even after his defeat. The authors suggest that powerful figures in the Democratic Party either misjudged the situation or declined to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington’s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The proposal was made to an American special envoy during talks in Oman, aiming to establish a three-country consortium where Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade for civilian use in other Arab countries. This plan differs from the 2015 nuclear agreement by including on-the-ground presence of representatives from other countries for oversight and would be a permanent agreement. President Trump has stated he wants to make a deal with Iran to make the region safer.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has warned that the government is abolishing NHS England without a clear plan for how it will be achieved or how it will benefit frontline care. Ministers announced in March that the body responsible for overseeing the health service in England would be dissolved, with its functions integrated into the Department of Health and Social Care. The Public Accounts Committee has expressed concern about the uncertainty caused by this move and urged the government to provide a detailed plan within three months. The government maintains that the changes will eliminate wasteful duplication and that detailed planning has commenced.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's Office claims that President Trump’s tariff policies will reduce state revenues by $16 billion through next year. Despite higher-than-expected personal income and corporate tax receipts through April, the administration projects lower overall revenues due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Newsom is seeking to blame the president for California’s expected revenue shortfall, releasing this information ahead of the presentation of his revised 2025-26 state budget plan. The state also plans to seek a preliminary injunction to freeze the tariffs in federal court.</p>

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly vowed he wouldn't allow Medicaid to be cut, but House Republicans' bill to fund his agenda aims to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the program that provides health care for poor, elderly and disabled Americans. For several months, Trump has promised not to touch the program, though on Monday he urged Republicans to "UNIFY" around the "one, big beautiful bill," which plans to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements for recipients, make more frequent eligibility checks, and penalize states like New York and California that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter to Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie that the proposal met its lofty target for $880 billion of savings over the next decade. The health portions would save about $715 billion, according to CBO. However, at least 8.6 million more Americans will go uninsured.</p>
