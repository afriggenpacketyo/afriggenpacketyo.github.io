          <p>This article details an Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, where officials report at least 15 fatalities, including four journalists from international news agencies. The Israeli military confirmed the operation, stating an investigation is underway and denying any intentional targeting of journalists. Eyewitness accounts and video footage depict a chaotic scene with a doctor showing bloodied clothing and a second explosion occurring as rescuers responded. This incident underscores the severe risks faced by civilians and media personnel in the region, coming after a similar strike near al-Shifa Hospital that drew strong condemnation from the UN. The escalating conflict continues to pose significant humanitarian challenges.</p>

          <p>A new report by CREA and GEM reveals China burned coal at record levels in the first seven months of 2025, the highest since 2016, despite concurrently undertaking a massive expansion in renewable energy. The nation added 21 gigawatts of coal power and projects 80-100 GW total this year, fueled by powerful coal interests. This paradoxical trend occurs as China also installs unprecedented renewable capacity, leading to a slight emissions drop, yet it threatens to derail President Xi Jinping's long-term climate pledges and overall environmental progress. The report highlights a complex energy landscape.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial in South Africa has yielded promising results in the quest for an HIV cure, with one young woman potentially in long-term remission after more than two years off treatment. This landmark study, part of the FRESH program, used a "kick and kill" strategy involving a drug to flush out the virus and broadly neutralizing antibodies tailored for the dominant African HIV strain. While not a complete success for all participants, achieving long-term viral control in 20% of the women offers significant hope and valuable insights for future, more scalable curative therapies, particularly for the populations most affected in Africa.</p>

This acquisition, which includes a 33% premium for JDE Peet's shareholders, is projected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following the deal's closure, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies. This strategic move aims to enhance market appeal and streamline operations, signaling a significant restructuring for the North American beverage giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public health expert Jessica Knurick has gained significant traction on social media, using platforms like Instagram and TikTok to debunk claims from the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, led by US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Knurick, a dietitian with a PhD, argues that while MAHA identifies genuine concerns about chronic disease and a profit-driven healthcare system, its proposed causes and solutions are often misleading and anti-science. She aims to re-educate an audience susceptible to fear-based messaging, particularly mothers, by focusing on evidence-based public health principles and exposing financial conflicts within the wellness industry.</p>

While analysts believe the economy has absorbed most of the impact, with a narrowing drag on GDP, the housing market correction continues. Beijing is implementing measures to boost demand and stabilize the sector, but consolidation around state-backed developers appears inevitable as homebuyers increasingly favor state-owned entities and completed properties.

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has accused President Donald Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify sending federalized National Guard troops into Chicago, bypassing local leaders. The Pentagon confirmed planning is underway for such a deployment, which typically requires a state governor's request or a national emergency. This move comes as the Trump administration also plans to mobilize National Guard in 19 mostly Republican states for anti-immigration crackdowns. Critics argue this represents an overreach of federal power, politicizing law enforcement and undermining local governance.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the societal acceptance of tackle football for boys, contrasting it with the growing popularity of flag football for girls, often justified by concerns over violence and danger. The author argues that if tackle football is deemed too dangerous for girls, its inherent risks, including CTE and Parkinson's disease, should also be critically examined for boys. The piece highlights how the sport perpetuates narrow forms of masculinity and disproportionately affects working-class men of color. It suggests that, rather than asking why girls don't play tackle football, we should question why boys still do, advocating for a shift towards safer alternatives.</p>

Under Polish consumer protection law, companies cannot unilaterally alter essential contract terms like pricing without active subscriber approval. UOKiK argues Netflix's reliance on a lack of response as agreement is insufficient, and has initiated administrative proceedings. If the allegations are confirmed, Netflix could face a fine of up to 10% of its turnover per unlawful clause and may be required to reimburse customers, mirroring a previous UOKiK intervention with Amazon.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent independence day greetings to Ukraine, a message posted by President Zelensky, emphasizing steady bilateral relations and cooperation over 33 years. Xi expressed readiness to guide long-term development for mutual benefit. This gesture comes amidst international scrutiny of China's increasing closeness with Russia since the invasion, despite Beijing's insistence on neutrality in the conflict. Zelensky appreciated the congratulations, highlighting mutual interest in a long-term dialogue based on mutual respect for peace, stability, and prosperity.

          <p>A special election for Iowa State Senate District 1 pits far-right Republican Christopher Prosch, known for controversial views on abortion and conspiracy theories, against Democrat Catelin Drey, a marketing executive focused on affordability and gun violence. A victory for Drey would break the Republican supermajority, offering Democrats hope for a "blue wave" in the 2026 midterms. The race highlights the increasing extremism in state legislatures and the Democratic Party's efforts to reconnect with working-class voters on economic issues, challenging the perception of being out of touch. This election is seen as a crucial test of political momentum.</p>

While US Customs and Border Protection denies political targeting, critics argue searches are more targeted and politically motivated.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's rhetoric on crime, arguing he effectively exploits the public's fear despite declining crime rates in most major US cities. While official statistics show violent crime at decades-low levels in places like Washington D.C. and Chicago, national surveys indicate a 30-year high in fear of crime. The author suggests Democrats err by merely citing statistics, as fear is driven by gruesome news coverage, social media, and a general sense of disorder. Trump's strategy, exemplified by his National Guard deployments, taps into this potent emotion, making it a critical issue for Democrats to address beyond data alone.</p>

          <p>A new study by UC Berkeley economists reveals that America's richest individuals, including those on the Forbes 400, pay an average tax rate of just 24%, significantly lower than official estimates and many middle-class professionals. This disparity is attributed to sophisticated wealth-management strategies, deductions, and loopholes in the tax code, allowing billionaires to shelter fortunes and make profitable businesses appear to operate at a loss. The article notes that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act, both under Donald Trump, have further reduced tax rates for the wealthy, shifting the burden onto lower-income Americans.

          <p>New research suggests that fish, often considered simple-minded, may experience pleasure and actively seek it out, challenging conventional views on their mental complexity. Scientists studied bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, observing that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been cleaned. Experiments involving opioid mimics and blockers indicated that the pleasure derived from this "massage" is mediated by natural opioids in their brains. This groundbreaking study suggests a distinction between "liking" and "wanting" in fish, potentially prompting a reevaluation of how fish are treated in aquariums and aquaculture, and offering deeper insights into the ancient function of positive emotions in animal evolution.</p>
