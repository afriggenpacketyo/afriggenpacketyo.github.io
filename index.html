          <p>Audrey Backeberg, who disappeared from her family's home in Wisconsin in 1962 at the age of 20, has been found alive and well, according to the Sauk County Sheriff’s Office. The investigation revealed that Backeberg's disappearance was her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play. The family's babysitter reported that Audrey hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin, before taking a Greyhound bus to Indianapolis, Indiana. The Charley Project indicates Audrey's marriage was troubled with allegations of abuse, and her family insisted she would never have abandoned her children.</p>

          <p>Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers claims President Trump is attempting to force universities to "bend the knee" through pressure tactics, including freezing grants and questioning their tax-exempt status. Summers argues that Trump's actions constitute extortion, as he believes the president is not genuinely trying to reform Harvard but rather break it. The Trump administration asserts it is standing up for students whose civil rights are being trampled by left-wing universities. Summers also expressed anxiety about Trump's economic policies, suggesting they could tip the economy into recession.</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I" will be an additional proclamation and not a full replacement of Veterans Day. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." According to the Congressional Research Service, establishing a federal holiday or a patriotic observance requires the passage of a law.

He also said that military action against Canada to make it the "51st state" is "highly unlikely." Trump acknowledged the U.S. economy is in a "transition period" and pushed back against recession forecasts, deflecting blame for the first quarter's economic decline. He played down talk of seeking a third term in the White House, despite previous suggestions to the contrary.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's aides discussed the possibility of him taking a cognitive test in February 2024 amid concerns about his mental acuity as he geared up for re-election. The aides ultimately decided against the idea, fearing it would raise further questions about his mental abilities. Biden eventually stepped down from his re-election campaign in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump. Harris then lost the presidential election to Trump, ushering in the former reality TV star's second term.</p>

          <p>The San Pedro Bay port complex in Los Angeles is experiencing a slowdown due to the Trump administration's tariffs on imports, affecting approximately a third of the port's traffic. This is expected to impact waterfront communities and the broader Southern California economy, with potential consequences for warehouse workers, truck drivers, and logistics teams. Experts predict that the front-loaded stock retailers built up before the tariffs will only last a few weeks.

          <p>The Los Angeles Innocence Project (LAIP) has announced new evidence in the Scott Peterson murder case, claiming it "eviscerates" the prosecution's theory and proves Peterson's innocence. The LAIP argues that critical exculpatory evidence was suppressed and destroyed before the trial, violating Peterson's rights to due process and a fair trial. The new evidence includes information about a burglary across the street from the Petersons' home, new witness statements, and revised fetal growth research. The LAIP's investigation has been met with skepticism, but also interest in re-examining the case.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the concept of "soft eugenics" within the MAGA movement, focusing on policies that deprioritize healthcare and social services for vulnerable populations, while promoting procreation among the perceived "strong." Figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are criticized for emphasizing personal responsibility over systemic issues, and for downplaying the role of healthcare. Elon Musk's focus on IQ and promoting childbirth among "smart" people is also highlighted. The article argues that these policies, including cuts to international aid and social services, reflect a belief that only the strong should survive, leading to a disregard for the lives of the vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile strike on Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport, resulting in injuries and temporary halting of flights. The missile evaded interception efforts, prompting an investigation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Health experts express concern that these cuts will hinder the ability to understand and address public health issues.

          <p>The Trump administration has cut more than $800 million in research grants focused on LGBTQ health, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. The cuts are justified by the administration as a move away from ideological bias and unscientific premises, with concerns about diversity programs and gender-affirming care. Critics argue that the cuts effectively create a hierarchy of patients and undermine efforts to address health disparities in the LGBTQ community. This action is part of a broader dismantling of medical research infrastructure, with concerns about the legality and consequences of these terminations.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as vice president signaled a shift in his administration from a coalition government to a royal court. The author suggests that Vance's selection, over more moderate candidates, demonstrated Trump's preference for loyalists and enforcers who would not challenge his decisions. The shift towards a more disinhibited and reckless presidency is attributed to the lack of checks and balances previously provided by a more diverse staff and a less sycophantic Republican Party.</p>
