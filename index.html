          <p>Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, has officially launched its eye-scanning ID project in the United States, opening six retail locations. The project aims to create a global identity verification system using iris scans and blockchain technology to combat fraud and bots. Users who get their irises scanned by an Orb receive free cryptocurrency and can use their World ID as a sign-in for integrated platforms. Visa will introduce the "World Visa card" exclusively for iris-scanned individuals, and Match Group will pilot World ID for age verification on Tinder in Japan.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal that grants Washington preferential access to Kyiv's natural resources in exchange for the creation of a reconstruction investment fund. This agreement, pursued by President Trump, aims to facilitate Ukraine's economic recovery and signal commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Russia. Treasury Secretary Bessent emphasized that this partnership demonstrates a long-term commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine, while preventing those who supported Russia's war efforts from benefiting from Ukraine's reconstruction. The deal is viewed as compensation for U.S. aid to Ukraine during the war.</p>

          <p>In her first major address since leaving office, Kamala Harris delivered a sharp critique of President Trump's initial 100 days, accusing him of a "wholesale abandonment of America's highest ideals." Speaking in San Francisco, Harris praised leaders and institutions resisting Trump's agenda, urging Americans to organize and defend fundamental rights. She argued that Trump is intentionally sowing fear to consolidate executive power and warned of a potential constitutional crisis. Harris, who is considering a run for California governor or another presidential bid, framed Trump's actions as a deliberate plan to undermine American democracy.</p>

Despite these revisions, the BOJ maintained its benchmark interest rate, signaling its commitment to raising rates further if economic conditions align with its expectations.

          <p>European auto giants are reporting a sharp decline in first-quarter profits, and many have suspended or cut full-year financial guidance, citing the impact of President Trump's trade tariffs. Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz have withdrawn their financial outlooks due to tariff-related uncertainties, while Volkswagen expects its operating return on sales and net cash flow to be at the lower end of forecasts. Volvo Cars has also ditched its financial guidance, announcing cost-cutting plans in response to tariff pressures. These actions reflect the significant disruption and uncertainty caused by Trump's trade policies on the global automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a teenager who was promoted from Chelsea's academy team to the first team, has achieved this feat without being loaned out. Despite initial doubts about his chances among the club's expensive talent, George impressed head coach Enzo Maresca during pre-season, securing his place in the squad. His estimated transfer value has significantly increased, and his early development was supported by personal coaching and training with older players, contributing to his fearlessness and technical skills. This highlights the importance of youth development and individual training in nurturing young talent.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israeli reservists, including former Mossad head Danny Yatom, have signed letters urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to halt the war in Gaza and prioritize a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas. These reservists, including long-time critics and those who previously supported the war's objectives, express concerns about the country's direction and the government's priorities. With reports indicating declining reserve attendance, this opposition represents a looming crisis for the Israeli military, reminiscent of the first Lebanon war in 1982.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Glasgow University have confirmed the rising presence of mosquitoes in Scotland, with sightings as far north as Shetland. The country is now home to over 20 different species of the biting insect, thanks to a successful citizen science project. Researchers received numerous reports from the public about nuisance biting, initially suspected to be midges, but analysis revealed the presence of mosquitoes actively biting people. The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas and even in urban settings, with larvae found in stagnant water sources.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk argue that the United States military, while possessing advanced equipment, lacks the necessary personnel and materiel to fight a major war. They contend that decades of prioritizing high-tech weapons over sheer volume have left the military ill-prepared for prolonged conflicts. The authors point to the war in Ukraine and recent operations against the Houthis as examples of modern warfare's demands, urging increased investment in active service members, ammunition, new ships, and new aircraft to address the growing threats posed by China, Russia, and other adversaries.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits.

The central bank also decided to maintain its current interest rate policy, complicating its efforts to normalize monetary policy.
