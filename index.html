          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, indicating a preference for policy stability amidst global economic uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed lower, reversing previous gains. Meanwhile, Taiwan's Taiex also saw a significant drop, and Indian benchmarks Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex showed modest gains. Representatives for Gautam Adani reportedly engaged in talks with former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration officials regarding the dismissal of bribery charges. Optimism in the market is moderate, considering the mixed performance across Asian markets and the potential implications of political continuity.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump addressed judicial nominations and immigration policies, threatening tariffs on all movies produced abroad. Trump stated that the U.S. needs judges who will not demand trials for every illegal immigrant, citing the burden on the justice system due to mass illegal immigration. He claimed his overhaul of U.S. immigration policies was his No. 1 campaign issue, blaming radicalized judges for delaying the process. Trump's comments reflect a continued focus on immigration and judicial appointments as key priorities.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has pledged to support its film industry following Donald Trump's threat of imposing 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the U.S. Trump described foreign film incentives as a national security threat. Australia, known as "Hollywood Down Under," relies heavily on foreign film productions, supported by a 30% rebate for big-budget projects. The potential tariffs could undermine the attractiveness of these incentives, sending shockwaves through the global film industry.</p>

Simion has expressed concerns about the war and resentment towards financial support for Ukrainian refugees, though he denies being pro-Russian.</p>

          <p>General Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan's army chief, has taken a more prominent role in shaping the country's response to escalating tensions with India over Kashmir following a deadly terrorist attack. General Munir's tough rhetoric, including framing Kashmir as Pakistan's "jugular vein," reflects his hard-line views and the need to project strength amid domestic political and economic challenges. The United States and the United Nations have called for de-escalation, but India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to pursue terrorists and their backers.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has ordered the reopening and expansion of Alcatraz prison, citing the need to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. The maximum security facility, closed in 1963, would serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice," according to Trump. Leading Democrats have criticized the proposal as not serious, noting the high costs associated with operating the island prison. Experts suggest that the federal prison system already has available beds and the need for a new prison is unclear.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced he would impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing national security concerns. Trump has authorized the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of taxing any and all movies coming into the country that are produced in foreign lands. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment. The proposed tariff raises questions about its scope and potential impact on the film industry, including independent films and movies receiving tax incentives from foreign countries.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the familiar saying "roses are red." The study, published in Nature Plants, analyzed domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor probably had single-petal flowers with yellow color. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' have been cultivated in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, becoming a symbol of love and beauty.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to or surpassing the United States in key technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence. They highlight China's ability to quickly develop and disseminate state-of-the-art technology, as well as its manufacturing prowess. The authors contend that the U.S. must adapt and innovate to maintain its competitive edge in the face of China's growing technological capabilities. The essay suggests that America needs to openly share more of its A.I. technologies and research, innovate even faster and double down on diffusing A.I. throughout the economy.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey indicates that visitors to Japan are most frustrated by the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations. Many respondents reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks. The lack of public trash bins has led to increased littering in tourist spots.</p>

          <h2>China Faces Deflation Risk as US-Bound Exports Divert to Domestic Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 23:35:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market due to high tariffs killing U.S. orders for Chinese goods. Local governments and major businesses are supporting this effort, but it threatens to drive the country into deeper deflation. An influx of discounted goods intended for the U.S. market would erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment. The consumer price index has already slipped into negative territory, and the producer price index has fallen for consecutive months.</p>
