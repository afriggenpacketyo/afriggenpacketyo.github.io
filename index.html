          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner carrying 242 passengers and crew crashed in Ahmedabad, India, shortly after departing for London's Gatwick Airport. Initial reports indicated no survivors, but later sources confirmed one survivor was found and hospitalized, while also fearing casualties on the ground as the plane crashed into buildings. Air India CEO Campbell Wilson stated that investigations were underway and the airline was sending a support team to Ahmedabad to assist passengers, crew, and their families. The incident marked the first crash of its kind for the 787-8 Dreamliner, prompting investigations from both Indian and U.S. authorities and widespread condolences from global leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>An Air India flight AI171, bound for London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing at least 204 people and injuring 41. The plane crashed in a residential area, striking a doctors' hostel, and initial reports indicated no survivors, though one British national was later found alive. Flight data showed the aircraft lost signal less than a minute after takeoff, reaching a maximum altitude of 625 feet. Air India has suspended operations at Ahmedabad airport and Tata Group, the airline's owner, will provide compensation to the families of the deceased, as authorities investigate the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>A new LendingTree study reveals that Americans spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips in 2023, with tipping rates varying significantly by state. New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of spending on food away from home, while Utah residents tip the least, at 4.09%. The study also indicates that higher tipping rates correlate with states where people dine out more frequently, with Washington D.C. residents spending the most on dining out, at $10,291 per capita in 2023, and the East Coast generally exhibiting higher tipping rates than the South and Western U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and urging him to cut interest rates. Trump claimed that lowering rates by two percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion per year, but Powell has not acted. This attack follows similar comments from other administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice President JD Vance, who have also pressured the Fed to lower rates. Despite Trump's remarks, markets remained largely unmoved, with traders pricing in little chance of a rate cut in the near term, though expectations for a September cut have slightly increased.

          <p>The U.S. dollar fell to a three-year low due to President Trump's renewed tariff threats and a weakening economy, prompting speculation of earlier interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Analysts cited weak jobs data and uncertain White House policies as factors diminishing the dollar's appeal, while trade talks between the U.S. and India faced challenges over tariffs and market access. The UK is expected to benefit from a bilateral trade deal with the U.S., though concerns about the UK economy tempered the pound's rise, and economists suggest the dollar's depreciation reflects doubts about the U.S. economy's exceptional growth under Trump.

Jurors expressed disappointment, citing a single juror's unwillingness to change his mind on the rape charge, while Mann stated that sexual assault can occur in relationships where power and manipulation are present, and the prosecution said she is ready for a third trial.</p>

          <p>NASA and Axiom Space have indefinitely delayed the launch of the Axiom-4 commercial flight to the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns about a persistent air leak in a Russian compartment. The leak, located in the PrK, a passageway in the Zvezda module, was first detected in 2019, and although cosmonauts have attempted to seal it, air continues to escape. The delay allows NASA and Roscosmos additional time to evaluate the situation and determine if further troubleshooting is necessary, with the hatch to the PrK closed during daily operations as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>Medical debt financing companies are offering services to struggling rural hospitals, as potential healthcare cuts could leave millions without insurance. These companies act as middlemen between hospitals and patients, helping hospitals get paid by "subprime patients." Curae, a company that finds money from various sources, charges hospitals a fee for its services and facilitates financing to patients, including payment plans and interest-bearing loans. Critics raise concerns about whether hospitals are directing patients who qualify for charity care into these financial products, and although some hospitals find the services enticing, potential patient complaints and fees remain a concern.</p>

          <p>The Army is reviewing the sale of pro-President Donald Trump merchandise at Fort Bragg during an event commemorating the Army's 250th birthday. The presence of "Make America Great Again" hats and other political items is under scrutiny for potentially violating Defense Department policy, which prohibits troops from expressing political opinions in uniform. The event, orchestrated by the White House and Trump's supporters, included soldiers nodding and cheering at Trump's remarks, with some booing references to Democratic leaders, raising concerns about the apolitical nature of the military.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley testified again in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, driven by a desire to stand up for the truth after a court overturned his previous conviction. She recounted the 2006 sexual assault in detail, leading to Weinstein being found guilty of sexually assaulting her, but acquitted of assaulting another woman, and a mistrial declared on a third rape count. Haley expressed hope that the verdict signals a new awareness around sexual violence and the fading of the perfect victim myth, emphasizing the importance of holding Weinstein accountable for his actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs would drive inflation higher, recent data has not shown significant price increases. Factors such as companies stockpiling imported goods, the time it takes for tariffs to impact the economy, and limited pricing power have kept inflation in check. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months, as the effects of pre-tariff stockpiling diminish and higher import costs begin to affect consumer prices.

          <p>An unexpected surge in Social Security retirement claims occurred between January and May, nearly 18% higher than the same period last year, raising concerns about the financial implications for individuals. The Social Security Administration cited retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change increasing benefits for some with pensions, and a bump in people re-filing for higher benefits as key reasons. Additionally, worries about the economic future under the Trump administration are prompting some individuals in their 60s to claim benefits early, fearing potential changes to the system and a desire to secure benefits while they are available.

The survey, conducted by AlixPartners, found that executives anticipate tariffs on goods from Vietnam to remain at 10% rather than the feared 46% level. The optimism stems from recent trade negotiations with China and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs, although some caution that the situation remains uncertain, particularly for countries without China's leverage.

          <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, announced it will impose fines starting at €500 on passengers whose disruptive behavior leads to their removal from a flight, hoping to deter such behavior. The airline said that disruptions were caused by a small number of unruly passengers, and the airline has amended its terms and conditions to allow fines to be "taken directly from the card used to make the booking." The airline also stated it will continue to pursue civil damages for compensation for the costs incurred in more serious cases.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to attend the UN General Assembly in September despite an invitation from President Donald Trump, with China instead sending Premier Li Qiang to represent the country. The bilateral relationship has seemingly improved following a phone call between Xi and Trump, but logistical challenges and months of preparation needed for such trips make a September visit improbable. Observers believe a visit would significantly stabilize one of the most critical bilateral relationships in the world.</p>
