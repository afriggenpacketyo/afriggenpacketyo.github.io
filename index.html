          <p>Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders but criticism from Jewish environmental activists who argue his policies weaken environmental protections, conflicting with the Jewish value of repairing the world (tikkun olam). Zeldin defended his policies as based on law and science, separate from religious interpretations, while others argued that smart regulations can align with Jewish values of protecting both the environment and the economy. The ceremony included the inscription of Hebrew passages related to the environment into a new Torah, highlighting the diverse interpretations of Judaism's stance on environmental stewardship. The article emphasizes the tension between religious observance and environmental responsibility in the context of political action.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to 80% from the current 145% as U.S. and Chinese negotiators are set to meet in Switzerland for trade discussions. While Trump stated that this reduction depends on concessions from China, White House officials clarified that he would not unilaterally lower tariffs. Experts warn that an 80% tariff may still be too high to revive trade, as many companies find tariffs above 50% crippling, and economists have cautioned that Trump's tariffs are increasing the risk of a recession. The article provides insight into the ongoing trade tensions and potential implications for businesses and the global economy.</p>

          <p>Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson, in his first meeting with agency personnel, warned against "obfuscation, delay, undermining," threatening to "run right over" anyone attempting to subvert his agenda. Richardson emphasized his commitment to fulfilling President Trump's intent to reduce the agency's scope, referencing his military service and promising to push responsibilities down to the state level. He was appointed after the previous administrator was fired for disagreeing with the administration's plan to eliminate FEMA, and he has instructed staff to provide internal memos assessing FEMA's preparedness for 2025, reflecting his determination to reshape the agency.

          <p>South Africa has criticized the United States' plan to potentially accept white Afrikaners as refugees, deeming the move "politically motivated" and an undermining of South Africa's democracy. The South African government said it would not block departures but sought assurances of vetting and no pending criminal charges, also refuting allegations of discrimination against white minorities and targeting in farm violence. The US State Department stated they are prioritizing Afrikaners facing racial discrimination, but did not confirm resettlement timing, also accusing South Africa of land seizures without compensation, which Pretoria denies.

          <p>A California law that expanded the number of child sexual assault lawsuits against public institutions has led to a wave of litigation, pushing cities, counties, and school districts to the brink of financial crisis. The law, Assembly Bill 218, lifted the age limit for filing childhood sexual assault lawsuits and opened a three-year window for claims that had expired under the old statute of limitations. This has resulted in multimillion-dollar judgments and settlements, with some communities facing potential bankruptcy as they struggle to pay for past abuses, while balancing the need to provide current public services.

The plaintiffs, represented by a conservative think tank, claim that Biden abused the Antiquities Act, which mandates monuments be limited to the “smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.” Supporters of the monument, however, argue that the law has long been used to protect large land masses and that Chuckwalla safeguards land sacred to tribes, important wildlife habitat, and military sites.

          <p>A small group of Republicans is threatening to derail President Trump’s fiscal agenda over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, creating a potential political standoff. These lawmakers, representing high-tax states, insist on lifting the $10,000 limit imposed in 2017, while many Republicans oppose dedicating significant resources to what they see as a handout to rich residents of blue states. Attempts to reach a compromise have yielded little progress, leaving the issue unresolved as Republicans prepare to release their tax bill. The article examines the divisions within the Republican party over the SALT deduction and the potential consequences for Trump's legislative agenda.</p>
