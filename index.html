          <p>Protests erupted in Makassar, Indonesia, following the death of a motorcycle taxi driver who was struck by a police vehicle. Demonstrators, angered by the incident, set fire to a local council building, resulting in the deaths of three people trapped inside. The unrest, which also saw clashes in the capital Jakarta, presents a significant challenge for President Prabowo Subianto's new administration, which is already facing public discontent over budget cuts and populist policies. The president has promised a full investigation into the driver's death.</p>

          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, ending a difficult contract stalemate. The Packers acquired Parsons in exchange for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark, subsequently signing him to a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons expressed his excitement about joining the historic franchise and aiming to build a legacy similar to Packers legends. The move provides Green Bay with a much-needed elite pass rusher.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Manchester United's performance under manager Ruben Amorim points to systemic issues with his rigid 5-2-3 positional gameplan. The team has struggled to adapt when opponents, like Grimsby Town, use man-to-man marking, which neutralizes Amorim's strategy of creating numerical overloads in wide areas. The system relies heavily on specific passing patterns, such as the 'up-back-through,' but lacks the individual dribbling and creative freedom needed to break down disciplined defenses. This tactical inflexibility is highlighted as a key reason for the team's inconsistent results despite significant summer spending.</p>

          <p>North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volume more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. The isolated nation purchased over 157,000 liters, making it the second-largest market for Chinese bottled wine by volume, just behind Hong Kong. Despite extensive international sanctions on luxury goods, alcohol is not on the United Nations' banned list for North Korea. This trade highlights China's continued economic relationship with its ally, which has few other options for sourcing such products.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has asserted that Russia's frozen assets within the bloc will not be returned until Moscow pays reparations for the war in Ukraine. This statement comes amid ongoing debate within the EU on how to handle the approximately €210 billion in frozen Russian funds. While countries like Ukraine and Poland advocate for confiscating the assets to support Kyiv, major EU members such as France and Germany have raised legal concerns about such a move. The focus is now shifting towards how these funds might be utilized after the conflict ends.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has changed its regulations to allow men under the age of 22 to travel abroad, a move aimed at providing them with opportunities for education and work while maintaining ties to their home country. Previously, men aged 18 to 60 were barred from leaving due to potential military conscription, although the draft has primarily targeted those over 25. The policy shift addresses fears that an entire generation might be lost as young men were leaving before turning 18 and not returning. However, some demographic experts worry the change will accelerate youth emigration rather than encourage returns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from expanding its use of "expedited removal" for undocumented migrants detained within the interior of the United States. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's ruling addresses the administration's policy of quickly deporting migrants who have been in the country for less than two years without a court hearing. The judge argued that applying this statute broadly to people living inside the country, away from the border, must include due process protections. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's aggressive deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired a Department of Justice paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making an obscene gesture and using vulgar language towards National Guard members in Washington, D.C. The termination followed an investigation into incidents where Baxter reportedly boasted about her actions. This dismissal is part of a stated commitment by the DOJ to uphold respect for law enforcement amid a heightened federal presence in the city, which was deployed by President Trump to address crime.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Finds Many of President Trump's Tariffs to be Unlawful</h2>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that many of the widespread tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal emergency economic laws. The decision is a significant challenge to the administration's trade strategy, which has utilized the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the duties. While the court upheld that the tariffs were illegal, it has sent the case back to a lower court to reconsider if a universal block on them is appropriate. The Trump administration has vowed to appeal the ruling, which will not take immediate effect.</p>
