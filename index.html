The country approved 93 new drugs in 2024, the highest in five years, and holds 70% of global medical device patent applications. The NDRC also launched an "insights system" to streamline R&D and market processes, aiming to overcome bottlenecks in drug innovation.

          <p>European stock markets opened higher, with the regional Stoxx 600 index gaining 0.25%, as investors await a crucial US jobs report. Market sentiment improved after Thursday's US payrolls data increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, now at a 99% probability. In the UK, July retail sales surpassed forecasts, and house prices saw a slight rise in August, indicating some economic momentum. However, Danish wind farm developer Orsted's shares fell after it lowered its full-year earnings guidance due to low wind speeds and ongoing US project obstructions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' predictions, attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) had delayed these figures due to data quality concerns, revising past year's data for accuracy. Despite the monthly rise, sales over the three months to July were down 0.6%. Experts caution that these positive factors are temporary, and retailers still face significant new costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations weather agency report states that wildfires significantly contributed to air pollution in the past year, a trend expected to worsen with climate change. The World Meteorological Organization's bulletin emphasized the impact of tiny particles (PM 2.5) from fires in the Amazon, Canada, and Siberia, which can travel across continents and degrade air quality. While some regions like Eastern China showed improvements due to reduction efforts, ambient air pollution remains a cause of 4.5 million premature deaths annually. This article underscores the global health and environmental consequences of increasing wildfire activity.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden recently underwent Mohs surgery for skin cancer, as confirmed by his spokeswoman. This procedure is a common and effective method to remove cancerous skin tissue until no evidence of the disease remains. Biden, 82, has a history of skin cancer, having had a cancerous lesion removed in 2023, and was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that spread to his bones in May. Since leaving the White House in January, he has largely retreated from the public eye, with his family continuing their strong advocacy for cancer research and awareness.</p>

          <p>A growing number of millennials and Gen Z entrepreneurs are acquiring small businesses through "search funds," an investment vehicle that allows individuals to raise capital to buy and operate existing companies. This trend addresses a looming succession crisis as many baby boomer business owners prepare for retirement without clear plans. Search funds offer a lower-risk path to entrepreneurship, with strong historical returns (35.1% IRR). Investors often provide mentorship, capital, and strategic guidance, helping new CEOs navigate challenges like the fraud encountered by one entrepreneur. (not investment advice)</p>

Radakin commended the UK's decisive response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, characterizing the war as a "disaster" for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order renaming the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," a move he asserts will project a stronger image of "readiness and resolve" for the nation's military. This proposed change would revert the department to its historical name, used until 1947. While the President cannot legally change the department's official name without congressional assent, the order will authorize the use of "secondary titles" and instruct the Defense Secretary to recommend necessary legislative actions for a permanent alteration.

          <p>President Donald Trump's controversial plan to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War" is being widely criticized as a "new high—or low" in political performance art.

The article further highlights that even major global powers like China and Russia utilize "Ministry of Defense," suggesting that Trump's proposed alteration is primarily about cultivating a tough-guy image rather than reflecting strategic reality.
