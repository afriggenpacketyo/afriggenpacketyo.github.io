          <p>Leaders from Germany and France have expressed strong reservations about the new trade deal reached between the EU and the U.S. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the agreement would "substantially damage" his country's finances, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called it an act of "submission." The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. in exchange for Europe buying more American energy. While many EU capitals acknowledged it was necessary to avert a worse trade war, the overall reaction across the bloc has been downbeat.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal between the United States and the European Union is projected to have significant economic consequences, according to market experts. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, which could reduce the EU's annual GDP by 0.2%, while U.S. exports to the EU will remain tariff-free. While the deal averts a potential trade war with even higher tariffs, economists describe it as unbalanced, with the EU also committing to large purchases of U.S. energy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article posits that the Trump administration is attempting to distract from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal by promoting claims of an Obama-era plot to fabricate Russia's 2016 election interference. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard recently claimed to have "irrefutable evidence" of this plot, a narrative Trump has long pushed. The author argues this is a multi-layered dishonest strategy, designed to shift focus while reinforcing the false claim that Russia did not intervene to help Trump. The piece contends that public evidence and bipartisan reports have already confirmed Russia's pro-Trump interference.</p>
