          <p>Israel launched airstrikes near the Syrian presidential palace in Damascus, citing a need to protect the Druze minority from sectarian violence.  The strikes followed days of clashes between Sunni extremists, government forces, and Druze militias. This action marks an escalation of Israel's involvement in the Syrian conflict, as it previously intervened militarily earlier in the week. The Druze community in Israel is pushing for continued intervention.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government postponed legislation to criminalize misogyny and ban conversion therapy.  The delay is attributed to time constraints and the need to consider recent Supreme Court rulings on gender definition.  The government plans to amend existing hate crime legislation to include sex as a protected characteristic.  LGBTQIA+ organizations expressed disappointment over the delay of the conversion therapy ban.</p>
