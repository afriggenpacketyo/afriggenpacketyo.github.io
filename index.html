          <p>NASA and SpaceX postponed the launch of the Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station due to unfavorable weather conditions at the Kennedy Space Center. The crew includes astronauts who were rescheduled from a previous flight because of issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule, which required their seats for a return trip. The mission's commander, Zena Cardman, expressed that spaceflight is a team effort and she is grateful for the journey despite the unexpected changes. This flight will use the Crew Dragon Endeavour, marking a record sixth flight for the capsule as SpaceX works toward certifying its vehicles for up to 15 missions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 90-day extension of the current tariff rates on Mexican goods, postponing a threatened increase to allow for further trade negotiations. President Trump confirmed the decision after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, stating the deal maintains a 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars, and a 50% tariff on metals. The article notes that this extension highlights the lack of a broader trade agreement between the U.S. and its largest trading partner. The goal is to sign a new trade deal within the 90-day period.

The article highlights that Black women are significantly less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than white women.

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, is publicly urging the Trump administration not to grant any form of leniency to Ghislaine Maxwell. Their statement follows President Trump's remarks that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago resort. The family expressed concern over Maxwell's recent bid for immunity in exchange for testimony, arguing that the convicted sex trafficker should not be trusted or rewarded. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is appealing her conviction.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the phenomenon of impostor syndrome, where high-achieving individuals secretly feel like frauds despite their genuine accomplishments. Citing the example of author John Steinbeck, it explains that this feeling is common among professionals in technical fields and those in positions of trust, such as doctors. The article suggests that while some believe it can motivate improvement, it often leads to burnout and anxiety. To combat these feelings, it recommends practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of growth, and building a supportive peer community.</p>

          <p>A 20-minute "radar-related issue" at the UK's national air traffic control center in Swanwick caused significant flight chaos, leading to 150 cancellations and ongoing delays. NATS, the UK's air traffic service, stated the problem was resolved by switching to a backup system and that it was unrelated to a major outage in 2023. However, airlines have criticized NATS for the second major failure in two years. An expert explained that when a primary system like radar fails, the network's capacity is severely reduced for safety, causing a major backlog even after a quick fix.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled draft proposals to fine large companies that persistently fail to pay their suppliers on time, in a bid to support small businesses. Under the plans, the small business commissioner would gain the power to issue fines, and invoice payment terms would be limited to a maximum of 60 days. The government claims late payments, estimated to total £26 billion at any given time, are a primary issue for small firms and contribute to thousands of business failures annually. The proposals will now undergo a 12-week consultation period before any legislation is introduced.</p>

Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, held steady at an annual rate of 2.8%. The report helps explain the central bank's recent decision to hold interest rates steady as it assesses the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

The article in The Atlantic argues that the show's creators pivoted from direct political commentary to using Trump's persona to address corporate issues, such as Paramount's cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." By embedding their industry-focused criticism within a provocative, Trump-centric storyline, the creators managed to make their point accessible to a broad audience and generate widespread discussion about corporate influence.</p>

          <p>A new study has revealed a surprising origin for the potato, suggesting its lineage began 8 to 9 million years ago from the hybridization of an ancient tomato and a flowering plant from the Etuberosum group. Researchers found that this improbable union created a new plant that, unlike its parents, could form tubers—the nutrient-storage organs we eat as potatoes. This unique ability allowed the proto-potato to thrive in new, harsher environments and diversify into over 100 species. The discovery reframes hybridization not as an evolutionary dead end but as a powerful force for creating novel traits.</p>
