          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 19:51:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering allowing Iran to continue low-level uranium enrichment for an unspecified period as part of a proposed nuclear deal. According to Axios, the proposal includes restrictions such as preventing Iran from building new enrichment facilities, requiring the dismantling of critical infrastructure, and halting research and development on nuclear centrifuges. Iran would be allowed to participate in a regional enrichment consortium for civilian purposes and reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% while shutting down underground facilities for an agreed-upon time period. The proposal also seeks to develop auditing and oversight mechanisms to ensure Iran's compliance with the agreement.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pardoned two shark divers from South Florida, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline in 2022. The divers, who believed the line was illegal, were charged with theft after officials said it belonged to a licensed fisherman. Despite avoiding prison time, the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms, and traveling freely. The pardons erase these convictions, with attorneys for the divers stating that the case should never have been filed.</p>

          <p>NPR is collecting submissions from parents who sing to their babies, aiming to discover which songs are most effective in calming or cheering up infants. This initiative follows a Yale University study indicating that singing to babies improves their moods and overall well-being. The study found that babies who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day, not just during singing sessions. NPR encourages parents to upload recordings of themselves singing to their babies, which may be featured on Morning Edition.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC cautioned investors to "be ready for disappointment" as the White House continues to influence market action. Cramer suggested that the administration is willing to disappoint the stock market to advance its agenda, citing changing trade relations between the U.S. and China as an example. He noted that stocks have been shaped by notions of trade relations, and broader fears are pushing certain stocks down, mentioning government contractors and U.S. companies with suppliers abroad as examples. Cramer advised that recognizing the President's control over the stock market is essential to understanding market behavior.</p>

          <p>The head of FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, leading to confusion and concern among staff. The U.S. hurricane season officially runs from June to November, with NOAA forecasting as many as 10 hurricanes this year. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security claimed the comment was a joke and that FEMA is prepared for hurricane season. Richardson's comments have amplified worries that staff cuts and reductions in hurricane preparations will leave the agency ill-prepared for the upcoming storm season.</p>

The decline has led to increased vulnerability to measles outbreaks, with the largest outbreak occurring in West Texas.
