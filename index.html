        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India and Russia have agreed to deepen bilateral trade ties, particularly in the hydrocarbon sector, signaling their intent to defy U.S. tariff pressures from the Trump administration. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar highlighted the enduring strength of their relationship, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed commitments to joint energy projects. This partnership persists despite Western sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine war, with India arguing it was asked by the U.S. to stabilize markets. Geopolitical experts suggest Trump's tariff threats are primarily a leverage tactic to secure trade deals and influence a Ukraine ceasefire, rather than solely curbing Russian oil revenues.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chocolate prices are projected to increase due to a lagged impact from soaring cocoa costs, driven by adverse weather and supply tightness in West Africa. Cocoa futures, though recently easing, remain historically high, and this won't immediately translate to lower retail prices. Experts from J.P. Morgan and Capital Economics anticipate sustained high prices, also citing productivity challenges in major cocoa-producing nations and rising business costs in the U.K. and potential U.S. tariffs. However, the outlook for 2026's Easter season may improve as industrial demand softens and supply gradually recovers, though prices are expected to remain structurally elevated.

          <p>The U.S. and China are intensifying their space race, particularly concerning lunar exploration, with both nations aiming to land humans on the Moon by the end of the decade. China has made significant advancements, including successful tests of its Lanyue lunar lander and Long March-10 rocket, reiterating its goal for cosmonauts on the Moon before 2030. This challenges NASA's Artemis program, which targets a similar timeframe around 2027, despite the U.S. having a historical advantage. However, questions linger over NASA's chosen lunar landers, while Chinese commercial space players are also growing, leading some experts to believe China could reach the Moon first.</p>

While mission specifics remain confidential, Space Force and Boeing officials disclosed two payloads: one testing high-speed laser communications for proliferated space networks and another evaluating a quantum navigation sensor for GPS-denied environments. The X-37B, resembling a mini space shuttle, serves as a testbed for advanced avionics and reusable spacecraft components, with its orbital duration remaining undisclosed.</p>

Kallas criticized Putin's perceived gains from recent U.S. talks, suggesting he is not genuinely interested in peace but in increasing aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy echoed this skepticism, accusing Russia of avoiding necessary meetings and urging Western allies to clarify security commitments amid ongoing attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Millions of travelers across the UK are bracing for significant traffic congestion and train disruptions this bank holiday weekend. A strike by the RMT union on the CrossCountry network will severely impact services from Friday to Monday, with no direct trains on Saturday. The RAC also predicts heavy road traffic, especially on the M5. Network Rail advises passengers to check journeys due to both strikes and engineering works. Despite the travel woes, the weather forecast for central and southern England anticipates warm, largely dry, and sunny conditions, offering a pleasant backdrop for those who successfully reach their destinations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, ordering Florida to halt further expansion and begin winding down operations at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Everglades. Judge Kathleen Williams ruled that the facility, which holds several hundred detainees, causes irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem and violates environmental laws. The order prohibits new construction and the transfer of additional detainees, requiring removal of temporary structures within 60 days. Florida officials have appealed the decision, arguing the state-run facility is exempt from federal environmental laws, a stance the judge rejected, noting the decades-long efforts to preserve the Everglades.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This mechanism offers valuable insights into optimizing linalool release to combat pests and potentially increase crop yields. The research, published in Science, involved field surveys in Hainan province, China, revealing that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also showed reduced growth. This finding highlights a sophisticated form of plant-to-plant interaction, opening new avenues for agricultural innovation and pest management strategies.</p>

Economists expect Powell to subtly affirm the likelihood of a rate cut while carefully framing policy strategy and inflation control. The Fed is also expected to retool its "flexible average inflation targeting" framework, potentially reverting to a more preemptive stance on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Facebook group named "Mia Moglie" (My Wife), with 32,000 members, was removed after men were found sharing non-consensual intimate images of women online, sparking widespread anger in Italy. Meta, Facebook's parent company, shut down the group for violating its "Adult Sexual Exploitation policies." Screenshots revealed photos of women in various states of undress, often taken secretly, accompanied by sexually explicit and violent comments. The discovery has prompted concerns about the prevalence of such groups and a call for stronger action against this "virtual sexual assault," which was criminalized as revenge porn in Italy in 2019.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized President Trump, accusing him of attempting to "rig the election" and implement authoritarian policies, including deploying federal agents and the National Guard. Newsom defended California's proposed partisan redistricting plan, which favors Democrats, as a necessary counterweight to Trump's actions and efforts to control Congress. The ballot measure, Proposition 50, seeks to discard independent commission-drawn congressional boundaries to potentially remove Republican representatives. Republicans, including NRCC Chair Richard Hudson, accuse Newsom of trying to "rig" the system for his own political ambitions, framing the debate as a national struggle over election integrity and democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement rangers have dismantled a 13-acre illegal marijuana cultivation site in Sequoia National Park, revealing severe environmental degradation. The farm, operated by "well-organized drug-trafficking organizations," had diverted creeks, poisoned soil with banned pesticides like methamidophos, and left thousands of pounds of waste. Crews removed nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash, noting terraces cut into hillsides, illegal trails, and evidence of poaching. This bust highlights the ongoing battle against such operations in national parks, which threaten biodiverse havens and can contaminate water sources, despite decades of efforts to eradicate them.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. Judge Matthew Brann disqualified Habba from all ongoing criminal cases by her office, stating her appointment by the Trump administration through "a novel series of legal and personnel moves" was invalid since July 1, 2025. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced an immediate appeal, vowing to protect Habba's position from "activist judicial attacks." This decision, which is stayed pending appeal, stems from challenges to the legality of her interim appointment after a deadline expired.</p>
