          <p>An administration official stated that President Trump is allowing a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran, despite skepticism about Iran's willingness to negotiate. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have been in contact, though no meetings are planned. The official cited heavy losses among Iran's senior leadership and nuclear policy experts as a reason for this breathing room. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is wary of negotiating with Iran, but the US-Israel relationship doesn't guarantee leverage over the Trump administration. The situation remains tense as European diplomats prepare for talks with Araghchi in Geneva, with some US officials doubting their effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a â‚¬1.35 billion capital raise led by the French state. This capital increase, along with debt refinancing, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights. Eutelsat uses rockets from companies like SpaceX to deploy satellites into LEO and geostationary orbit, and following a deal with OneWeb in 2023, became the world's third-largest satellite operator.</p>

          <p>Chris Brown pleaded not guilty to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm after allegedly assaulting a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.

          <p>China's Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has warned against the growing "addiction" to blind boxes and card packs among young people. The newspaper called for stricter identity verification to curb minors' "out-of-control consumption" of these items, which contain randomly chosen toys or cards. The allure of "unknown surprises" in these opaque packages can lead to impulsive spending and "commercial traps." This warning echoes regulations enacted to prevent online gaming addiction among teenagers, as the purchase of blind boxes carries an element of gambling due to the unpredictable rewards and rarity levels used to attract consumers.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, a UK airbase, and sprayed two military planes with red paint, causing a security breach. Palestine Action claimed responsibility, stating they evaded security and rendered the air-to-air refuelling tankers "out of service", though the RAF assesses the damage and doesn't expect operational impacts. Prime Minister Starmer condemned the action as "disgraceful", and the Ministry of Defence is reviewing security at UK military bases. Thames Valley Police are investigating the incident, which involved the use of repurposed fire extinguishers and crowbars to cause damage, and the incident raises concerns about national security.</p>

Government borrowing also hit the second-highest level for May since 1993, reaching Â£17.7bn.

          <p>The author argues against a potential U.S. military intervention in Iran, drawing parallels to the Iraq War. The author contends that attacking Iran would be a mistake, even if Iran were developing nuclear weapons, as it would incentivize them to use them. The author asserts that Israel attacked Iran to preempt American diplomacy, and a new nuclear deal would have stabilized the region. The author suggests that the U.S. should step back from the brink and prioritize American well-being over the hatred of distant demons.</p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully developed and tested artillery-launched drones capable of withstanding the immense forces within a 155mm cannon shell. After 12 years of overcoming technical challenges, five live-fire trials confirmed the drones could endure forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight. The advance centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism that separates the drone from its artillery shell mid-flight without electronic controls. These drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, multiply flight range, significantly save power consumption, and extend loiter time.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the annual reports of the Social Security and Medicare trustees, highlighting the potential threats to these programs under the Trump administration. It criticizes Republican politicians for misrepresenting the reports and for failing to address the leading threats to the programs. The author argues that Trump's immigration, taxation, and tariff policies are weakening Social Security's financial footing, while Republican healthcare proposals jeopardize access to medical care. The article emphasizes the need to increase revenues by eliminating the cap on wages and taxing investment income.</p>

          <p>The union representing workers at a UC Davis lab that tests for bird flu infections has sued the university, seeking records on staffing levels and lab operations. Workers raised concerns about short staffing and testing procedures as avian flu spread through poultry and cattle. The union alleges that UC Davis has refused to release the records, violating California's public records laws. The Davis lab is the only entity in the state authorized to confirm bird flu cases, and the union hopes the records will reveal how staffing levels are affecting farms and businesses that rely on the lab for testing.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is facing a budget crisis exacerbated by skyrocketing legal payouts for police misconduct, trip and falls, and other lawsuits, which have risen from $64 million a decade ago to $289 million this fiscal year.

City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto cited a backlog of cases from the pandemic and structured settlements as contributing factors. Some plaintiffs' attorneys argue that Feldstein Soto's legal strategies, such as taking more cases to trial, are also contributing to the rising costs.</p>
