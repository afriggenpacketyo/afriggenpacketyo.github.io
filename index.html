          <p>Elon Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink, confirmed a significant network outage that affected users for several hours on Thursday, with over 60,000 reports logged at its peak. The disruption occurred shortly after T-Mobile launched its new satellite service powered by Starlink technology, which is designed to provide connectivity in remote areas. Musk apologized for the outage on X, and SpaceX engineers later confirmed that service was fully restored. T-Mobile stated its own new service was operating normally and was not impacted by the Starlink network issues.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump deflected inquiries about his past association with Jeffrey Epstein while Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, engaged in a second day of interviews with the Department of Justice. Trump suggested the focus should be on other public figures linked to Epstein, such as Bill Clinton. When asked about a potential pardon for Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, Trump stated he had not considered it. The interviews with Maxwell are part of ongoing pressure on the administration to release files related to the Epstein investigation.</p>

This interview comes amid growing public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release all files related to the Epstein investigation. Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered every question posed, marking the first time the government has formally questioned her in this manner since her conviction.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the nation is grappling with increased insecurity, economic hardship, and suppressed civil liberties. The junta, which cited Western influence and poor governance as reasons for the takeover, has overseen a period of decline, including significant job losses after forcing many non-governmental organizations to cease operations. Human rights groups report a severe crackdown on media and political opposition, with dozens of officials from the former government arbitrarily detained. The military leader's recent inauguration for a five-year term signals that a return to civilian rule is unlikely in the near future.</p>

          <p>Germany's postal service, dominated by Deutsche Post and DHL, is experiencing a surge in customer complaints, with nearly 23,000 filed in the first half of the year.

          <p>Following France's decision to formally recognize the state of Palestine, significant diplomatic pressure is now mounting on the UK to take a similar step. French officials hope their bold move will create momentum, suggesting that joint recognition by two UN Security Council members would be a powerful signal. However, the British government has traditionally viewed recognition as a final step in a peace process, not a trigger for one, fearing it could upset allies like the US and Israel. Prime Minister Keir Starmer now faces a difficult political choice, with growing calls for recognition from within his own party and the wider political sphere.</p>

Deadly building collapses are a recurring problem in India during the monsoon season, often due to poor construction and weak enforcement of safety codes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, escalating his long-standing conflict with media outlets. The lawsuit claims a recent story, which described a sexually suggestive birthday card Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, was libelous. This legal action is part of a broader pattern in which Trump has used lawsuits and administrative pressure to punish media organizations he deems critical, including barring their reporters from press events. Media analysts view the move as an attempt to intimidate news outlets and discredit reporting that is unfavorable to him.</p>

          <p>LaQuayia Goldring, 35, has received a new kidney from a living donor just days after her decade-long wait for a transplant was featured on "CBS Sunday Morning." Goldring, who had been on dialysis since her first transplanted kidney failed in 2014, had become a vocal advocate for others with advanced kidney disease. Her new kidney came from an unidentified man in Georgia who chose to become a living donor. Goldring plans to continue sharing her story to raise awareness about the critical importance of both living and deceased organ donation.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' human rights chief, Volker Turk, has criticized the UK government's decision to ban the activist group Palestine Action, calling it a "disturbing" and "disproportionate" use of counter-terrorism legislation. The group was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 after its activists claimed responsibility for damaging military aircraft. Turk argued the ban infringes on the rights to freedom of expression and assembly for many supporters not involved in criminal activity. He also criticized the UK's broad definition of terrorism, which includes serious property damage, as inconsistent with international standards.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with plans to formalize the decision at the United Nations in September. Citing a commitment to peace in the Middle East, Macron framed the move as a necessary step amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The decision drew strong condemnation from Israel, which argued it rewards terrorism, while the United States also voiced its rejection of the plan. France now joins over 140 other nations in recognizing Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Thailand's acting prime minister has warned that ongoing border clashes with Cambodia, which have already killed at least 16 people, could "move towards war." The fighting has reportedly intensified, involving heavy weapons across multiple locations and leading to the evacuation of Thai villages. Cambodia has accused Thailand of using banned cluster munitions, while Thailand has rejected calls for third-party mediation, insisting on a bilateral solution. The dispute, rooted in a century-old border demarcation, has escalated tensions to their lowest point in over a decade.</p>

          <p>A deputy speaker of the state parliament in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, has resigned after admitting to drawing a swastika on a ballot paper. Social Democrat politician Daniel Born stated he made a "serious mistake" during a vote involving a lawmaker from the far-right AfD party. Born attributed his actions to being in a state of "emotional distress" over the AfD's conduct. The state parliament president condemned the act, which is a criminal offense in Germany, and called on Born to give up his parliamentary seat entirely.</p>

          <p>Dame Cleo Laine, a celebrated British jazz singer renowned for her remarkable four-octave vocal range, has passed away at the age of 97. Throughout her extensive career, she became the first British singer to win a Grammy in a jazz category and performed alongside legends like Frank Sinatra. Her most significant collaboration was with her husband, musician John Dankworth, with whom she founded the Stables arts center in Buckinghamshire. Known for her distinctive voice and ability to cross musical genres, she was once described by a critic as "quite simply the best singer in the world."</p>

          <p>NASA is closely monitoring the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), a vast and growing region of weakened magnetic intensity over South America and the southwestern coast of Africa. This "dent" in the Earth's magnetic field poses a risk to orbiting spacecraft, including the International Space Station, by exposing them to higher levels of charged solar particles that can cause system malfunctions. Research indicates the anomaly is not only drifting but also appears to be splitting into two distinct cells. Scientists believe the phenomenon is a recurrent event, potentially linked to a massive, dense rock formation deep beneath the African continent.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that in her early career, she would budget just $40 to last for three days, a practice that taught her the value of financial security. While this method worked for her, financial advisors today caution against such restrictive, day-to-day budgeting for freelancers and gig workers with unpredictable income. Experts recommend a "bucketing strategy," where income is allocated by percentage to categories like essentials, savings, and taxes. This approach provides more flexibility to absorb income volatility and builds a more stable financial foundation than simply rationing cash. (not investment advice)</p>

The retailer, once a high-street staple, has struggled against intense competition from online giants like Shein and recently reported a £33.2m loss.

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board report concluded that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene "Buzzy" Peltola Jr., the husband of then-Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by the aircraft being overloaded. The plane was carrying a significant amount of moose meat, pushing it nearly 120 pounds over its maximum certified weight. Additionally, moose antlers had been improperly strapped to the wing, creating an unapproved external load. These factors degraded the plane's performance, leading to a loss of control shortly after takeoff in a remote area of Alaska.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) remain an attractive savings tool, with top accounts offering interest rates that exceed the current rate of inflation, thereby protecting the buying power of money. While national average yields are modest, online banks are providing highly competitive rates, particularly for short-term CDs of six months to one year. For example, some 1-year CDs offer rates around 4.40% APY, far surpassing the national average of 2.04%. Experts suggest savers consider online banks and potentially ladder their CDs to take advantage of the current inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>
