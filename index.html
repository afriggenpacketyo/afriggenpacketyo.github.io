          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom at the G7 summit, attributing its similarity to a previous agreement to minimal changes. He later announced his early departure from the summit, citing the escalating situation in the Middle East as the primary reason. Trump also warned "everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran." The schedule change included the cancellation of planned meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, with Trump emphasizing the importance of addressing urgent matters personally. Optimism in the region remains low amidst ongoing tensions.</p>

Lawmakers are now urging a dialling down of political rhetoric, with calls for unity and a focus on shared humanity.

          <p>Experts are questioning the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed gold smartphone can be entirely US-made, citing the lack of a high-tech supply chain in the United States. The announcement of the phone, retailing at $499 with a $47.45 monthly service fee, has also raised ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest. While the Trump Organization aims to manufacture the phones in the US eventually, analysts suggest assembly with imported parts is more likely. This venture extends the Trump family's business strategy of leveraging the Trump brand, which has significantly increased Trump's net worth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Federation of Teachers (AFT) chief Randi Weingarten faced criticism for her animated "No Kings Day" speech targeting President Trump, coinciding with her abrupt departure from the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

          <p>A new book, *Apple in China*, explores how Apple's deep entanglement with China revolutionized the country's manufacturing capabilities, and perhaps inadvertently threatened America's technological lead. Apple's partnership with Foxconn and the subsequent shift of manufacturing to mainland China led to the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and a massive, skilled workforce. The book highlights the immense investment Apple made in China, training millions of workers and contributing to the country's economic development. This transformation raises questions about the geopolitical implications of American companies bolstering potential adversaries.</p>

          <p>Extreme drought and water shortages are increasingly affecting crops, economies, and lives worldwide, with impacts varying by region and type of drought. Meteorological drought is defined by precipitation levels compared to regional averages, while agricultural drought impacts farming and crop production. Hydrological drought occurs when water levels in rivers, lakes, and reserves drop below minimum levels, often following meteorological drought. Socioeconomic drought impacts society and the economy, while ecological drought destabilizes ecosystems.

It can also function as a powerful communication device, transmitting battlefield data to over 300 platforms via optic fibers. This system achieves simultaneous same-frequency full-duplex communication and jamming capabilities, marking a leap in 6G military applications.</p>

          <p>Despite evidence to the contrary, President Trump is pursuing mass deportations, leading to a climate of fear in immigrant communities. Research indicates that illegal immigrants do not take jobs from native-born citizens and that removing them negatively impacts the economy. Trump's main advisor on immigration, Stephen Miller, advocates for a scorched-earth approach, rooted in a long history of xenophobia. Historical precedent, such as Operation Wetback, demonstrates that mass deportations are ineffective and cause alienation and mistrust, failing to address the underlying demand for cheap labor.</p>

          <p>A recent survey found that 90% of women investors feel "on track" to achieve their financial goals, but 85% wish they had started investing earlier. The average age at which women began investing was 31, with millennials starting at 27, Gen Xers at 31, and baby boomers at 36. The top reasons for delaying investing were a lack of financial knowledge and limited funds. Experts recommend starting early to harness the power of compounding and benefit from time in the market.

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is facing increasing isolation as key military and security advisors have been killed by Israeli air strikes. The loss of these advisors creates holes in his inner circle and increases the risk of strategic errors. The focus on regime survival has repeatedly been put to the test, with Khamenei relying on the Revolutionary Guards to quell national protests. Meanwhile, his son Mojtaba has grown more central to the decision-making process, building ties with the Guards.</p>
