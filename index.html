          <p>Two people were wounded in a shooting at the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology in Inglewood, California. The incident occurred on the school campus, and both victims, believed to be female employees, were taken to a nearby hospital with critical injuries. Police arrested a male suspect near Berendo and Twelfth streets in Pico-Union after receiving a 911 call from his family reporting the shooting and the location of the gun in his car. Dozens of people, thought to be staff and students, were seen outside the school as the investigation began.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 people were injured in Kharkiv, Ukraine, following a Russian drone strike that targeted residential buildings and civilian infrastructure. The attack came hours after a separate strike in Zaporizhzhia injured over 20 people. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, criticizing the slow response from allies in providing air defense systems. Russia announced a three-day ceasefire coinciding with Moscow's World War Two commemorations, which Kyiv has dismissed as a manipulative gesture for propaganda purposes.</p>

          <p>Federal transportation safety officials are investigating after two commercial flights had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to an Army helicopter entering restricted airspace. The helicopter, identified as a Black Hawk headed to the Pentagon, caused air traffic controllers to redirect Delta Air Lines Flight 1671 and Republic Airways Flight 5825. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed outrage, and Senator Ted Cruz called for legislation to improve civilian air safety.

          <p>A New York Times article reports that the water shortage during the Pacific Palisades fire was partially due to the city's failure to restore an old reservoir. The city had been planning to revive the Pacific Palisades Reservoir to temporarily boost water capacity while the main Santa Ynez Reservoir was offline for repairs. However, the plan was never completed due to safety issues, leaving the area with a limited water supply when the fire broke out. The inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the potential water supply in the area, leading to firefighters running out of water.</p>

The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession. The article notes that other firms have challenged similar orders, while some have made deals with the president to avoid such actions.</p>

This action follows an initial round of layoffs ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Millions of workers depend on NIOSH-approved respirators, and without these approvals, their safety is compromised.</p>
