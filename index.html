          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly diverged from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine stance, emphasizing the effectiveness and importance of certain vaccines. This shift followed a contentious Senate hearing where Kennedy's views were heavily criticized by Republican senators, including medical doctors. Trump highlighted his administration's own success with Operation Warp Speed, which accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development, and stated that some vaccines "just pure and simple work." The article suggests the move was a political calculation to cut losses after Kennedy's damaging testimony and growing criticism from conservative media. </p>

This funding round more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation and includes continued support from existing investors like Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz. The significant investment highlights the sustained financial interest in the AI sector and solidifies Mistral's position as a key European competitor to OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison sentence for a past corruption conviction. The court determined that his previous six-month stay in a hospital, immediately following his return from exile, did not lawfully count as time served. Thaksin, an influential figure in Thai politics for decades, was transferred to a hospital hours after beginning his original sentence, a move that drew public criticism over perceived special treatment. The ruling represents another significant setback for the Shinawatra political dynasty.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch family has been resolved, with an agreement ensuring Rupert Murdoch's son, Lachlan, will control the family's media empire after his father's death. The deal solidifies the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the terms, siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence will sell their holdings and cease to be beneficiaries of the trust containing Fox and News Corp shares, receiving cash instead.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed varied results, influenced by political shifts in Japan and a technology-driven rally on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225 index initially hit a record high before retreating following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, as investors anticipate potential new fiscal stimulus from his successor. Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reached its highest point since late 2021, while Indonesian markets fell after the unexpected dismissal of the country's finance minister. The market movements occurred as global investors await key U.S. inflation data later in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts anticipate that his successor will likely continue Tokyo's policy of viewing Beijing as a strategic competitor, maintaining pressure on diplomatic and security fronts. China's foreign ministry has refrained from commenting on the resignation, calling it an internal Japanese affair, but the leadership change in Tokyo will be closely watched by Beijing.</p>

It cites the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from Smithsonian museums and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" curriculum that downplays British imperialism. The author contends that this historical revisionism is a tactic to justify current policies, such as mass deportations, by creating a simplified narrative of a besieged nation.

          <p>The nearly four-year search for three missing children in New Zealand has ended after their fugitive father, Tom Phillips, was killed in a shootout with police. Two of the children were found at a remote campsite in the Waikato region, while the third was with Phillips at the time of his death. Phillips disappeared with his children in late 2021 after losing a custody battle, sparking a nationwide manhunt. Authorities, who also found firearms at the campsite, stated the children are doing well but face a long recovery from their ordeal.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has launched "Operation Midway Blitz," an enhanced immigration enforcement action in Chicago targeting individuals described as "criminal illegal aliens." The announcement drew a sharp rebuke from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who said they received no prior notice and accused the Trump administration of focusing on fear rather than public safety. The operation is being conducted in honor of a woman killed in a crash involving an undocumented immigrant. This move aligns with President Trump's recent threats to deploy federal forces to Democratic-led cities.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House committee has released documents from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including a redacted 238-page "birthday book" from 2003. The book contains messages from various high-profile individuals, including a note with a signature resembling that of Donald Trump and another from UK ambassador Peter Mandelson, who called Epstein his "best pal." The White House has denied the authenticity of the Trump note. The release, which also includes Epstein's will and address book, follows a subpoena from the committee and has renewed public scrutiny of Epstein's extensive network.</p>

          <p>A former head of security at WhatsApp has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against parent company Meta, alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" that could compromise the privacy of the messaging app's users. The plaintiff, Attaullah Baig, claims he was fired in retaliation after informing senior leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, about the issues. The lawsuit alleges that thousands of engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data without adequate monitoring. Meta has disputed the claims, stating that Baig was dismissed for poor performance and that his allegations misrepresent the company's security efforts.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Angela Rayner, the UK's Labour Party is holding an election for a new deputy leader, a contest that will reveal internal party dynamics now that Labour is in government. The tight election timetable has been criticized by some on the party's left wing as a "stitch up" designed to favor a candidate aligned with the leadership. The outcome is significant as it follows a recent cabinet reshuffle perceived as a shift to the right. The new deputy leader could act as a constructive critic or a source of internal friction for the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has voiced significant concern that the country might require an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund, similar to the 1976 sterling crisis. She attributes this risk to a lack of a clear economic growth plan from the current government, pointing to rising borrowing costs as a worrying sign. Badenoch offered to collaborate with the Labour government on welfare spending cuts to avert what she described as a "doom loop" of high taxes and unstable public finances. A Labour source dismissed the offer, blaming the previous Conservative government for the country's economic state. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes the Trump administration's use of the "Chipocalypse Now" meme to announce a crackdown on immigration in Chicago, describing it as a form of "memetic warfare." The author argues that by framing a serious threat of federal action as a pop-culture joke, the administration can dismiss criticism as humorless while still advancing an authoritarian agenda. The article connects the meme to the subsequent announcement of "Operation Midway Blitz," an immigration enforcement surge in the city. It concludes that such tactics are a deliberate effort to normalize aggressive policies and intimidate political opponents under the guise of playful banter.</p>

          <p>An analysis of trade deals under the Trump administration reveals that large orders for Boeing aircraft are a frequent component of agreements with various countries, including South Korea, Japan, and the UK. Experts suggest these high-value, high-profile purchases serve as a visible symbol of a country's commitment to reducing its trade surplus with the U.S., a key demand from President Trump. Because aircraft orders have long delivery timelines and are less politically sensitive than agricultural or steel imports, they provide a pragmatic way for nations to appease the administration. The deals also benefit an iconic American company amid a recovering global tourism industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fatal stabbing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte light rail train has ignited a national debate about public safety and the justice system's handling of repeat offenders. The victim, Iryna Zarutska, was killed in an apparently random attack by a suspect with a long history of criminal charges and psychiatric issues. The incident, captured on surveillance video, has drawn sharp criticism from national figures, including President Trump, who blame local "soft-on-crime" policies for the tragedy. In response, Charlotte's mayor acknowledged the event as a "tragic failure by the courts" and called for bipartisan solutions.</p>
