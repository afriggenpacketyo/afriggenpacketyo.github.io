          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron called on Europe and Asia to fortify coalition and avoid being caught in the intensifying rift between the U.S. and China. Addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Macron urged Indo-Pacific nations to establish a "new coalition" to counter the constraints stemming from the growing U.S.-China rivalry. He emphasized that France is a friend and ally of the United States and cooperates with China while adhering to its own interests. Macron's speech comes amid a regional tour to bolster France's defense cooperation, with recent deals signed with Vietnam and Indonesia. Macron warned that the unpredictability of the new tariff approach and the end of a rule-based order for trade will impact nations' economies and defense efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, celebrating a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. He stated the tariff increase would further secure the steel industry in the United States, and that the tariffs would also apply to imported aluminum, effective June 4. Trump praised the Nippon deal, suggesting it would revitalize the American steelmaker and ensure job security for steelworkers, promising a $5,000 bonus for each worker. (not investment advice) The announcement comes after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed his tariffs to remain in effect, but the United Steelworkers union remains wary of the Nippon deal's impact on national security.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts and that the prosecution threatens public trust in the judicial system.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Trump called Musk "one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced." Musk and his team have overhauled the work of the federal government, but he leaves with a tally falling far short of the initial $1 trillion goal. Trump indicated Musk will remain involved, and Musk said he would continue visiting the White House and serve as a "friend and adviser" to the president.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's departure from the Trump administration was marked by disillusionment and criticism. Despite Trump's praise, Musk fell short of his cost-cutting goals and faced resentment over his interference in the US government process. A New York Times report disclosed Musk's illicit drug intake, which he failed to address. Musk's black eye, explained as a result of horseplay with his son, served as a metaphor for his reputation as he prepared to leave Washington.</p>

The match also marked a transition in goalkeeping, with Hannah Hampton taking over after Mary Earps' retirement. Manager Sarina Wiegman celebrated more than usual in the dugout, and the team's performance lifted the mood after recent off-pitch attention.</p>

The new approach doubled the length of time patients were cancer-free, on average, from around 2.5 years to five years. Patients given pembrolizumab had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body.</p>

          <p>The Army has issued guidelines for expelling transgender troops, requiring them to voluntarily leave active-duty service by June 6, after which involuntary separations are expected to begin. The guidance instructs personnel to address transgender troops in accordance with their medical assignment at birth, and soldiers are to identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria. Transgender troops will receive an honorable discharge but are not eligible to rejoin the Army without a waiver. The guidance has been criticized for being worse than the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.</p>
