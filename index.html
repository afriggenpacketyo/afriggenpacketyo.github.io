          <p>Following post-election protests in Tbilisi, Georgia's Interior Ministry has arrested 13 individuals, adding to five rally organizers already detained on charges of attempting a government overthrow. The ruling Georgian Dream party has labeled the unrest a coup attempt, with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze vowing to prosecute those who clashed with police and accusing the EU of foreign interference. Civil society groups express growing concern that the government is using the events as a pretext for a broader crackdown on dissent, potentially banning opposition parties it deems as satellites of the former ruling party.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Singapore are investigating AI computing firm Megaspeed, a customer of Nvidia, for its alleged role in helping Chinese companies bypass U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chip exports. The U.S. Commerce Department is also reportedly conducting its own probe into whether Megaspeed, which purchased nearly $2 billion of Nvidia's products via a Malaysian subsidiary, violated American export controls. Nvidia stated its own inquiry found no evidence of product diversion, but the case highlights ongoing challenges in enforcing U.S. tech restrictions and concerns about a black market for smuggled high-end chips in China.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers. This move follows a nine-month investigation concluding that Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of U.K. searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation allows the CMA to impose new conduct requirements later this year, potentially mandating fairer search rankings and greater publisher control over content. Google expressed concern that the interventions could inhibit innovation and slow product launches in the U.K.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas commenced at noon local time, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along newly established deployment lines. This action initiates the first phase of an agreement that includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. As part of the deal, more humanitarian aid is scheduled to enter the Gaza Strip. To support and monitor the agreement, the U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel with 200 service members, who will not be deployed into Gaza.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reduced the list of candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair from eleven to five following extensive interviews. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, former economic advisor Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder.

          <p>A Colorado pastor's act of compassion for a pizza delivery driver who brought the wrong order has gone viral, leading to a successful fundraiser. After the driver, Suzanna, apologized for the mix-up, Pastor Neal Seiwert and his family prayed with her on their porch for her well-being, a moment captured by a Ring camera. The video gained millions of views on social media, prompting the Seiwerts to start a GoFundMe campaign for Suzanna with her permission. The fundraiser quickly surpassed its $25,000 goal, demonstrating a widespread positive response to the family's gesture of kindness and faith.</p>

          <p>A provision from the Secure 2.0 Act is set to alter how high earners make 401(k) catch-up contributions, eliminating a popular tax break. Beginning in 2026, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account, rather than a traditional pretax one. This change removes the upfront tax deduction for these contributions, though withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, an organization affiliated with Columbia University, has secured a major legal victory against the Trump administration over the detention of pro-Palestinian students. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and others was unconstitutional and designed to suppress free speech. The ruling highlights a stark contrast between the institute's defiant defense of constitutional principles and Columbia University's more conciliatory approach, which recently included a settlement with the administration over antisemitism claims. The case has positioned the Knight Institute at the forefront of legal challenges to the administration's actions regarding campus speech.</p>

          <p>Actress Alex Kingston, known for her roles in "ER" and "Doctor Who," has revealed she was diagnosed with womb cancer last year. The 62-year-old star, currently competing on "Strictly Come Dancing," underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, finishing her treatment in late 2024. Kingston stated she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging before seeking medical help after a more serious symptom appeared. She is now urging other women not to ignore signs of ill health, explaining that her diagnosis inspired her to participate in the dance show because "life is too short."</p>

          <p>German prosecutors and state police have searched the homes and offices of 17 Frankfurt police officers suspected of assault, obstruction of justice, and wrongful prosecution. The investigation concerns allegations that six men were physically harmed during or after their arrests between February and April, with officers potentially filing false cases to conceal their actions. Approximately 150 officers participated in the raids, seizing phones and data devices. Investigators have stated that there are currently no indications of extremist motives behind the alleged misconduct, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The rapid bankruptcy of First Brands, a major auto parts manufacturer, has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street over potential systemic risks in the private debt market. The company, which owns brands like Trico, filed for bankruptcy after concerns arose about its extensive use of opaque, off-balance-sheet financing to borrow against invoices. This collapse, along with the recent failure of sub-prime auto lender Tricolor, has fueled fears that the unregulated "shadow banking" sector has extended too much credit to unstable companies, creating risks of contagion that could eventually impact the broader financial system.

          <p>A federal appeals court is considering whether President Trump has the authority to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, where small, nightly protests have been ongoing. The hearing follows a lower court's temporary restraining order that blocked the president's move, which the state's attorney general argued was based on descriptions of violence "untethered from reality." The case tests the limits of presidential power to deploy the National Guard for domestic law enforcement, a power Trump has suggested he intends to use more broadly in cities like Chicago and Memphis to confront what he calls "leftwing domestic terrorism."</p>

After his death, O'Brien inherited the stone, which she used as a garden decoration and forgot when she sold the house in 2018. The new owners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the object's significance, and it is now being repatriated to its original museum in Italy.</p>

The author criticizes current Democratic leadership as uninspiring and suggests that an early, bold campaign could capture the nation's attention and challenge Trump's narrative. The proposed candidate would need to communicate bold ideas, focus on substantive issues like housing and healthcare, and be willing to challenge party orthodoxy.

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's plan to end "gifted and talented" programs for kindergartners has ignited a broader debate within the Democratic party about academic tracking. Critics argue that eliminating such programs holds back high-achieving students in the name of equity, while proponents contend that tracking deepens racial and economic disparities. While sorting students by ability at such a young age is unusual, the controversy reflects a larger, more consequential discussion over whether ability grouping benefits all students by allowing for tailored instruction or harms lower performers and perpetuates inequality.</p>

          <p>Amid a divisive social climate, the legacy of composer Leonard Bernstein's musical memorials to President John F. Kennedy provides a model for collective grieving and national healing. Bernstein famously conducted Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony on national television just two days after JFK's assassination in 1963, a legendary act that riveted the nation. He later wrote his "MASS" to open the Kennedy Center in 1971, a work that initially shocked audiences but is now seen as a masterpiece that transcends genre. These works demonstrate how music can address the essence of grief and cherish existence without engaging in political division.</p>

The information came from the man who was paralyzed in the shootout that killed Franco, who identified Quintero as his accomplice in exchange for a reduced sentence. Despite this sworn statement, prosecutors did not charge Quintero with the murder until July of this year.

He recalls grueling 14-hour workdays and exploitation, arguing that a modern program would strip workers of rights and subject them to the whims of the government. Alvarado suggests that instead of deporting existing undocumented workers and replacing them, the U.S. should allow those already here to stay.</p>
