High probabilities are placed on terms like "China" and "Tariff," reflecting ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions impacting the company's manufacturing and sales. This unusual betting market, which has attracted significant trading volume, highlights the intense scrutiny on Apple's strategy amid pressure to shift production from China and navigate potential U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has announced a significant shift in its Middle East policy, indicating it may formally recognize a Palestinian state as early as September. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated this move is conditional on Israel's government meeting certain terms, including a ceasefire and commitment to a long-term peace process. This change departs from Britain's long-held position that recognition should only come after a negotiated peace deal and reflects growing domestic and international pressure. The policy pivot aims to leverage statehood recognition as a tool to advance the two-state solution amid the ongoing Gaza conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal authority to impose broad tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The case centers on the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law never before used to set such widespread levies. Judges expressed skepticism, noting that the law does not explicitly mention tariffs and that the administration's interpretation could grant the president "unbounded authority," disrupting the entire trade framework established by Congress. The legal challenge, brought by states and small businesses, represents a major test of the president's economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent column in The Atlantic explores the common phenomenon of impostor syndrome, where high-achieving individuals secretly feel like frauds despite their proven skills. The article notes that this feeling is prevalent among perfectionists and those in technical fields, and while it can motivate improvement, it often leads to anxiety and burnout. To combat this, the author suggests three key strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of accomplishments, and building a supportive peer community. These methods help reframe one's perspective from self-doubt to a focus on growth and learning.</p>

          <p>A photo of LeBron James and his business partner Maverick Carter meeting with Nikola Jokic's agent, Misko Raznatovic, has fueled speculation about a new international basketball league. Raznatovic's cryptic social media post hinted at "big plans for the fall of 2026," aligning with reports of a well-funded effort to create a tour-based league modeled after Formula 1. The proposed league, backed by international investors, would feature men's and women's teams competing in cities outside the U.S. and may require players to cut ties with the NBA, creating a model similar to LIV Golf.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called on President Donald Trump not to consider a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell. In a powerful statement, they described Maxwell as a "monster" who preyed on Giuffre and deserves to remain in prison for life. The family also questioned Trump's recent comments about being aware that Giuffre was "stolen" from her job at his Mar-a-Lago club, asking if he knew about Epstein and Maxwell's criminal activities. A White House official has stated that no leniency for Maxwell is being discussed.</p>

          <p>A Michigan program called Rx Kids is providing a potential model for mitigating child-rearing costs by giving new mothers unconditional cash payments. The program, funded by a mix of state and philanthropic money, provides up to $7,500 during a woman's pregnancy and the first year of her child's life. With no income requirements, it aims to reduce financial vulnerability during a critical period for both parents and babies. The initiative has garnered bipartisan support and is seen by proponents as a practical way to support families, improve maternal and infant health, and address voter concerns over high child care costs.</p>

          <p>The new agency overseeing name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals in college sports, the College Sports Commission, has relaxed its standards for third-party payments to athletes. The commission will now permit deals with collectives if they have a "valid business purpose," defined as promoting goods or services for profit to the public. This change moves away from a stricter interpretation that threatened the operating model of many collectives established to pay players. The agreement was reached after plaintiff attorneys in the landmark House settlement case threatened further legal action, clarifying the evolving landscape of athlete compensation.</p>

McIntire, who has run 10 marathons, has always aligned her athletic pursuits with a higher purpose, riding with a team that raises money for families at Dana-Farber and Boston Children's. She considers it a "cool reason" to miss the event, knowing she helped save a life.</p>
