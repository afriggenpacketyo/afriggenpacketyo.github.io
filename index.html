          <p>A second man has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life, following fires at properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The charges relate to a vehicle fire and fires at two addresses, one being Starmer's private home and another his former residence. Stanislav Carpiuc, a Romanian national, is accused of conspiring with Roman Lavrynovych, a Ukrainian national, to damage property by fire, potentially endangering lives. Lavrynovych previously denied similar charges, and Carpiuc has been remanded in custody until their joint appearance at the Old Bailey. Relevant context includes that the fires occurred at properties linked to the Prime Minister, raising concerns about potential political motivations.</p>

          <p>Retired four-star Admiral Robert Burke was convicted on corruption charges for steering a $355,000 Navy contract to a company in exchange for a promised $500,000-a-year job after his retirement. Burke was found guilty of bribery, performing acts affecting personal financial interest, and concealment of material facts. The Department of Justice stated that Burke also tried unsuccessfully to convince another officer to award the firm a separate contract. The conviction marks Burke as the most senior officer convicted in recent years for crimes committed while serving in the U.S. military, highlighting ongoing issues with corruption within the Navy.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Ted Decker, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, leveraging its scale and supplier partnerships to absorb potential cost increases. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's anticipated price hikes in response to tariffs. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, anticipating a 2.8% growth in total sales and a 1% increase in comparable sales. Decker noted that Home Depot has diversified its import sources, reducing reliance on any single country outside the U.S. to below 10% by next year, and also mentioned that the company caters to a more affluent U.S. consumer who tends to be employed and to have benefited from the sharp increase of property values since 2019.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed tax and spending bill is facing scrutiny from Wall Street due to projections that its tax breaks will outweigh spending cuts, potentially adding trillions to the U.S. deficit. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, estimating the bill could add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. The bill includes extensions of President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire, and new tax breaks. Economists and policy experts worry that increased debt could strain federal spending and make it harder to fund essential programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has secured trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, these agreements required concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished position and the challenges of operating between global trading blocs. While the EU deal could generate significant benefits by 2040, it adds only marginally to Britain's GDP, whereas Brexit had a far greater negative impact. To finalize these deals, Starmer allowed European trawlers to fish in British waters and granted greater access to American agricultural products.</p>

Additionally, some of Trump's newest voters, including youth and people of color, are not returning to the Democratic Party.

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, Kerry Morgan, Cassie Ventura's mother, testified about witnessing alleged assaults on Ventura by Combs. Morgan claimed Combs caused her to have a concussion after throwing a hanger at her and that she received $30,000 from Combs after threatening a lawsuit. Defense attorneys focused on jealousy as a motive for Combs' alleged violence, while prosecutors argued jealousy was not a factor in the assaults Morgan witnessed.

          <p>President Trump's cuts to U.S. foreign aid are jeopardizing infrastructure projects in Africa, including an overpass in Ivory Coast financed by the American people. The Trump administration is shifting its focus to commercial diplomacy, prioritizing trade over aid. This shift has led to the dismantling of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an agency that funds large infrastructure projects in developing countries. Experts warn that these cuts could undermine American influence and hinder economic growth in Africa, even as they align with Trump's pro-trade policies.</p>

The new guidelines seek to prevent negative experiences that can lead to patient distrust and worsen pain. The guidelines also acknowledge historical inequalities in treating pain, noting that Black patients and women have historically received less analgesia.</p>
