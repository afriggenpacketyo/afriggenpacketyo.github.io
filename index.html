          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest and announced a $100,000 reward in the manhunt for the individual responsible for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities recovered a high-powered bolt-action rifle believed to be the murder weapon and are analyzing it for DNA and fingerprints. Officials emphasize this was a targeted attack, with President Trump and other leaders condemning the violence and linking it to political rhetoric. The university remains closed as the investigation continues, with law enforcement tracking the suspect's movements and appealing for public assistance.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, received a 54-month prison sentence for her role in a federal bribery scheme. She was convicted of accepting cash and gold bars for political favors, including a Mercedes-Benz. Prosecutors sought a longer term, but the judge considered her ongoing breast cancer treatments and childhood trauma, though noting her central participation in the scheme. Menendez tearfully addressed the court, blaming her husband for involving her in illegal activities, but affirmed she would not divorce him. Her husband, Bob Menendez, is currently serving an 11-year sentence for his related conviction.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have experienced their most significant weekly drop in a year, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling to 6.35% from 6.5%. This marks the lowest average since last October, prompting a surge in borrower demand. Both home purchase and refinancing applications saw substantial weekly and annual increases, with refinances accounting for nearly half of the applications. The decline in rates is attributed to lower Treasury yields, influenced by data indicating a weakening labor market and lower-than-expected job growth figures.</p>

          <p>Beijing has strongly condemned Mexico's proposed tariff increases of up to 50% on selected imports, asserting that the measures are aimed at China. Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that China firmly rejects actions taken under coercion to constrain its legitimate rights and interests, vowing to protect them. Mexico's government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, claims the tariffs are necessary to protect local jobs in strategic sectors like automobiles and textiles, a move that comes amid increasing U.S. pressure on countries to align trade policies against Beijing.</p>

          <p>Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has lost his latest legal challenge in New Zealand to prevent his extradition to the United States on charges related to his Megaupload file-sharing website. A High Court judge dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the extradition decision was politically motivated and that he would face disproportionate treatment in the U.S. This ruling marks another chapter in a 13-year legal battle, with Dotcom's lawyers indicating they still have 'much fight left.' Two of his former business partners previously pleaded guilty in New Zealand, avoiding U.S. extradition.</p>

          <p>Joint military exercises between Russia and Belarus, dubbed Zapad 2025, are triggering heightened concern in the Baltic states, particularly Lithuania. Scheduled to involve tens of thousands of soldiers and Russia's new Oreshnik missiles, these drills are viewed as a potential long-term threat. Lithuania has increased its military budget and border patrols, preparing for a range of provocations including migrant-related 'hybrid attacks' and drone incursions. Experts worry about a potential lasting Russian military presence in Belarus, drawing parallels to the lead-up to the Ukraine invasion, while NATO's presence offers some reassurance.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old right-wing political activist, was murdered by a sniper at a speaking event, marking the end of a career that saw him gain significant influence within the conservative youth movement. As the founder of Turning Point USA, Kirk was a fluent debater and effective organizer, known for promoting divisive views on gender, race, and gun control. He was a close confidant of President Donald Trump, who hailed him as a 'martyr for truth.' This article reflects on Kirk's controversial legacy, including his advocacy for Christian nationalism and promotion of conspiracy theories, while noting his knack for appealing to disaffected young white men.</p>

          <p>Inflation accelerated in August, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 2.9% year-over-year, the fastest pace since January, driven by higher prices for food and electricity. Economists attribute much of the increase in goods prices to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, particularly affecting apparel, household furnishings, and appliances. Services inflation has also stalled, offering little counterbalance to rising goods costs. Despite a cooling labor market, the Federal Reserve faces difficult choices, with expectations of interest rate cuts to prevent economic decline, risking further entrenched inflation.

Separately, the Trust would trim its Broadcom position, which has swelled after a nearly 20% gain post-earnings, to manage portfolio size and lock in profits.

It then draws parallels to the Jewish ritual of shiva, suggesting it provides a framework for processing complex grief without sanitizing the deceased's public persona.

          <p>This article explores six science-backed strategies to manage negative affect and boost mood, particularly for those who experience morning grumpiness. Author Arthur C. Brooks shares his personal protocol, starting with predawn rising, which is linked to improved attentiveness. The routine includes vigorous physical exercise, focused meditation or prayer, and delayed caffeine intake to counter lethargy. A protein-rich first meal, high in tryptophan, is recommended to raise serotonin activity and promote calm. Finally, dedicating mornings to creative, flow-inducing work helps maintain emotional equilibrium and maximize productive output throughout the day.</p>
