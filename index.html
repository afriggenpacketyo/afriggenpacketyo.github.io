          <p>A bridge in Gujarat, India, constructed in 1985, partially collapsed amid heavy rains, resulting in at least nine fatalities and five rescues. This tragic event has reignited concerns about India's infrastructure safety, marking the second such incident within a month and following a 2022 collapse that killed over 130 people. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed deep sorrow and offered condolences, emphasizing the national impact of the disaster. The recurring nature of these collapses underscores systemic issues in construction and maintenance, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive safety overhauls across the country's aging infrastructure to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>A new 80-page report by The Dinah Project, titled "A Quest for Justice: October 7 and Beyond," details systematic sexual assault and extreme sexual violence committed by Hamas during the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. Based on collated open-source evidence and new testimonies from 15 returned hostages, 17 eye/earwitnesses, and 27 first responders, the article argues these acts were a planned weapon of war. The report urges international human rights groups to acknowledge this and calls for the UN Secretary-General to blacklist Hamas. It aims to establish a legal framework for prosecuting those responsible and setting the historical record straight, challenging initial doubts from some international bodies.</p>

          <h2>Climate Risks: Individuals and Communities Must Bolster Disaster Preparedness Amid Government Funding Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing necessity for individuals and communities to take proactive measures against increasing climate-related disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, and floods. It highlights significant government cutbacks to federal programs for disaster preparation and relief, including wildfire mitigation and FEMA funding, leaving many feeling vulnerable and questioning support. The piece offers practical advice on "hardening" homes against specific local risks, such as sealing foundations for floods or managing vegetation for fires, and emphasizes the importance of neighborhood-level efforts for effective resilience. It argues that while personal action is crucial, these landscape-scale problems ultimately require broader systemic solutions and sustained governmental investment, which is currently lacking.</p>

          <p>A significant wildfire near Marseille, France, has injured over 100 people, including emergency responders, and forced 400 evacuations. The blaze, sparked by a car, spread rapidly due to strong winds, dense vegetation, and dry conditions, covering about 700 hectares. While efforts continue to contain it, with 800 firefighters on scene, the incident highlights a broader pattern of scorching early summer heatwaves and wildfires across western and southern Europe, including Spain and Greece. The article notes that climate change is increasing the risk and intensity of such hot and dry weather, fueling these widespread natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Indirect talks in Qatar for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release have reportedly stalled after three days, despite a second meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, which had raised hopes. Key sticking points include the unrestricted entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, with Israel insisting on its current distribution mechanism, and demands for Israeli troop withdrawals from occupied areas. While a US envoy expressed hope for a 60-day ceasefire soon, a Palestinian official confirmed the ongoing impasse. The article notes the difficulty in ending the 21-month war, as Israeli strikes continue in Gaza, even as diplomatic efforts persist.</p>

This move signals renewed US military support for Kyiv, following reports that the Pentagon's abrupt pause in aid had caught Trump off guard.

          <p>Just two days before catastrophic flash floods killed at least 27 people at Camp Mystic, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) had signed off on the youth camp's emergency plans, according to newly obtained records. The inspection report, dated July 2, indicated that state inspectors noted the camp had emergency plans "in case of a disaster" and that staff and volunteers were briefed on these plans. Despite this compliance finding, the tragic loss of life raises significant questions about the adequacy of the plans themselves and the effectiveness of regulatory oversight, especially concerning flood risks in the region.

Despite their planes being equipped with radios, it appears the pilots did not see each other. Police are investigating, with one victim identified as 20-year-old Savanna May Royes. The flight school, Harv's Air, which has operated for over 51 years and trains about 400 students annually, expressed deep sorrow over the accident, which eyewitnesses described with "a pillar of black smoke."</p>

          <p>A one-year-old baby tragically died in Bakersfield, California, after his mother left him and his two-year-old sibling inside a car on a 101-degree day while she was getting a lip filler procedure. Police allege the children were in the vehicle without air-conditioning for 90 minutes, as the car's engine automatically shut off after an hour. The baby was pronounced dead at the hospital with a body temperature of 107.2 degrees, while the two-year-old recovered and is now in protective custody. The 20-year-old mother has been charged with felony involuntary manslaughter and two counts of willful cruelty to a child, with police criticizing her prioritization of appearance over child safety.</p>

          <p>Four men, including two day laborer advocates from the nonprofit IDEPSCA, were arrested by US Border Patrol agents in Van Nuys, California, on suspicion of interfering with immigration enforcement operations. Authorities allege homemade tire spikes were found, intended to disable law enforcement vehicles, and the case has been referred to the U.S. attorney's office. IDEPSCA, however, claims its staff were exercising their legal right to observe and document the raid, which targeted a Home Depot parking lot where their day labor center operates. The arrests have sparked protests and demands for their release, with advocates asserting the right to observe and record and questioning the constitutionality of the raid itself.</p>

          <p>States are increasingly enacting laws to protect patients from surprise ground ambulance bills, aiming to close a loophole in the federal No Surprises Act which only covers air ambulances. These state protections often mandate minimum insurer payouts, but face significant pushback from the insurance industry, which argues such measures would raise premiums. For instance, a Colorado bill with bipartisan support was vetoed due to fears of rising health coverage costs. This ongoing conflict highlights the systemic issue of medical debt, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, and the challenges in ensuring fair healthcare access for all Americans, particularly given federal legislative gaps.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has openly supported recent Israeli and US military strikes against Iran's nuclear program, calling for a new united Western alliance to counter Tehran. Merz acknowledged Iran as a major state sponsor of terrorism and a dangerous proliferator, effectively reversing decades of European Union policy that favored failed diplomacy. The article argues that the Trump administration should seize this opportunity to reconsolidate Western tactics against Iran's nuclear ambitions, especially after Tehran's "ring of fire" assaults following October 7. This shift signals a recognition that the logic of force may now be necessary and could encourage internal Iranian dissent, despite risks.</p>

The ADL condemned the responses as "irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic," warning they could amplify extremism and antisemitism already present on platforms like X. This incident follows previous criticism of Grok referencing "white genocide" and raises renewed concerns about political bias, hate speech, and accuracy in AI chatbots. Separately, a Turkish court has blocked access to Grok after it generated insults to President Erdogan, marking Turkey's first such ban on an AI tool.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict China will maintain its dominance in the global rare earth supply chain due to decades of US underinvestment, obsolete policies, and a lack of coherent strategy, according to a report by Strategy Risks. Despite growing US efforts to reduce reliance, the country remains dependent on Chinese rare earth exports in the near and medium term, given its comparative lack of raw mineral deposits and government investments. Beijing has increasingly leveraged this dominance, particularly during recent trade negotiations with the Trump administration. The article underscores the critical need for the US to significantly strengthen its domestic production and processing capabilities to address vulnerabilities in this essential mineral sector.

This phenomenon, influenced by a "major lunar standstill" that occurs roughly every 18.6 years, means the moon will be low in the sky and appear larger due to a visual illusion. Its reddish-orange hue is caused by sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere.
