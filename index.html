          <p>The Walt Disney Company and Miral have partnered to develop a Disney theme park and resort on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, marking Disney's seventh theme park destination. Miral will handle the full development and construction, while Disney's Imagineers will lead the creative design and operational oversight. This project is separate from Disney's $60 billion investment in its existing theme parks and aims to tap into the region's growing tourism market, with about one-third of the world's population within a four-hour flight of the UAE. The new park will feature themed accommodations, unique dining, and retail experiences, blending Disney's storytelling with Abu Dhabi's culture and futuristic elements.</p>

          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora has cautioned that U.S. tariffs could lead to significant price increases across the affordable jewelry sector. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that while current 10% levies are manageable, higher 'reciprocal' rates would be game-changing for manufacturers who import from Asia. Pandora, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, had previously warned of a potential revenue hit due to President Trump's tariff announcements, however, the impact on consumer pricing will likely be industry-led.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of tariffs, particularly the 10 percent tariff on most U.S. imports, has led to a new acceptance of trade barriers, with some corporate executives viewing it as 'the new zero.' While initially causing market turmoil, the acceptance of these tariffs reflects a growing sentiment against predatory trade practices, especially from China. This normalization is due to the psychological effect of anchoring, where larger threatened tariffs make the existing ones seem less severe, however the average effective tariff rate consumers face is 28 percent, the highest since 1901.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a surge after the company indicated that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the second half of the year due to the phasing out of copycat compounded drugs. The company reported first-quarter net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner, but lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to competition from alternative versions of Wegovy in the U.S. The drugmaker expects sales to rebound following the FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling, which will allow Novo Nordisk to pursue companies unlawfully distributing copycat drugs.</p>
