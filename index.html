          <p>A double-decker bus crashed into a low bridge in Eccles, Salford, resulting in its roof being completely torn off. The incident, which occurred around 3:00 PM BST, injured fifteen people who were subsequently transported to local hospitals for treatment. This is not the first time such an accident has happened at this specific location, with a similar crash occurring at the same bridge in April 2023. Emergency services, including an air ambulance, responded to the scene, and local roads were closed as authorities managed the situation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has named George Tidmarsh, a seasoned biotech executive and Stanford professor, as the new director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. This key division oversees the approval of most new prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The appointment comes amidst significant changes at the FDA under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose leadership has caused concern in the scientific community. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background is seen as a potentially stabilizing force, and his past statements suggest a more stringent approach to drug regulation.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by attracting budget-conscious diners amidst industry-wide struggles. The company reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, attributing the growth to its new stuffed crust pizza and value-oriented promotions that resonated with customers across all income levels. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while other restaurants offer deals on less desirable items, Domino's provides value on products consumers actually want. Despite this success, the company's earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its investment in its China licensee.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal funding. The White House has demanded changes to the university's policies on antisemitism and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs as a condition for releasing the funds. During a court hearing, Harvard's lawyers argued the administration is unconstitutionally attempting to control the university's internal operations and infringing on free speech. The government's lawyer countered that Harvard violated an executive order on combating antisemitism, but the judge questioned the lack of clear procedure from the administration.</p>

          <p>An armed group opened fire in a bar in General Villamil Playas, a coastal tourist city in Ecuador, killing at least nine people who were playing pool. The attack is part of a larger wave of violence plaguing the nation as drug trafficking organizations expand their influence. The homicide rate in Ecuador has surged dramatically in recent years, turning the once-peaceful country into a hotbed of cartel activity. This massacre follows the recent recapture and extradition of notorious drug lord Adolfo Macias, alias "Fito," whose gang, Los Choneros, is a major source of the ongoing violence.</p>

Graduate and professional students have a higher aggregate limit of $138,500, including any undergraduate loans. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, students often need to seek private loans to bridge the financial gap. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike other crypto treasury firms that simply hold assets, this company plans to actively generate returns through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security and operations. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues that this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as staking provides a yield similar to a dividend.

          <p>At the behest of President Trump, the Texas Legislature has begun a special session to redraw the state's congressional district map, a move aimed at increasing the number of Republican seats in the U.S. House. This mid-decade redistricting effort is highly unusual, as the current maps were established after the 2020 Census. The Trump administration's Justice Department has also alleged that several existing districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, providing a legal pretext for the changes.

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing concern linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Scientific research suggests that overcoming this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than a single quick fix. Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the device, such as leaving it out of the bedroom, and reducing its appeal by turning off notifications or setting the screen to black-and-white. For deeper-rooted issues, therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the underlying causes of the compulsive behavior.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the notorious Ecuadorian drug trafficker known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States and pleaded not guilty to multiple charges in a New York court. Fito, the leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, faces counts of international cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and weapons trafficking. His extradition marks a significant moment for Ecuador, which has been battling a surge in gang-related violence largely fueled by groups like Los Choneros. Fito was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in 2024.</p>

          <p>A recent survey found that Americans, on average, believe they would need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable. However, some financial experts argue that net worth can be a misleading indicator of financial well-being. They suggest that focusing on cash flow—the movement of money in and out of one's life—provides a more practical and dynamic picture of financial health. Financial comfort is achieved when money management aligns with personal values and goals, rather than hitting an arbitrary numerical target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has recommended that YouTube give greater prominence to content from public service broadcasters (PSBs) like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4. The watchdog warned that the future of public service media is at risk because young audiences spend significantly more time on YouTube than watching traditional broadcast content. Ofcom's report suggests that PSBs must work with YouTube to ensure their material is easy to find, and it proposes that the government consider legislation to enforce this. The goal is to help tackle a serious threat to the UK's broadcasting ecosystem.</p>
