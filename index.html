        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World darts champion Luke Littler has secured a spot in the World Matchplay semifinals after a tense 16-14 victory over Andrew Gilding in Blackpool. Despite Gilding's late-game rally, the 18-year-old maintained his composure to close out the match. He will now face Northern Ireland's Josh Rock, who defeated Gerwyn Price 16-11 in his own quarter-final match. Littler, who averaged over 103 and threw 18 maximums, expressed relief and noted the crowd got an exciting contest. The semi-finals are set for Saturday evening, promising more high-stakes action.</p>

          <h2>Senior NOAA Officials Placed on Leave Amid Speculation of Political Retaliation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:18:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Jeff Dillen and Stephen Volz, have been placed on administrative leave. This action has fueled speculation of retaliation, as both men led the investigation into the 2019 "Sharpiegate" incident, which found that former agency leaders violated scientific integrity policies under political pressure. NOAA has stated the leaves are for separate performance and unrelated matters, but current and former staffers express skepticism, viewing it as an attempt to undermine the science-focused agency. The move comes just before a confirmation hearing for the former NOAA chief involved in the scandal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Army has successfully conducted the first-ever live-fire test of its new precision strike missile (PrSM) in the Indo-Pacific, launching it from a HIMARS vehicle in Australia. This next-generation weapon, with a range exceeding 300 miles, is designed to hit moving targets on both land and sea, significantly enhancing long-range strike capabilities in the region. The test is a demonstration of the growing military partnership between the U.S. and Australia amid rising regional tensions. Army officials emphasized the missile system's agility and its role in deterring potential adversaries by holding vast areas at risk.</p>

          <p>An app named Tea, which allows women to review men they have dated and share safety information, has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. The platform functions as a centralized community for women to vet potential partners by sharing experiences and accessing background check information. While proponents praise its focus on safety, a feature often lacking in traditional dating apps, some have raised concerns about the potential for false information to be shared. The app recently confirmed a data breach, highlighting the security risks associated with centralizing such sensitive personal information.</p>

          <p>The tenure of Bill Essayli, the interim U.S. attorney for the Los Angeles region, has been marked by controversy and accusations of hyper-partisanship. Appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, Essayli has aggressively pursued the Trump administration's agenda, filing lawsuits against California's sanctuary and transgender athlete policies, leading to criticism from legal experts and activists. His leadership has reportedly caused mass departures of career prosecutors and low morale within the office. As his temporary appointment nears its end, his supporters praise his zealousness while critics fear the long-term damage to the office's integrity if he is permanently appointed.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a sudden descent of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential mid-air collision on Friday. The maneuver occurred over the Angeles National Forest as the aircraft was climbing to its cruising altitude. Flight data showed a military jet was in the vicinity at a similar altitude, traveling in the opposite direction. While no passengers reported injuries, two flight attendants are being treated for injuries sustained during the incident. Southwest confirmed the aircraft responded to onboard traffic alerts and is cooperating with the FAA to investigate the circumstances.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans jail, already under fire for a recent mass escape, has mistakenly released another detainee. Khalil Bryan, held on serious charges including home invasion, was let go due to a clerical error where deputies failed to properly verify an inmate's identity during a bond process. The local district attorney's office called the incident an "unacceptable lapse" that highlights systemic issues at the facility. The sheriff took full responsibility, attributing the mistake to human error involving a shared last name and promising disciplinary action. This event adds to the intense pressure on the sheriff's office.</p>

Experts noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge, not high-ranking officials, raising questions about the motive and credibility of any information obtained. The situation is further complicated by Blanche's prior role as a personal attorney for President Trump and the recent firing of the prosecutor who led the Maxwell case.

The court found that the order, which seeks to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment. The amendment grants citizenship to "all persons born in the United States." The Trump administration has argued its policy is a valid interpretation of the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause, an argument the court rejected.

          <h2>Experts Predict Higher Consumer Prices as New U.S. Tariff Regime Takes Shape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 17:12:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's trade policy is establishing a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on foreign goods, which economists warn will likely lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. Even as new trade deals are negotiated, this higher floor for tariffs is expected to impact a range of industries, from apparel to electronics. Companies like Nestlé and General Electric have already indicated they are considering or have implemented price hikes to offset increased costs. While the White House disputes that consumers will bear the cost, analyses project that the new tariff structure could drive up U.S. prices significantly over the next two years.

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump on homelessness has drawn sharp criticism from advocates and local officials, who fear it promotes the criminalization of unhoused individuals. The order links homelessness to "vagrancy" and "violent attacks" and directs federal agencies to fund encampment removals and encourage civil commitment for people with mental illness. It also seeks to divert funding from "Housing First" and "harm reduction" strategies. While some see potential funding opportunities for moving people indoors, many are concerned the punitive tone and policies will ultimately worsen the crisis by punishing people for being poor and sick.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has announced a new grant program of over $600 million available to states and localities for the purpose of detaining undocumented migrants. This funding is intended to relieve overcrowding in short-term holding facilities while individuals await transfer to federal custody. The move represents a significant shift for the agency, which previously administered a program to support services for migrants after their release. Critics see this as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to use state resources to carry out mass deportation policies and redefine FEMA's mission.</p>

          <p>This lifestyle essay from The Atlantic Daily explores the idea of incorporating small, intentional moments of joy into everyday life to replicate the positive feelings of a vacation. The author suggests that rather than succumbing to post-holiday sadness, one can actively cultivate delight through simple acts like luxurious stretches, reading physical books, or savoring a special drink. The article shares examples from colleagues who find happiness in daily rituals, such as tending to plants, calling friends, or engaging in specific bedtime routines with their children. The piece advocates for prioritizing these small pleasures as a form of practical self-care and a way to make ordinary life feel more special.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits Scotland, residents living near his Aberdeenshire golf course have mixed opinions about their famous neighbor. Some locals, like David Milne, whose home is now surrounded by the course, express frustration over the transformation of the natural landscape and resent Trump's past dismissive comments. These sentiments are echoed by planned protests and polls showing his unpopularity in Scotland. However, others point to the positive economic impact of the resort, which employs over 80 people, and argue that politics should be kept separate from the world-class golf facility he has built in the area.</p>

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her role in a massive fraud scheme that helped North Korean IT workers use stolen American identities. These workers then secured remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies, including Fortune 500 firms, illegally generating millions of dollars for the North Korean regime. Chapman operated a "laptop farm" from her home, making it appear the workers were based in the U.S. and helping ship equipment abroad.

The federal government has collected approximately $100 billion since the higher import duties were enacted. The president also mentioned using the funds to pay down the national debt, which is projected to rise under his new tax and spending legislation. This proposal comes as some companies begin passing tariff-related costs to consumers, and it would likely require new legislation from Congress to authorize the Treasury Department to issue direct payments.

          <p>This satirical piece from The Atlantic presents a fictional, first-person account from Donald Trump explaining his presence in the "Epstein files." In the parody, Trump portrays himself as a humble man obsessed only with tariffs and helping orphans, who was reluctantly dragged into Jeffrey Epstein's world by a mysterious Barack Obama. He comically misinterprets all events through the lens of his disinterest, claiming to be miserable at parties while trying to read about President McKinley. The essay lampoons the president's attempts to distance himself from Epstein, framing his involvement as part of a bizarre, convoluted conspiracy he never understood because he was too busy thinking about trade policy.</p>
