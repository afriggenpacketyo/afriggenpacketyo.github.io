          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected claims from Democratic lawmakers that Washington was retreating from its long-standing commitments to humanitarian assistance and human rights. Rubio argued that China does not do humanitarian aid, but rather predatory lending through its Belt and Road Initiative. He stated that there is no evidence that China has the capacity or will to replace the US in humanitarian assistance, food deliveries, or developmental assistance. Rubio also highlighted his recent travels to 18 countries in 18 weeks as evidence of continued US engagement.</p>

          <p>George Wendt, best known as Norm from "Cheers," died at 76. Wendt's performance suggested, took everything Norm had got. A bedraggled accountant (later unemployed, later a house painter), Norm spent his days getting the stuffing kicked out of him by life, then returned to Cheers to replace that stuffing with beer. The setting was a place people came to escape somewhere else. And that meant that the actors portraying those suds-drinking refugees had to portray that somewhere-else entirely through the strength of their performances.</p>

          <p>Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver has been charged with two counts of assault after a confrontation with officers outside an immigration detention center. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 during an oversight visit to the Delaney Hall detention center. McIver denies wrongdoing, calling the case "purely political," while leading congressional Democrats issued a statement saying the charge of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement "is extreme, morally bankrupt and lacks any basis in law or fact".</p>

          <p>China’s investments in Europe rose in 2024 for the first time in nine years, with Hungary reaffirming its position as the region’s leading hub for Chinese capital. The investments shot up 47 per cent from a year earlier, to €10 billion (US$11.23 billion). It marked the first rise since 2016, the year in which European governments’ serious concerns over Chinese investments first emerged. The purchase of Kuka, a German manufacturer of industrial robots and factory automation systems, by Chinese appliance maker Midea Group stoked fears that Beijing was hoovering up Europe’s critical technology companies.</p>

Lai is also faced with an opposition-controlled legislature that has blocked some of his key initiatives and called him a “dictator”.</p>

          <p>A BBC article explores the growing use of nicotine pouches among young people, particularly as a substitute for vaping. Johnpaul, a 16-year-old, shares his experience of using pouches to quit vaping, only to develop another addiction. Health experts warn that these pouches, which contain high levels of nicotine, are addictive and may have harmful side effects. The article also mentions concerns that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes could lead more young people to turn to nicotine pouches.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House. Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier. According to Original Sin, a new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden was unable to recognise Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney or to recall the names of key aides in his final year in office.</p>

          <p>The United States is on track to break its record debt level, potentially exceeding 117 percent of the economy's size by 2034. The Congressional Budget Office's projections indicate a sharp upward trajectory, further exacerbated by the Republican's proposed tax and spending bill. This bill would widen the gap, potentially reaching 129 percent of the economy by 2034. Elevated interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing, accelerating the debt's growth. Some experts worry that governments get into trouble when their debt becomes too high because bond holders become nervous about whether they can be paid back, which raises interest rates even more.</p>
