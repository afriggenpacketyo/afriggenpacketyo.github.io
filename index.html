          <p>A Cartier turquoise and diamond tiara, once owned by Nancy Astor, the first woman to hold a seat in the House of Commons, fetched Â£700,000 at a London auction. Astor, an American-born politician, represented Plymouth Sutton in Parliament from 1919 to 1945. Bonhams auction house noted this was the first time the tiara had been available since Lord Waldorf Astor, her husband, purchased it in 1930. Lady Astor famously wore the tiara to the premiere of Charlie Chaplin's film 'City Lights' in 1931, adding to its historical and cultural significance. The tiara's sale highlights the enduring appeal and value of rare jewelry with connections to notable figures. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump voiced his disappointment with Elon Musk's criticism of the House-passed tax and budget bill, questioning the future of their relationship. Musk, who recently left his government position, has called the bill an "abomination" due to its impact on federal deficits and the elimination of electric vehicle subsidies. Trump claimed Musk was involved in crafting the bill and only raised concerns after the EV provisions were removed. Musk responded on X, denying prior knowledge of the bill's details and criticizing the inclusion of wasteful spending, while defending the EV/solar incentive cuts. The disagreement raises questions about Republican unity on Trump's legislative agenda.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked a lawsuit filed by Mexico against U.S. gun manufacturers, a decision that favors the firearms industry. The case centered on whether Mexico could hold gunmakers accountable for violence caused by drug cartels using their products. The court unanimously rejected Mexico's argument that the lawsuit fell under an exception to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). The PLCAA generally shields gun companies from liability for the criminal misuse of their products. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion, stating that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted the unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is reintroducing its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a decision to discontinue the powertrain due to tightening fuel economy regulations. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis acknowledged the initial decision as a mistake and highlighted the return of the Hemi as part of a broader product turnaround plan. The decision reflects a shift in automakers' strategies amid slower-than-expected EV adoption and efforts by the Trump administration to ease regulations on internal combustion engines. The Hemi engine is expected to account for a significant portion of Ram 1500 sales, offering customers a choice between the Hemi and the more efficient Hurricane engine.</p>

These lawmakers are insisting that the Senate retain the House's increased state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, which is currently set at $40,000. They argue that raising the SALT cap is essential for providing tax relief to residents in high-cost-of-living areas. The representatives signal that they may not support the bill if the Senate reinstates the lower cap, highlighting the importance of the SALT issue to their constituents and the potential for dissent within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected Mexico's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, affirming the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields gunmakers from liability for the misuse of their products. Mexico argued that gunmakers knowingly aided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to straw purchasers who trafficked them to drug cartels. The court found that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted retail dealers' unlawful sale of weapons. The decision reinforces the legal protections afforded to the firearms industry under federal law.</p>
