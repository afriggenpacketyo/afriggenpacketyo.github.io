          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her unfair dismissal case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with the court determining she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut short her fill-in radio presenting stint due to her political views, race, and lobbying from pro-Israel groups, after she shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes. The court awarded her A$70,000 in damages, finding the ABC sacked her for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, while dismissing allegations of racial discrimination. The ABC apologized for its handling of the matter, acknowledging it had let down its staff and audiences, as Lattouf stated she was punished for her political opinion.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East, suggested that the leak of an initial intelligence assessment regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities following U.S. strikes was "treasonous." The assessment, reportedly from the U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but set it back by a few months. Witkoff assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, stating that no one is shooting at each other and the conflict is over. He also dismissed the possibility of Iran resuming its nuclear enrichment program within months.</p>

Correspondence reveals Metsola's outreach to the Chinese ambassador to the EU, Cai Run, marking a significant step toward revitalizing legislative dialogue. The move comes after years of clashes over issues ranging from human rights and trade to Taiwan and foreign meddling, though not everyone is pleased with the detente.</p>

          <p>California's Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on a $321.1 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12 billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funding, while reducing and delaying proposed cuts. The agreement includes a "poison pill" requiring legislators to pass a bill lessening environmental review requirements for building projects under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The budget also preserves funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants, and expands the California Film and Television Tax Credit, while anticipating future financial challenges and potential federal funding losses.</p>

Recent moves include expanding tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and gathering feedback on allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and a relatively opaque system have discouraged large-scale buying of mainland China assets.

Mamdani's victory is viewed as a litmus test for the Democratic Party as it seeks to refine its messaging after recent election losses.

          <p>A controversial proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was removed from a Republican tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. Senator Mike Lee (R–Utah) had proposed selling up to 3.3 million acres of public land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to address housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal didn’t meet the Byrd Rule, which prevents extraneous budget provisions. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, even as Lee vowed to continue the fight with revised proposals.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies reveals significant damage at three key Iranian nuclear sites—Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan—following U.S. airstrikes. The images show craters along access roads and at tunnel entrances at Fordow, along with destruction at the surface of the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center. At Natanz, craters believed to be caused by U.S. ordnance appear filled and covered with dirt, targeting underground centrifuge halls. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit, with American officials claiming the strikes severely set back Iran’s nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Democrats in New York City are choosing a nominee for mayor, a race seen as a proxy war between the party's left-wing and moderate factions. The primary is largely a battle between state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability, including free public buses and universal childcare, while Cuomo emphasizes his experience and moderate stance. The outcome of the race could indicate the type of leader Democrats are looking for during Donald Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment found that the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, indicated that the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities to be sealed off. It also suggested that some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. While President Trump claimed Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities had been "completely and totally obliterated," the assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure remains largely intact.</p>

Greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen by over half since 1990, mainly due to the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. While electric car sales are growing, and heat pump sales are up by more than half, electricity costs remain high, requiring government action to reduce prices and support cleaner energy adoption.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, using data from Europe’s Gaia space telescope. Researchers at the Changchun Observatory studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older counterparts. This extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study presents direct evidence that the galaxy’s star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study the Milky Way’s history.</p>
