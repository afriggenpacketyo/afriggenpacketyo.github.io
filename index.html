          <h2>Yale Alumni Criticize Treasury Secretary Bessent's Role in Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>A group of Yale University classmates penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, cautioning him against enabling what they perceive as the Trump administration's authoritarian tendencies. The letter, signed by 140 Yale alumni, accuses the administration of unconstitutional actions, including attacks on the media and conflicts of interest related to the Trumps' meme coins. Bessent responded, dismissing the letter as a politically motivated attack from close-minded progressives, and defending his service in the Trump Administration as an honor. The letter echoes a similar one sent to Steven Mnuchin in 2017 regarding Trump's reaction to the Charlottesville rally.</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles is reeling from a bizarre incident involving the destruction of over a dozen mature trees by a chainsaw-wielding individual.

This incident adds to the existing challenges faced by downtown L.A., including homelessness, crime, and the ongoing recovery from the pandemic.

          <p>Kristi Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, had her purse stolen while dining at a restaurant in downtown Washington D.C. The stolen purse contained sensitive items, including her driver's license, medication, apartment keys, blank checks, department badge, passport, and $3,000 in cash. The incident has drawn attention due to the irony of the top official responsible for national security becoming a victim of theft, and because of Noem's controversial public image, including past incidents involving her dog and a luxury watch.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claims to have saved billions in US government spending, but BBC Verify's analysis reveals a lack of supporting evidence for these claims. Doge's website lists substantial savings, but less than 40% are broken down with individual receipts, and errors have been identified in reported figures. Experts suggest that Doge may be overstating savings by counting projected spending over several years rather than direct savings from annual spending, which casts doubt on the true impact of the department's cost-cutting efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine, but his plea is seen as insufficient compared to Ronald Reagan's strategies. Trump's approach contrasts with Reagan's firm stance and avoidance of one-word pronouncements, instead employing humor and broader visions. Reagan's tactics, including military build-up and strategic messaging, are suggested as a more effective approach to dealing with Russia. The article suggests Trump should leverage his personal relationship with Putin and threaten consequences like increased oil sanctions or deployment of F-35s to Ukraine to achieve a peace deal.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, this article provides an overview of the major militant groups operating in the region, examining their objectives and connections to global jihadi networks. These groups, including The Resistance Front (TRF), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), aim to challenge Indian control over Kashmir and merge the region with Pakistan. Some have previously fought alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The militant landscape is fluid, with groups frequently changing allegiances, making the insurgency difficult to track and contain.</p>

          <p>While Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved $160 billion, a new analysis suggests that these cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The Partnership for Public Service estimates that putting federal employees on paid leave, rehiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity have contributed to the high cost. The White House disputes the analysis, defending DOGE's efforts to make government more efficient. The IRS is planning on cutting roughly 40% of its workforce, which could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade.</p>
