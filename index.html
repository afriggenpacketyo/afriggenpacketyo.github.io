          <p>A debate has emerged in China regarding a Communist Party cadre, Xie Qin, who faced disciplinary action for a drinking incident and is now being considered for promotion, igniting public anger over officials receiving second chances. State media has portrayed Xie Qin as a rehabilitation success story, but the public expresses frustration on social media, viewing it as rewarding misconduct. This situation is part of Beijing's broader strategy to motivate officials who are underperforming due to President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption efforts and economic challenges. Xie's case, involving unauthorized drinking and banqueting during a training session, exemplifies the issues at hand, as the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection publicizes rehabilitation cases. </p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a sharp rise in obesity, ranking first in Europe for rates of overweight and obese individuals, with experts citing poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies as contributing factors. High food price inflation reduces citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of cheap, processed foods high in sugar and low in nutritional value. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but faces criticism for overlooking broader economic struggles and failing to regulate unhealthy food marketing. Experts advocate for a nationwide free school meal program to address nutritional imbalances and provide access to healthy foods for low-income households.</p>

Hernandez won state titles in the girlsâ€™ triple jump and high jump and took second place in the long jump, despite facing intense scrutiny and demonstrations against her participation. The California Interscholastic Federation implemented new rules to address concerns, allowing cisgender girls beaten by a transgender competitor to be awarded the medal they would have claimed otherwise. While supporters praised Hernandez's resilience, critics denounced the policy change as insufficient and demanded a full ban on transgender athletes, while LGBTQ+ advocates criticized the rule change as discriminatory.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's ban on transgender women playing in women's football has begun, affecting 28 registered transgender women in England. Following the UK Supreme Court's ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex, the FA now only permits those born biologically female to play women's football at all levels. This ruling forces players like Billie Sky to stop playing competitive 11-a-side football, though she can still play informally. While some support the ban to protect the integrity of women's football, others argue it limits inclusion and safety for transgender women.</p>

While some recent domestic competitions in Japan have remained open to younger skaters, organizers express a willingness to support children of all ages.

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to its Penal Code, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons, marking the first significant change to its crime laws in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer categorized by labor requirements, allowing more time for guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law stipulates that inmates can be assigned "necessary work" or undergo "necessary guidance" tailored to their age, characteristics, and other factors. The new system includes 24 programs, such as Daily Care-Senior for elderly inmates and Addiction Recovery for drug abusers, with inmates being sent to prisons that can offer appropriate programs.</p>

          <p>South Korean women who played a crucial role in ousting former President Yoon Suk Yeol feel overlooked as the upcoming presidential election approaches, with equality for women largely ignored by the main candidates. Yoon gained power in 2022 by defending men who felt marginalized by feminism, and a third candidate with anti-feminist views is gaining traction. This has left many young women feeling that their voices are being erased and that progress towards gender equality is stalling. Despite their active participation in protests against Yoon, the current political climate suggests a potential rollback of women's rights.</p>

The article highlights the potential challenges in striking a trade agreement given these underlying tensions.

          <p>As Nayib Bukele marks six years as El Salvadorâ€™s president, his rule is characterized by contentious reforms and a crackdown on crime, leading to the detention of around 87,000 people. Critics argue that these measures have eroded civil liberties, while the government defends them as necessary for reducing gang violence. Recent actions include taxing foreign donations to NGOs and allegations of back-door dealings with gangs. Despite these controversies, Bukele remains popular due to the reduction of gang-related crime, leading to his reelection despite constitutional barriers.</p>
