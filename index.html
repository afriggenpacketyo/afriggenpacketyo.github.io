          <p>CureIS Healthcare, a managed care services company, has initiated a civil lawsuit against Epic Systems, a major electronic health record (EHR) provider, alleging a scheme to undermine CureIS's business.

          <p>A new book alleges that former President Joe Biden's aides covered up his 'physical deterioration' during his re-election campaign, even discussing the possibility of using a wheelchair. Biden's spokesperson has dismissed the claims, asserting that 'evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity'. The book cites anonymous sources and claims Biden's condition was so poor that aides sought to limit his walking distances and ensure he used handrails. Biden abruptly ended his re-election campaign after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump, with some party insiders blaming him for exiting too late.</p>

Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.

          <p>Despite public denials, an internal Israeli military analysis concludes that Palestinians in Gaza face widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are urgently restored. Israeli military officials have warned commanders that many areas of Gaza will run out of food within weeks. This assessment contrasts with the Israeli government's stance that the blockade does not pose a major threat to civilian life. The analysis highlights the urgency of the situation, with bakeries and charity kitchens closing and the UN's World Food Program running out of supplies. The Trump administration is reportedly working with Israel on a plan for private organizations to distribute food, but aid agencies have expressed concerns about its feasibility and safety.</p>

          <p>Tesla faces increasing competition as Slate Automotive, an Amazon-backed startup, gains traction with its low-cost electric pickup trucks. Slate's customizable trucks, priced at $25,000, offer a traditional design and have garnered over 100,000 reservations. This 'anti-Tesla' model contrasts with Tesla's Cybertruck, which has faced demand issues and is seen as less affordable and customizable. The rise of Slate Automotive presents a challenge to Tesla's dominance in the electric vehicle market, offering consumers a more accessible and conventional alternative.</p>

          <p>Victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires are facing a 17% emergency rate hike from State Farm, despite ongoing disputes over delayed, disputed, or dismissed claims. Homeowners expressed frustration with State Farm's handling of claims, citing issues with inspections, remediation, and lowball payouts. The state Insurance Commissioner approved the rate hike, citing the need to ensure State Farm's financial stability, but critics argue that it rewards the company for mishandling claims. Fire survivors are calling for investigations into State Farm's practices and accusing the insurer of failing to meet its legal obligations.</p>

New government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with additional roles created in other towns and cities. The goal is to decentralize decision-making and better reflect the country. The Labour government aims to reduce government running costs by 15% by the end of the decade, leading to reforms and job cuts within the civil service.</p>

The margins for AWS have been improving, and with continued investment into AI, they could get even better in the future. This growth suggests that Amazon's stock could be undervalued, presenting a potential opportunity for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is believed to be part of a 'negotiation' between the U.S. Justice Department and representatives of El Chapo’s son, Ovidio Guzmán López, who faces drug-smuggling charges in Chicago. The transfer may be related to Ovidio Guzmán's potential plea deal, which could include testifying in drug cases, and providing protection for his relatives.
