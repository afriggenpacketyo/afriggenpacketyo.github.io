        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to diversify its broadcast partnerships. Under the proposed three-year deals, NBC would acquire all Sunday night games and wild-card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix would secure rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million per year. ESPN is set to receive a new package valued at $550 million, including in-market games for five local teams and a new midweek national game package. These agreements, which see all major rights expiring after the 2028 season, reflect MLB's strategy to expand its reach and secure new revenue streams amidst a changing media landscape.

          <p>The Department of Justice released over 300 pages of transcripts and audio from its two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, conducted with limited immunity. Maxwell discussed her extensive connections, notably denying any inappropriate behavior by Donald Trump and dismissing a photo of Prince Andrew with an accuser as "fake." She also detailed her financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as not consistently sexual after 1999, and expressed skepticism regarding Epstein's official suicide finding, suggesting internal prison involvement if it was murder. This significant release follows mounting public and congressional pressure for transparency concerning the Epstein case files and related figures.</p>

          <p>Ether achieved a new record high, its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole hinting at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's comments led to approximately $120 million in ether short liquidations within an hour, propelling the cryptocurrency's price upward and causing related company shares to rebound. This surge highlights Ether's recent market leadership over Bitcoin, catalyzed by regulatory tailwinds and growing institutional interest in stablecoins, which predominantly utilize the Ethereum blockchain.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a significant modernization effort over the past decade, aiming to become a "world class" fighting force by 2049, comparable to the United States military. Analysts note the PLA's "remarkable improvements" in information warfare, mechanization, and strategic projection, acquiring advanced weapons and industrial support. This transformation is shifting global perceptions of China's military capabilities, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. The article suggests that an upcoming military parade for the 80th anniversary of Victory Day in September could offer further insight into the extent of these advances.</p>

Continuing to work before full retirement age can trigger the earnings test, leading to temporary benefit reductions. Medicare Part B premiums, especially Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts for high earners, are often automatically deducted, significantly shrinking monthly checks. Furthermore, federal income taxes can apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, surprising many recipients.

          <p>The FBI has raided the Maryland home of former National Security Adviser John Bolton as part of an investigation into whether he mishandled or shared classified material. President Donald Trump, who fired Bolton in 2019, publicly disavowed knowledge of the raid, calling Bolton a "lowlife." The investigation reportedly followed intelligence collected overseas by the CIA. The article notes the irony, given Bolton's past criticism of government secrecy and his punctilious nature, but also suggests his cockiness and extensive knowledge of secrets could lead to an unguarded moment. This event underscores the ongoing political tensions surrounding classified information.</p>

          <p>California and Texas, the two most populous U.S. states, are embroiled in an intense political battle over congressional redistricting that could significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas, with its Republican-majority legislature, redrew its maps to create five new Republican-favoring congressional seats. California lawmakers responded by voting to redraw their state's maps to boost Democratic representation by five seats, aiming to neutralize Texas's move. This mid-decade redistricting, which is legal unless racially motivated, highlights the partisan efforts to gain advantage ahead of next year's national midterm elections, despite criticism that it allows politicians to choose their voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks soared after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at upcoming interest rate cuts, but his Jackson Hole speech also offered a cautious long-term outlook, suggesting neutral rates might settle higher than in the 2010s. This implies that while short-term cuts are likely, borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans may not return to pre-pandemic lows, continuing to challenge the housing market. The Fed aims for a "Goldilocks balance" between unemployment and inflation, complicated by President Trump's tariffs, which Powell noted are beginning to push up prices. The article suggests that while the Fed can stabilize cyclical fluctuations, its ability to counter executive policies that destabilize the economy is limited. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vietnam has significantly expanded its island-building activities in the disputed Spratly Islands chain in the South China Sea, with a U.S. think tank reporting it could soon surpass China's scale of reclamation. Satellite imagery shows Vietnam has undertaken dredging and landfill work at eight new features since the start of the year, bringing all 21 Vietnamese-occupied sites to include artificial land. As of March 2025, Vietnam had created about 70% as much artificial land as China, with infrastructure, including munitions storage, appearing on newly expanded reefs. This development intensifies overlapping claims in the strategically vital waterway, which China claims almost entirely.</p>

          <p>Ron Turcotte, the Hall of Fame jockey renowned for riding Secretariat to the 1973 Triple Crown, has died at 84 from natural causes at his home in New Brunswick, Canada. Turcotte achieved widespread fame for Secretariat's record-setting 31-length victory in the Belmont Stakes, a record that still stands 52 years later. His illustrious career, spanning nearly two decades and over 3,000 wins, ended in 1978 after an accident left him paraplegic, yet he remained a dedicated advocate for disabled jockeys.

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court has issued favorable rulings for bars and their operators, allowing lawsuits seeking monetary compensation for COVID-19 restrictions to continue. The bars argue they were unfairly treated compared to restaurants, which were permitted to serve alcohol during state-mandated closures. The court's five Republican justices rejected arguments for dismissal, with Chief Justice Paul Newby emphasizing that small business owners faced immense uncertainty during the pandemic. While the court limited some claims, it affirmed the right of plaintiffs to present evidence that their constitutional right to earn a living was violated, keeping the litigation alive.

          <p>Serena Williams, the legendary tennis star, has openly discussed her use of weight-loss drugs, aiming to reduce the stigma associated with such medications. Williams, who lost 31 pounds over eight months, emphasized that it was not a shortcut and required intense training, but she felt her body was "missing something" after having children. While she has become a spokesperson for a company selling GLP-1 brands, her transparency is seen by some as a breakthrough in challenging stereotypes that these drugs are for "lazy" people. However, concerns remain about potentially belittling hard work and the focus on appearance over accomplishments.</p>

This grim declaration comes nearly two years into the armed conflict with Israel, with ongoing Israeli restrictions significantly limiting the flow of food and humanitarian aid.

Authorities continue their search for Emmanuel, having previously removed another 2-year-old child from the home and noting Jake Haro's prior conviction for willful child cruelty.

          <p>Netflix is making an unusual move by releasing its hit animated film, "KPop Demon Hunters," in theaters for sing-along screenings this weekend, potentially topping the box office. The film, already a viral streaming phenomenon, will be shown on over 1,750 screens in the U.S. and Canada, with many shows already sold out. Despite estimates suggesting it could gross $16 million to $22 million, Netflix will not release box office figures, adhering to its long-standing policy. This decision frustrates industry professionals and highlights the complex relationship between streamers and traditional exhibitors, as Netflix views theatrical releases primarily as marketing efforts for its subscriber base.</p>

Trump, who recently met Putin, acknowledged the leaders' strained relationship but committed to arranging a meeting, which he would join. Zelensky, while supportive of the initiative, is seeking robust, NATO-like security guarantees from Western allies to prevent future Russian aggression should a peace deal be reached. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, however, stated no meeting is planned, blaming Ukraine for a lack of flexibility in ongoing talks.
