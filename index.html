          <h2>Global Luxury Market Recovery Hindered by Multiple Economic Factors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 02:08:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury goods market is facing a challenging recovery, with major brands like LVMH reporting softer sales. Key headwinds include a sharp decline in the Japanese yen which previously fueled tourist spending, a potential U.S. sales spike that may be temporary due to looming tariffs, and necessary price increases by brands to offset these new costs. Additionally, product performance is mixed, with items like high-end jewelry and leather goods showing varied success across different companies, indicating a complex and divided market landscape.

          <p>Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts has been met with organized protests and significant local opposition. Residents and activists recall the contentious history of the Menie resort's construction on ecologically sensitive land and express frustration over the public cost of security for what is described as a private visit. While some locals cite employment benefits, many others feel Trump is unwelcome, pointing to unfulfilled development promises and his broader political actions, with protests planned at both his Aberdeenshire and Turnberry properties.</p>

          <p>As the United States implements trade tariffs, aid reductions, and visa restrictions affecting several African countries, China is strengthening its ties with the continent. Beijing recently announced an expansion of duty-free access for nearly all taxable products from 53 African nations, a move that contrasts sharply with Washington's policies. This has led many African nations to perceive China as a more dependable and advantageous partner, challenging the long-held U.S. belief that its humanitarian aid would secure unwavering goodwill and influence in the region.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are deciding the fate of 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT) in a large-scale recall election. The effort was initiated by citizens angered by the KMT-led majority bloc's actions, which include obstructing key legislation like the defense budget and passing reforms seen as favoring Beijing. The outcome could potentially shift the legislative balance of power back to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which currently lacks a majority, intensifying the political divide over the island's relationship with China.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation highlights severe side effects of dopamine agonist drugs like Ropinirole, prescribed for Parkinson's disease and other conditions. The article details cases where patients developed extreme impulse-control issues, including compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and coercive behavior, leading to devastating personal and familial consequences. One story describes a man who began spying on his wife and developed a pornography addiction, ultimately leading to his family's separation. Despite long-known risks, critics argue that warnings provided to patients and doctors remain inadequate.</p>

The suspension was automatically triggered after both players, following a club decision, skipped the MLS All-Star game. Mas called the punishment "draconian" and stated that the players did not understand why missing an exhibition match would lead to a suspension from a regular season game. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged it was a difficult decision but said the league had to enforce its long-standing policy.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York congressman George Santos has begun serving his 87-month federal prison sentence for fraud and identity theft. He surrendered to the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey, after being convicted of a wide range of offenses, including fabricating his biography to defraud donors, stealing from campaign supporters, and falsifying financial disclosures. Prosecutors stated he "made a mockery of our election system" by using donations for personal enrichment, including luxury goods and Botox treatments. He was expelled from the House of Representatives in late 2023.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner, Rebecca Dowdeswell, is facing a crucial hearing in her long-running trademark dispute with L'Oréal. The conflict began when she tried to re-register the trademark for her business, "nkd," and the cosmetics giant opposed it, claiming it would cause confusion with its "Naked" line of products by Urban Decay. After significant delays, an Intellectual Property Office hearing has been scheduled. Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 on legal fees, says she feels ready to continue her fight against the global firm.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that Russia is recruiting 18-year-olds as contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine, with at least 245 teenagers of that age confirmed killed. This practice contradicts President Putin's promises that young conscripts would not be sent to the front lines. A change in rules now allows any 18-year-old who has finished school to sign a professional contract, bypassing mandatory service. Attracted by large cash bonuses and patriotic propaganda in schools, these young men are joining the army, often with tragic consequences.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable boom for insects like ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm conditions led to a surge in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species, a positive contrast to the previous year's low numbers. However, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian populations next year and that the long-term trend for flying insects remains one of decline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago and Cook County over their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit had alleged that local laws, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally thwarted federal immigration enforcement. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that the policies do not improperly regulate federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor praised the ruling, stating it affirms the city's ordinance is lawful and supports public safety.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the history and impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in the late 1940s amid the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence. The exhibit details the story of the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to testify, and how the anti-Communist fervor ruined numerous careers. It also highlights how blacklisted individuals like Dalton Trumbo continued to work under pseudonyms, eventually helping to erode the blacklist's power over the following decades.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man from Whittier, California, has been arrested on federal fraud charges for allegedly running an investment scam that targeted people on dating apps. Prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd used platforms like Tinder and Hinge to meet victims, then lied about being a successful financial manager to convince them to invest money with him. He allegedly collected over $2 million through cash, wire transfers, and payment apps, which he then used for personal expenses, including a payment on a Lexus. He now faces multiple counts of wire fraud.</p>
