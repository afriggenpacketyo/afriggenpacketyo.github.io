          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene struck western North Carolina, recovery efforts in some mountain towns remain significantly delayed. In communities like Swannanoa, residents and business owners express frustration over the slow pace of federal and state aid, noting that debris still litters the area and essential services like the grocery store and post office have not reopened. While more resourceful areas like Asheville have seen progress, thousands across the region are still displaced, relying on rental assistance or temporary housing. Despite the hardships, the disaster has fostered a stronger sense of community, with neighbors actively helping one another.</p>

          <p>Technology consultancy Accenture is implementing a restructuring strategy that prioritizes artificial intelligence, which includes plans to dismiss employees who cannot be effectively reskilled in AI technologies. CEO Julie Sweet stated that while the company's primary strategy is to upskill its current workforce, it will be "exiting" staff on a compressed timeline for whom retraining is not a viable option. This move is part of an $865 million business optimization program aimed at saving over $1 billion. Concurrently, Accenture is actively hiring, having increased its AI and data professionals from 40,000 in 2023 to 77,000 in 2025.</p>

          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery for accepting money to make pro-Russian statements while he was a member of the European Parliament. The charges, spanning from December 2018 to July 2019, involved Gill making statements supportive of Russia's narrative regarding Ukraine in parliament and news outlets. The prosecution stated he was tasked by Ukrainian politician Oleg Voloshyn, a member of a pro-Russian party, in exchange for cash payments. Gill's defense barrister acknowledged that a prison sentence is expected when he is sentenced in November.</p>

          <p>Retired money manager Howard Rubin, 70, and his former assistant were arrested on charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges Rubin operated a trafficking network, spending at least $1 million to facilitate encounters in a rented Manhattan penthouse converted into a "sex dungeon." Prosecutors claim Rubin brutalized women beyond their consent, causing injuries, and used non-disclosure agreements to threaten them against seeking legal recourse. Rubin, a former trader at Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch, gained notoriety in the 1980s for unauthorized trades detailed in the book "Liar's Poker."</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a nationwide ban. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture, with American investors like Oracle holding a majority stake, and limits Chinese parent company ByteDance's ownership to less than 20%. Under the deal, Oracle will host American user data and review the app's code for security, while TikTok's recommendation algorithm will be copied and retrained solely on U.S. user data.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations General Assembly with a defiant speech, vowing that Israel "must finish the job" against Hamas in Gaza, even as representatives from dozens of countries walked out in protest. During his address, which his office announced would be broadcast via loudspeakers into Gaza, Netanyahu sent messages to hostages and warned remaining Hamas leaders. He used a map to visually cross off threats he claimed Israel had neutralized over the past year and thanked President Trump for his support. The speech occurred amid growing international isolation for Israel, with several nations recently recognizing Palestinian statehood.</p>

The abuse was discovered after she was sent home for pinching children at one of the nurseries.

The announcement has drawn concern from scientists and medical groups, who note that no high-quality study has proven causation and that acetaminophen is often the only approved painkiller for pregnant women.

          <h2>Million-Year-Old Skull Found in China May Reshape Human Evolution Timeline</h2>

          <p>A new digital reconstruction of a crushed, million-year-old skull discovered in China suggests that the human lineage may have diverged from ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than previously believed. The study, published in the journal Science, found that the skull, known as Yunxian 2, exhibits a mix of traits from both the early human forerunner Homo erectus and later species like Homo sapiens. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that early humans dispersed primarily from Africa, suggesting East Asia played a more significant role in hominin evolution. While some experts find the research provocative, others caution that more evidence is needed to confirm these potentially transformative conclusions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has seized more than $220 million worth of cocaine in a series of recent drug interdictions in the Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Cutter Midgett intercepted four alleged smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America, seizing over 21,000 pounds of cocaine. In a separate operation, the Cutter Diligence seized another 8,700 pounds of cocaine from a boat north of Panama. The Coast Guard released an image showing one of the alleged drug boats on fire a day after its seizure, though the cause of the fire was not specified.</p>

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, held steady at an annual rate of 2.9% in August, aligning with economists' expectations. The headline inflation rate saw a slight increase to 2.7%, while personal income and spending both rose more than anticipated. These figures suggest that President Trump's tariffs have had a limited impact on consumer prices so far. The stable inflation reading is unlikely to alter the central bank's current trajectory, with policymakers still anticipating two more interest rate reductions before the end of the year.

The festival, which originated in 1818 as a harvest celebration, features large beer tents, fairground rides, parades, and traditional Swabian food.

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, rose by approximately 5% following President Trump's announcement of a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The tariff, effective October 1, is intended to protect domestic manufacturers from what the administration calls unfair foreign competition. According to a Bank of America analysis, Paccar's domestically produced trucks cost more than those made by competitors in Mexico. The new tariff is expected to address this price disparity, placing Paccar in a more advantageous market position. (not investment advice)</p>

In collaboration with IBM, the bank combined classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, resulting in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of bond price predictions. This enhancement allows traders to better estimate the likelihood of a trade being filled at a quoted price, which can lead to increased margins and greater market liquidity. The trial provides the first empirical evidence that quantum computers can solve practical, complex problems in finance, signaling a new frontier for the industry.</p>

A suspension would prevent Israel's national team from continuing its World Cup qualifying campaign and exclude Israeli clubs from European competitions.

          <p>The UK government, under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is proposing a compulsory digital ID scheme aimed at curbing illegal working. The system would use smartphone technology to provide authoritative proof of a person's identity and their right to work in the UK, including their name, photo, and residency status. Ministers claim the digital ID will be mandatory for right-to-work checks by the end of the current parliament, arguing it will reduce a key "pull factor" for migrants arriving illegally. Critics question the plan's effectiveness, arguing it will not stop the black economy where checks are not performed, and note that illegal working persists in EU countries with long-standing ID schemes.</p>
