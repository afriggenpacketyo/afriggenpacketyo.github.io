          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while speaking at Utah Valley University, prompting a large-scale manhunt for the killer. Kirk, a prominent figure and founder of Turning Point USA, was known for his right-wing activism and close ties to Donald Trump. Trump expressed profound sadness at Kirk's death, highlighting his significant influence among American youth and ordering flags flown at half-mast. The incident occurred during Kirk's 'American Comeback Tour' as he was addressing approximately 3,000 attendees, drawing national attention to political violence.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores how the erosion of established geopolitical rules is increasingly impacting financial markets, challenging conventional economic predictions. The author reflects on discussions from a Nobel Meeting in Economic Sciences, highlighting the need to distill major themes in economics amidst global uncertainties. The piece suggests that traditional economic models may struggle to account for the unpredictable nature of contemporary international relations, urging a re-evaluation of how geopolitical shifts influence market stability. This analysis underscores the complex interplay between global politics and economic forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article highlights the enduring pain and recovery journeys of individuals like Ilona Lüth and Patricia Gerstendörfer, who found solace and purpose in suicide support groups after losing loved ones. Patricia, who once contemplated suicide herself, now leads a group in Berlin, emphasizing the importance of shared experience and purpose in healing. Global suicide rates, particularly among men, are discussed, alongside the 'Werther effect' and the less-researched 'Papageno effect,' which suggests positive media portrayals can aid prevention. Despite a global decline since 1990, some countries, including Germany, have seen recent increases, underscoring the ongoing need for improved support services.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's attendance at China's parade, marking his first multilateral diplomatic event since 2012 and first China visit since 2019, has raised questions about potential hidden messages regarding missile capabilities. Standing alongside Chinese and Russian leaders, the trio's presence symbolized a strengthening alliance and increased strategic coordination. Following the parade, Kim and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a bilateral summit, pledging to enhance cooperation in international and regional affairs. This high-profile engagement underscores evolving geopolitical dynamics and North Korea's strategic positioning.</p>

          <p>Emily Thornberry has announced her withdrawal from the Labour deputy leadership race, leaving four candidates to vie for the position. Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, had secured only 13 MP nominations, falling far short of the required 80. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is currently the frontrunner with 116 nominations, while Lucy Powell is her closest rival. The contest is seen as an 'unwelcome distraction' for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, highlighting internal party tensions and the debate over leadership independence and direction.</p>

          <p>US pharmaceutical giant Merck (MSD in Europe) has canceled a planned £1 billion expansion of its UK operations, attributing the decision to the government's perceived lack of investment in the life sciences sector. This move will result in 125 job losses and a shift of research to the US, dealing a significant blow to the UK's pharmaceutical industry. Industry experts warn that other major companies might follow suit, citing concerns over the UK's competitiveness and the NHS's spending on medicines.

          <p>Facing an industry slump, luxury brands are strategically diversifying into more accessible, lower-priced products like $160 lipsticks and $1,400 accessories to attract new consumers. Louis Vuitton's new beauty collection exemplifies this trend, aiming to engage a broader, younger demographic without diluting core luxury offerings. This strategy, seen during past industry downturns, seeks to foster brand loyalty among aspirational consumers who may later upgrade to higher-ticket items. Brands must carefully balance broadening appeal with maintaining exclusivity to avoid devaluing their prestigious labels while adapting to economic pressures.</p>

          <p>Revelations concerning Lord Peter Mandelson's friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein have caused a stir in Westminster, leading to calls for his resignation as the UK ambassador to the US. Reports indicate Mandelson exchanged over 100 emails with Epstein, including one where he encouraged Epstein to 'fight for early release.' Downing Street faces questions about the vetting process for his appointment. Mandelson has stated he relied on assurances of Epstein's innocence that proved 'horrendously false.' This controversy highlights ongoing political ethics debates and the scrutiny of public figures' past associations.</p>

          <p>Global equities are rallying, with benchmarks like the MSCI All Country World Index and Japan's Nikkei 225 hitting fresh record highs, fueled by easing inflation pressures, resilient corporate earnings, and expectations for US rate cuts.

Oracle's strong outlook for AI-related revenue further amplifies confidence in the tech-led rally. However, concerns about long-term interest rates and the impact of recent US tariffs temper some of the market optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the transatlantic relationship is undergoing a structural rupture, suggesting that even without Donald Trump, a return to past kinship is unlikely. The author posits that the relationship will reduce to 'transactions of convenience' or devolve into a world of competing empires, with Europe caught between US and Russian ambitions. The article criticizes European leaders for 'self-humiliation' in dealing with Trump, advocating for Europe to develop strategic autonomy and diversify trade relations. It warns against clinging to a 'delusional' hope of restoring past stability.</p>

Since 2021, geologists have identified over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, bolstering the nation's energy security and resource structures. These efforts are driven by supply-chain security concerns and booming demand from new tech development amid geopolitical tensions. The findings underscore China's intensified drive to dominate critical mineral supply chains and reduce reliance on imports, reinforcing its economic and strategic autonomy.</p>

Harry had previously expressed a desire for reconciliation, stating, 'Life is precious,' and channels of communication had reportedly opened. The meeting, lasting about 50 minutes, signals a shift in tone, though a full family reconciliation, particularly with Prince William, remains uncertain.</p>
