        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spot gold prices surged to an unprecedented $4,000, primarily driven by heightened safe-haven demand amidst global economic and political uncertainties. Factors contributing to this rally include the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the resignation of France's prime minister, and lingering U.S. tariff-led economic concerns. This occurred as Asia-Pacific stock markets showed mixed performance, while New Zealand's central bank implemented a significant 50 basis point interest rate cut to bolster its struggling economy.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. It is currently far from land but is expected to strengthen into a hurricane and approach the northern Leeward Islands by late Thursday or Friday. A tropical storm watch is in effect for several Caribbean islands, with forecasts predicting up to four inches of rain and life-threatening surf and rip currents. This development follows Hurricanes Humberto and Imelda, though this season has been relatively quiet for U.S. landfalls.</p>

While expected to remain offshore and weaken later in the week, Priscilla's dangerous swells are impacting coastal areas, posing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Moisture from the hurricane may also bring heavy rainfall and flash flood risks to the U.S. Desert Southwest by late week.</p>

          <p>Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon has been reportedly fined $100,000 for a sideline altercation with running back Emari Demercado. The incident occurred after Demercado fumbled before scoring a potential 72-yard touchdown, a mistake that contributed to the team's 22-21 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Gannon, who apologized for letting the moment get the better of him, made brief physical contact with Demercado. This marks the first NFL head coach fine for a player altercation since Bruce Arians in 2022.</p>

          <p>Dolly Parton's sister, Freida Parton, has publicly asked fans to pray for the country music icon, who recently postponed a Las Vegas residency due to unspecified health challenges. Parton, 79, cited the need for "a few procedures" and insufficient rehearsal time for the delayed December concerts. While the exact nature of her health issues remains private, she previously withdrew from a Dollywood event due to a kidney stone. Freida expressed optimism, stating Dolly is strong and loved, expecting her to be fine.</p>

          <p>Charlie Mackesy, author of the best-selling "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse," revealed that the completion of his new book, "Always Remember," was delayed by six years after his iPad containing many ideas and drawings was stolen from his car. The incident forced him to reconstruct significant portions from memory. Mackesy also experienced profound personal losses during the book's creation, including his mother and his dog, Barney, who inspired the Mole character. Despite setbacks, he remains committed to connecting with people through his art.</p>

          <p>A REACH medical helicopter crashed on a Sacramento freeway, Highway 50, critically injuring the three crew members aboard: a pilot, nurse, and paramedic. The helicopter, returning to its dispatch point after transporting a patient, experienced an "in-air emergency." Miraculously, no vehicles on the freeway were involved in the crash, which occurred in the center of the road. Bystanders and fire crews assisted in rescuing a trapped crew member. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation by federal agencies.</p>

          <p>U.S. air travelers are facing a second day of widespread flight delays and cancellations, as the ongoing government shutdown exacerbates a shortage of air traffic controllers. Key airports in cities like Nashville, Dallas, Chicago, and Newark are significantly affected, with staffing levels sometimes dropping to 50%. Air traffic controllers, deemed essential workers, are working without pay, leading to increased stress and sick calls. This situation mirrors the 2019 shutdown, which saw similar air travel disruptions and ultimately prompted its resolution.</p>

          <p>This article explains the U.S. Insurrection Act, a federal law empowering the president to deploy military forces domestically to quell uprisings, which President Trump has threatened to invoke. The act, an amalgamation of statutes from 1792-1871, allows troops to perform civilian law enforcement duties in emergencies, typically prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act. Historically used sparingly since the 1960s, its potential invocation raises concerns about civil liberties and federal overreach, particularly as courts and governors resist federal military deployments in cities like Portland.</p>

Colorado maintains the ban regulates harmful, ineffective medical treatments, not speech. Several justices expressed skepticism about the state's interpretation of the law, suggesting potential viewpoint discrimination.
