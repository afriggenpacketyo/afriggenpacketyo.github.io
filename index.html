          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague emphasizes increased defense spending and troop readiness, posing significant challenges for Germany's military. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, aiming to make it Europe's strongest conventional army. However, achieving the NATO target of 5% GDP spending on defense by 2035 faces internal opposition within the German government. The summit also addresses the need for additional troops in Europe, potentially requiring Germany to recruit tens of thousands of soldiers, raising questions about conscription and the potential withdrawal of US troops. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are backing an amendment to block the government's proposed changes to the benefits system, which aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits by £5 billion annually by 2030. The MPs cite concerns about the bill's potential to increase poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden defends the bill, highlighting the projected doubling of long-term sickness and disability benefit recipients. The amendment's success remains uncertain, but the significant Labour support underscores the potential parliamentary challenges to the welfare reforms.</p>

          <p>Boy and girl scouts in Kyoto participated in the annual harvest of "Ofuku Ume" plums at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine, a tradition believed to bring good luck in the New Year. Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, helped pluck the fully grown plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. These plums are later pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, which is used to make a tea that is consumed on New Year's Day for good health and to ward off illness. The scouts expressed their enjoyment in participating in this cultural event.</p>

          <p>A recent report on improving American health, led by US health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, has been criticized for omitting the two leading causes of death for American children: gun violence and road traffic accidents. The report focuses on obesity, mental health, and chronic disease, while neglecting the disproportionately high rates of firearm-related deaths and traffic fatalities among children in the United States compared to other developed countries. The omission raises concerns about the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the proposed health strategy.</p>

This decline reflects growing safety concerns among Japanese expatriate communities, compounded by economic challenges in China. The attack, which resulted in the death of a Chinese bus attendant who intervened to help the Japanese victims, has led to increased security measures at Japanese schools in China. The upcoming 80th anniversary of the end of World War II may further exacerbate public sentiment toward Japanese nationals.</p>

Google, which controls over 90% of the UK search market, has expressed concerns that the proposed changes could have significant implications for businesses and consumers.

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe and promote political integration on the continent. With 32 member states, NATO operates as a collective security alliance, providing mutual defense against external threats, as outlined in Article 5. The alliance's role has evolved since the end of the Cold War, with former Warsaw Pact countries joining and a renewed focus on security in light of Russia's war against Ukraine. NATO's open-door policy allows any European country to join if it can contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities has reignited debates over Tehran's nuclear program, with Trump reportedly disregarding US intelligence assessments. The US intelligence community has consistently concluded that Iran has not built atomic bombs, a view at odds with Israel and Iran hawks. Trump's willingness to listen to Israel and his skepticism of the CIA have led to concerns that decisions are being made without considering expert opinions. This approach echoes past intelligence failures, such as the miscalculation of Saddam Hussein's WMD program.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, combined with US military strikes, may give Chinese airlines a competitive advantage over Western rivals. Western airlines are largely avoiding Iranian airspace, but they remain barred from Russian airspace, which Chinese companies continue to use. This situation provides Chinese airlines with more flexibility and potentially shorter flight times for routes between China and Europe. The developments could widen the existing competitive gap that Chinese airlines have over others.</p>

The island includes a ruined castle, a working farm, and holiday accommodations. The Gully family has called the island home since 1945, after the Dowager Viscountess Selby purchased it. The castle, built in 1911 by a New Zealand-born adventurer, fell into disrepair in the 1980s, but the island continues to operate as a wildlife haven and tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Germany faces potential tax hikes and increased debt as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target of 5% of GDP. While Germany spent approximately 2% of its GDP on defense in 2024, reaching the 5% target would require substantial additional expenditures. Experts suggest that financing these expenses may necessitate loans, budget cuts, and tax increases.

          <p>A Liverpool MP, Ian Byrne, has cautioned that a weakened Hillsborough Law without a duty of candour for public officials would fail to gain support from the families of victims. Byrne has written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, urging him not to drop the obligation for truthfulness in major inquiries. He fears that a draft version of the bill lacks key pledges, including the duty of candour. The Hillsborough Law seeks to ensure public bodies cooperate with investigations into major disasters, and Byrne argues that any redrafts must not compromise this objective.</p>
