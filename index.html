          <p>Several British newspapers are covering various topics, including allegations against Prince Andrew, Angela Rayner's boyfriend's lobbying work, and Kemi Badenoch's oil and gas extraction plans. Concerns about the black market for weight loss jabs are also highlighted, along with a poll suggesting many adults wouldn't fight for Britain. Shirley Ballas discusses her stalking ordeal, while The Mail on Sunday mocks a trigger warning for a loud bell at the Royal Opera House. The Sunday Times reports evidence that Prince Andrew maintained contact with Jeffrey Epstein longer than he admitted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tyler Glasnow pitched a stellar game for the Dodgers, carrying a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, but ultimately suffered a 6-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks due to a lack of offensive support. Despite Glasnow's strong performance, the Dodgers' offense struggled, going 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position and leaving eight runners on base. The loss shrinks the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just one game as the Padres beat the Twins. Glasnow's ERA is low, but he has not gotten the wins to show for it.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, founder of Tron, envisions a future where Tron's transaction volume surpasses Swift's within five years, estimating Tron's 2025 transaction volume at US$8 trillion. He highlights Tron's ability to facilitate transactions in seconds, contrasting it with Swift's slower processing times. Sun's ambition reflects the increasing prominence of the Tron blockchain in global stablecoin transactions, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the US dollar. He anticipates Tron's transaction volume could surge to US$300-400 trillion, potentially exceeding Swift's volume by 10 to 100 times.</p>

          <p>Across Mexico, thousands of people participated in protests to raise awareness about the country's widespread enforced disappearances, demanding government action to address the crisis. Relatives, friends, and activists marched in cities like Mexico City and Guadalajara, calling for justice for the over 130,000 missing individuals, most of whom disappeared since 2007. Drug cartels, organized crime groups, and security forces are implicated in these disappearances, with many victims forcibly recruited or murdered. Affected families have formed search teams, known as "buscadores", who risk their lives searching for mass graves.</p>

          <p>President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia has cancelled his planned trip to China due to "domestic dynamics" and a desire to directly monitor the situation amidst ongoing protests. The Chinese embassy in Indonesia issued a security warning to its citizens, urging them to take precautions and avoid protest areas. Prabowo was scheduled to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin and the Victory Day military parade in Beijing. The cancellation suggests internal pressures within Indonesia are taking precedence over international engagements.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles city councilmember, Ysabel Jurado, is opposing Home Depot's plans to open a new location in Eagle Rock, citing the retailer's alleged complicity with immigration enforcement operations. This opposition stems from recent raids at a Westlake Home Depot, where federal agents deployed tear gas and arrested several people. Jurado accuses Home Depot of remaining silent and prioritizing profit over the rights of working people. Home Depot denies prior notification of ICE operations and asserts compliance with federal and local regulations. The East Area Progressive Democrats have launched a campaign to block the new Home Depot location.</p>

          <p>Beer sales in Germany are declining, but non-alcoholic varieties are gaining popularity, with sales more than doubling since 2013. Overall beer sales have slumped by 6.3% in the first half of 2025, reaching their lowest level in over 30 years. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting alcohol-free beer at sporting events as a healthy alternative to energy drinks. While full-strength beer remains dominant, a shift towards health-consciousness is influencing consumption habits, with people increasingly opting for alcohol-free beverages in between alcoholic ones.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, years after the series' creator, Hideo Kojima, left the company. The split between Kojima and Konami in 2015 left the series directionless, but the remake signals a return to console games for Konami. The game is praised for remaining true to the original, with improved graphics and audio. The remake is also a faithful recreation and the director expressed a desire to move on from Metal Gear, it is a game true to the original.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are increasingly facing abuse and intimidation from other road users, with instructors reporting daily instances of aggressive behavior. Incidents range from tailgating and flashing headlights to verbal abuse and physical assault. Many instructors are installing dashcams to capture evidence of such behavior, and police have powers to address aggressive driving. Authorities urge drivers to show more empathy and kindness towards learners, remembering their own experiences or considering how they would feel if a loved one was being intimidated.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show called "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of "Love Island," "Married at First Sight," and "Survivor." Couples meet for five minutes before being matched by experts, have a fake wedding, and then must cope with being stranded on a remote tropical island. The show aims to discover if love can thrive in isolation by stripping away superficiality. It features slightly older contestants, averaging around 30, who are genuinely seeking a partner and offers a way to "cut through the rubbish of typical dating".</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, documenting the Norman invasion of England, will be closed to the public in France ahead of its planned move to London. The French art world is expressing strong opposition, fearing the 1,000-year-old tapestry is too fragile for transport. A petition against the loan has garnered 60,000 signatures, with critics concerned about potential damage from vibrations during the journey. The tapestry is scheduled to be displayed at the British Museum from next autumn until July 2027, in exchange for treasures from Sutton Hoo and the Lewis chess pieces traveling to Normandy.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the UK are employing drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spruce bark beetle, which poses a significant threat to the UK's forests. The beetles have been spreading across Europe, killing millions of spruce trees. Drones survey forests for signs of infestation, while sniffer dogs detect the beetles by scent. The team also uses models originally designed to track nuclear fallout to predict the beetle's spread, and as a result, the UK has eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in the east and south east.</p>

While body donation is essential for medical research, for-profit brokers have been accused of disrespecting the dead and exploiting vulnerable people. Unlike the UK, the US has no law banning the sale of body parts, leading to the export of cadavers globally. Some advocate for stricter regulations, such as emulating organ donation policies or promoting altruistic donation, while others suggest virtual reality may reduce the need for cadavers.</p>
