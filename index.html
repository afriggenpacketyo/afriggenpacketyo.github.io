            <p>A federal judge admonished the Department of Justice for non-compliance with an order to facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis ordered expedited discovery and depositions, expressing "no tolerance for gamesmanship". The Justice Department stated it would facilitate the man's return if he arrived at a port of entry. The judge gave both sides two weeks to complete fact-finding, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him.</p>

            <p>Nvidia expects to incur $5.5 billion in charges after the U.S. government tightened export rules to China. The restrictions require licenses for exporting the H20 AI chip, a popular product in China. The move comes amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Nvidia's value took a hit earlier in the year when a Chinese AI app, DeepSeek, was built at a fraction of the cost of other chatbots. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has given the Trump administration two weeks to submit evidence on how it is trying to return a Maryland man who officials have conceded was wrongly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis accused government officials of inaction in the case of Salvadoran national Kilmar Ábrego García, warning "there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship". The Supreme Court has ordered the administration to "facilitate" the 29-year-old's release, though El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said on a visit to the White House on Monday he did not "have the power" to return him.</p>

            <p>Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland will travel to El Salvador and attempt to visit Kilmar Ábrego García, a constituent whose deportation and incarceration in the Central American country, he warns, has tipped the United States into a constitutional crisis. Despite the US supreme court last week saying the Trump administration must “facilitate” his return to the United States, the president refuses to do so. He hopes to learn of Ábrego García’s condition and convey it to his family, who also live in the state he represents.</p>

            <p>A study has found that the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June. Researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban. The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, according to University College London (UCL) research.</p>
