          <p>An explosion at a construction site in Tokyo has left ten people with minor injuries after a maintenance vehicle caught fire. Police suspect a gas leak from a damaged pipe during foundation work may have triggered the blast. The victims, ranging from their 20s to 70s, included construction workers and nearby residents, some of whom complained of smoke inhalation. The incident caused damage to windows and shutters of adjacent buildings, prompting an emergency call reporting the sound of an explosion.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has allocated 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer, aiming to counter the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. Separately, Japan lodged a protest with China over unnotified maritime scientific research within its exclusive economic zone, after a Chinese survey vessel appeared to drop a cable near Okinotori Island. Additionally, the government plans to spread soil from near the Fukushima nuclear plant on government grounds to demonstrate its safety for public works projects.

          <p>High-end jewellery designs are incorporating hidden mechanisms and subtle details to create personal narratives for wearers. Swiss jewellery house GÃ¼belin integrates rubies into less visible areas of their creations, reflecting a commitment to ingenuity and sentiment. Other designers are using hidden gems, engraving, and even personal items like hair to add emotional resonance to their pieces. These subtle details transform rings and necklaces into symbols of meaning, memory, and artistry, providing a private connection for the wearer.</p>
