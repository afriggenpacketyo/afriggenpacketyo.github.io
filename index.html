          <p>Moody's Investors Service downgraded the United States' credit rating, citing a decade-long increase in government debt and interest payments exceeding those of similarly rated nations.  The downgrade to Aa1 from AAA reflects concerns about the country's fiscal trajectory and lack of political consensus on deficit reduction.  This aligns Moody's with S&P and Fitch, which have also lowered the US credit rating.</p>
