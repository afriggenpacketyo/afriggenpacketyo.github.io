          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amidst Electric Vehicle Boom</h2>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge of over 18% during their Hong Kong trading debut, fueled by investor confidence in the company's capacity to capitalize on the burgeoning electric vehicle market. CATL's IPO successfully raised HK$35.7 billion, earmarked primarily for the construction of a new factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive giants like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing increased scrutiny and potential trade complications from the U.S. and EU, CATL's strategic focus remains on expanding its presence in Europe and emerging regions, where EV sales penetration is still relatively low. The article suggests that CATL's growth in China is expected to decelerate due to already high sales penetration, making Europe a critical market for future expansion.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Ritchie was executed by lethal injection in Indiana for the 2000 fatal shooting of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney, marking the state's second execution in 15 years after a hiatus due to lethal drug shortages. Ritchie, who was 20 at the time of the crime, expressed remorse for his actions, which led to the death of the 31-year-old officer and father of two. His attorneys argued for clemency, citing his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, childhood lead exposure, and subsequent brain damage, which they claimed impaired his decision-making abilities. Despite these arguments and appeals to the Supreme Court, Republican Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ritchie's clemency bid, and the execution proceeded, amidst criticism of Indiana's secretive death penalty proceedings and lack of media witnesses.</p>

The Lee County Sheriffâ€™s Office Agriculture Unit responded to a call from a ranch regarding animal cruelty, discovering the calf with multiple gunshot wounds, leading to its euthanasia. The cow's owner stated that Trinh had previously expressed anger about livestock crossing the fence and had threatened to shoot the animals. Detectives located the alleged weapon in a shed on Trinh's property, and he faces charges of animal cruelty and grand theft of a commercial farm animal.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Canada have issued their strongest condemnation yet of Israel's military actions in Gaza, demanding an end to the offensive, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims is necessary to destroy Hamas and rescue hostages. These nations argue that the current level of human suffering is intolerable and that Israel's response is disproportionate to the initial attacks by Hamas on October 7, 2023. Netanyahu has responded by asserting that these countries are rewarding the genocidal attack on Israel and inviting further atrocities, while insisting that the war will only end if Hamas returns the hostages, lays down its arms, and agrees to demilitarization.</p>

Governor Jeff Landry has demanded answers about how the escape occurred, while officials have cautioned residents to be vigilant and report any sightings of the escapees.

          <p>Portugal's recent general election, the third in three years, has failed to produce a decisive outcome, leaving the country with another minority government led by the center-right Democratic Alliance. This outcome perpetuates a period of political instability, as the Democratic Alliance will be dependent on the support of opposition parties to govern. Adding to the uncertainty is the significant rise in support for the hard-right populist party Chega, which has shaken up the traditional balance of power. Corruption scandals and concerns over immigration and housing have fueled the rise of Chega, which now holds the same number of seats as the center-left Socialists.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their fourth consecutive loss, falling to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a game marked by poor pitching and defensive miscues. The Dodgers' pitching struggles have been exacerbated by injuries to key starters, while inconsistent offense and shaky defense have further contributed to the team's woes. Despite home runs from Mookie Betts and Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' overall performance was lackluster, leading to increased pressure on the team to improve their pitching and defensive consistency. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the need for better execution and starting games with more focus.</p>

          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their young daughter from her father, a convicted child sexual offender, has criticized a government bill aimed at helping others in similar situations. The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment to remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles, but only if they have abused their own children. The family expressed disappointment that the law does not automatically remove parental responsibility in all cases of serious child sexual offenses, requiring families like theirs to still navigate the Family Court system. The government has stated that it will continue to refine the law to ensure it provides adequate protection for children.</p>

A weakened Ukraine would leave Europe vulnerable, impacting the U.S. economy and emboldening adversaries like China, Iran, and North Korea.

Meanwhile, the UK, France, and Canada have issued a strong warning to Israel over its military operations in Gaza, condemning the humanitarian situation and calling for an immediate ceasefire.

These allegations come as the center announces its upcoming season, which includes some nonunion casts, a move that has divided artists about performing at the center under Trump's leadership. The Kennedy Center had been under the direction of Deborah F. Rutter, whom Trump fired when he took control of the center in February, after purging its formerly bipartisan board of Biden appointees, ousting its chairman, the financier David M. Rubenstein, and becoming chairman himself.</p>
