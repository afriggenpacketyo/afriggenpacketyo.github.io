          <h2>Study Finds Potentially Hazardous 'Forever Chemicals' in Some Reusable Period Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 10:24:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. study revealed that some reusable period products, such as underwear and menstrual cups, contain high levels of PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals." These substances, linked to cancer and fertility issues, can be absorbed through the skin and contaminate the environment upon disposal. Researchers noted that not all products contained PFAS, suggesting their use is unnecessary for functionality. The study aims to raise consumer awareness to pressure manufacturers into producing safer, chemical-free alternatives, aligning with the eco-friendly branding of these items.</p>

She was impressed by the extensive selection of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal Japanese produce. The store also offered a wide range of ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and numerous green tea options. The author wishes U.S. Costco stores would carry more of these nutrient-dense and culturally significant items.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old dog trainer, initially diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and given less than a year to live, has made a remarkable recovery following a double-lung transplant. Despite having no initial symptoms, a routine scan revealed the progressive and fatal lung disease. After overcoming initial reluctance and enduring a difficult wait, he successfully underwent the procedure at the Cleveland Clinic. Now with 98% lung capacity, he has returned to his life and passion for training hospital therapy dogs, even preparing to train a new puppy named "Encore."</p>

          <p>A deceptive phishing scam is targeting users with emails that imitate official Microsoft security alerts, claiming an issue has been detected with their account. The scam uses links that appear safe, often directing to a Google Docs or SharePoint page, which then redirects to a fake Microsoft login page designed to steal credentials. Experts advise users to be cautious of urgent language, check sender addresses, and hover over links before clicking. To protect against such threats, they recommend using strong antivirus software and never sharing sensitive information or 2FA codes prompted by an unsolicited email.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Washington and Beijing are actively working to arrange a visit to China for U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially in October or November. While a previously rumored September visit for a WWII commemoration is off the table, officials from both nations are said to share a consensus on the trip. The potential visit could occur either before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. This diplomatic effort follows a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, which was described as positive and a crucial step for any leader-level engagement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed the Department of Justice to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This move is seen as an attempt to manage political fallout regarding the president's past association with Epstein. However, legal experts suggest these transcripts may not reveal the most significant details about Epstein's crimes or associates. They argue that more crucial information is likely contained within unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal DOJ memoranda, which would require a broader release of files to provide true transparency.</p>

Critics argue its downtempo, melancholic, yet intricate quality resonates with a collective cultural mood that feels more reserved and hungover than celebratory. This trend towards more subdued music reflects a broader shift, suggesting a culture grappling with widespread malaise.</p>

          <p>The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a major U.S. global health initiative, recently avoided a $400 million funding cut, providing a moment of relief for global health advocates.

Since its creation in 2003, PEPFAR has been credited with saving 26 million lives, but recent disruptions have already impacted services. Experts worry about the program's stability and whether its focus will shift away from prevention and orphan care. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions clinched a thrilling rugby series victory against Australia after Hugo Keenan scored a decisive try in the final minute of the second Test match. In a tense and dramatic game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the Lions overcame a large first-half deficit of 23-5 to fight back. The match was a rollercoaster, with the Wallabies initially dominating before the Lions mounted a remarkable comeback. A late try by Tadhg Beirne narrowed the gap to two points, setting the stage for Keenan's last-gasp score to seal the 29-26 win.</p>

          <p>In a significant political event, Taiwanese voters have rejected an unprecedented attempt to recall 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall campaigns were initiated by supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who were frustrated by the opposition's legislative actions, including blocking budgets and passing controversial reforms. The failure of the recall effort means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face a challenging, divided legislature. The result is seen as a setback for the DPP's hopes of gaining a majority in the legislative body.</p>

Analysts noted that while long-term projects like robotaxis are interesting, the focus is currently on the company's immediate financial performance. This skepticism marks a shift, as investors who previously looked past weak numbers now seem to be demanding more tangible, near-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a significant legal test in a federal appeals court, which could invalidate many of his recent trade actions. The lawsuit challenges his authority to impose duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the basis for his tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, as well as his worldwide "reciprocal" tariffs. A lower court already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision was paused pending this appeal. The outcome of this case, which is likely headed to the Supreme Court, could dismantle the core of Trump's trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, citizens are grappling with increased economic hardship, job losses, and a crackdown on civil liberties. The junta, which cited insecurity and Western influence as reasons for the takeover, has forced many NGOs to cease operations, leading to unemployment. Human rights groups report a severe deterioration in freedom of expression, with arbitrary detentions of opposition figures and journalists. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a swift return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly unlikely.</p>

          <p>A trend of increasing loneliness is being observed in Germany, with young people feeling particularly isolated, a phenomenon exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and social media. Sociologists warn that this isolation can have serious consequences, as studies show a correlation between loneliness and a higher susceptibility to authoritarian thinking and conspiracy theories. The problem is not confined to youth, as surveys indicate a majority of Germans experience loneliness, and it is influenced by factors like unemployment and poverty. Researchers suggest this social fragmentation could pose a potential threat to democratic cohesion.</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter and longer summers, more Americans are forced to stay indoors to escape extreme heat, potentially contributing to a form of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) typically associated with winter. This "summer SAD" involves symptoms like low energy and sadness, which may stem from a lack of sun exposure, disrupted sleep, and social isolation caused by avoiding the heat. While summer SAD is rarer and less studied than its winter counterpart, therapists are seeing more clients who feel depressed during the hot months.
