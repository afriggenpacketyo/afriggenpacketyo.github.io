            <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered his first public remarks since leaving office, emphasizing the importance of preserving Social Security and urging national unity. Speaking at a convention in Chicago, Biden criticized the Trump administration's policies without directly naming Trump. He defended his administration's efforts to combat Social Security fraud and challenged claims that many elderly individuals are fraudulently collecting payments. Biden also criticized Republican members of Congress for seeking to cut Social Security, highlighting the Democratic party's focus on this issue after recent election losses.</p>

            <p>A senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Dan Caldwell, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into an unauthorized disclosure, according to a defense official. The investigation was prompted by a memo from Hegseth's chief of staff directing the Pentagon to investigate unauthorized disclosures and potentially use lie detector tests. Caldwell is accused of sharing classified documents with reporters and was previously associated with foreign policy think tanks. The investigation also follows reports denying Elon Musk's involvement in Pentagon briefings, despite his heavy involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has suggested sending American citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons, specifically mentioning El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison during a meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Legal experts argue that such a move would be unconstitutional, citing multiple constitutional provisions that protect citizens from being deported. Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt have been vague about the legal basis for this proposal, stating that it is under review. The suggestion has raised concerns about potential violations of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, particularly for Medicare recipients. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) to standardize Medicare payments for prescription drugs, potentially lowering prices by up to 60%. It also seeks to match Medicare payments to hospital drug prices and lower insulin costs for low-income and uninsured patients. The order also aims to facilitate state importation programs and improve transparency in Medicare drug price negotiations, but the impact of the new tariffs on Chinese imports could potentially increase prices for medical treatments and drugs.</p>

The judge emphasized the irreparable harm caused by his continued detention in El Salvador's CECOT prison.

The article contrasts Perry's approach to fame with that of other celebrities, noting her willingness to embrace silliness and her genuine enthusiasm. It argues that Perry's space flight, while perhaps absurd, is consistent with her persona as an unpretentious and sincere performer.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's tariff policies are creating significant disruptions for US ports and trade-dependent businesses. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle a substantial portion of containerized cargo entering the US, are experiencing disarray. Supply-chain analysts warn of increased uncertainty, rerouting, uneven port utilization, and potential job losses. While Los Angeles has seen a surge in activity as importers stockpile goods, the long-term effects of the tariffs remain a concern for the stability of trade networks.</p>

The executive order also aims to align Medicare payments for drugs with hospital costs and standardize patient payment rates.

Some worry that the escalating tariffs are reminiscent of the pre-World War II era and could lead to military conflict. While China will not yield on issues of core interest, Beijing does not seek confrontation but prepares for it.</p>

The Saints have used the fleur-de-lis since 1967 and registered the trademark in 1974.

            <p>President Trump has signed an executive action with the goal of lowering prescription drug prices for Americans, with a focus on Medicare recipients. The move aims to improve the Medicare drug price negotiation program and resurrect a program to provide low-income individuals with affordable insulin. The action also directs the FDA to facilitate state importation programs and streamline approval for lower-cost generics and biosimilars. However, potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could offset some of these savings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's economic growth could be significantly impacted by soaring US import tariffs, but its growing trade and investment ties with Southeast Asia may help mitigate the losses. Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) economists predict that US tariffs could limit China's GDP growth this year. While the US market has been a major export destination for China, the country's deepening economic relationships with Southeast Asian nations could provide an alternative source of demand and investment.</p>

            <p>With the April 15 tax deadline approaching, many taxpayers may consider filing for an extension to gain additional time. An extension provides an extra six months to file federal income tax returns without penalty, but it does not extend the deadline to pay any taxes owed. The IRS offers various methods for filing an extension, including online payment systems and Form 4868. Failure to file or pay taxes on time can result in penalties, although the IRS may grant relief in cases of reasonable cause.</p>
