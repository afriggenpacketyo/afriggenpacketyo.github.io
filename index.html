          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early, citing more pressing matters than the Israel-Iran conflict, urging Iranians to evacuate Tehran. G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel while calling for de-escalation in the Middle East and condemning Iran's destabilizing actions. Trump criticized French President Macron's ceasefire comments and reiterated his stance that Iran should have agreed to his proposed deal. The G7 also addressed global trade issues and support for Ukraine, with Trump indicating reluctance to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, reflecting divisions among allied leaders. The situation is tense and is currently being addressed. The optimism score is 20.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed upon last month. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and does not address the removal of charges on steel imports. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year, with a similar system planned for steel and aluminum. UK officials expressed optimism about the deal's potential to shield British businesses from Trump's tariffs and are working towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>President Trump cut his G7 trip short due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, returning to Washington on Monday night. This decision followed heightened conflict between Israel and Iran, marked by airstrikes and missile attacks, leading Trump to call for the evacuation of Tehran. Despite reports of Iran seeking de-escalation, Trump emphasized the need for Iran to have agreed to a deal earlier. While the US maintains it is not directly involved in Israel's strikes, it has provided assistance in intercepting Iranian missiles. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>A Russian missile and drone barrage in Kyiv resulted in at least 14 deaths, including an American citizen, and 44 injuries, marking one of the deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in recent months.

An attorney suggested the jury should have been sequestered to avoid such issues, as jurors are instructed not to discuss the case outside the jury.

          <p>Gold has emerged as the ultimate safe haven asset, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025, outpacing traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys. Experts attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, providing investors with a hedge against fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical instability. Demand for gold has been fueled by uncertainty, especially in the Middle East, and waning confidence in U.S. assets. Unlike other safe havens, gold is not affected by high debt-to-GDP ratios and remains apolitical. The optimism score is 75. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that directives from the Trump administration that led to the cancellation of several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were "void" and "illegal". The judge stated that the cancellation of grants related to LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) violated federal law. The NIH has been ordered to restore the terminated grants, with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) exploring legal options. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency warns that England faces significant water shortages and needs a "continued and sustained effort" to reduce demand, including more hosepipe bans and smart water meters. Without dramatic action, England, which uses 14 billion litres of water a day, will have a daily shortage of more than six billion litres by 2055. The agency says more homes will need meters reporting how much water is used in real time and that prices may need to rise when supplies are tight.
