        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's request to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that individual district judges issuing nationwide orders creates an unfair legal playing field. Justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, and Barrett raised concerns about the legality and impact of limiting nationwide injunctions, while Kagan questioned whether abolishing them would inject more chaos into the court system. The court's decision will determine the extent of presidential power and the role of judicial review in shaping immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Harvard University discovered that a copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, purchased for $27.50, is a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, potentially worth millions. Researchers David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent confirmed its authenticity by comparing it to other known copies. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to England.

          <p>In Georgia, a brain-dead pregnant woman is being kept on life support to comply with the state's abortion law, which bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Doctors are maintaining her life support to allow the fetus time to develop, though the fetus has fluid on the brain and faces potential health issues. The case highlights the consequences of abortion bans since the overturning of Roe v Wade. The family's ability to make medical decisions for their daughter has been superseded by state law.</p>

The legislation, aimed at extending major tax cuts, also contains provisions for multinational corporations, gym memberships, and banks.

The specialized breaks contrast with the goal of simplifying the tax code, and some lawmakers threaten to sink the plan if they donâ€™t get a more generous state and local tax deduction.</p>
