          <p>As Israel prepares to deploy tens of thousands of reserve soldiers to Gaza, questions arise about the effectiveness of increased military force in achieving its goals against Hamas, especially after 18 months of conflict. Despite the extensive military operations, Hamas remains a threat, and the release of hostages is still uncertain. Experts like Tamir Hayman suggest that military pressure alone may not suffice and advocate for ending the war with a weakened Hamas that can be contained. The expansion of the offensive also raises concerns among hostage families, who fear the increased risk to their loved ones' safety. The article highlights the debate within Israel regarding the strategy and goals of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>An essay in The New York Times argues that Donald Trump's second term has exposed the full extent of presidential power, building on excesses of recent presidencies. The author contends that the pattern of presidential action over the past few decades reveals an escalation of power grabs, necessitating reforms to limit the presidency. Examples include the use of emergency powers, pardons, and executive orders, tracing back to actions by presidents such as Nixon, Bush, Obama, and Biden. The essay calls for constitutional amendments and a return to congressional primacy to curb the expanding power of the executive branch.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the benefit clawback rate from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries facing overpayment notices issued on or after April 25, 2025. This change applies to Title II benefits, including retirement, survivors, and disability insurance, while the rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains at 10%. Experts warn that even a 50% reduction in benefits could cause significant financial hardship for affected individuals, potentially leading to homelessness. The previous plan to withhold 100% of overpayments was criticized as draconian and cruel, prompting the agency to reconsider its approach.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that pro-family policies should embrace diverse family structures beyond the traditional model of married men and women. With American households changing significantly, policies should support single parents, unmarried couples, and those raising children with friends. The author contends that focusing solely on marriage as the ideal family structure is a moral and strategic mistake, and policies should instead lower barriers for all individuals hoping to start or support families. This includes subsidizing assisted reproductive technologies and extending family-leave policies to anyone responsible for taking care of a family member.</p>
