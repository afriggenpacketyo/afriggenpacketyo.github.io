          <h2>Chicago Communities Divided Over Potential National Guard Deployment by Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the mixed reactions within Chicago to President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to combat crime. While some residents in high-crime areas welcome the idea, others, including community leaders and officials, argue it is an unnecessary militarization, pointing to a recent significant drop in the city's violent crime rates. The report highlights that local authorities and non-profits believe they are already making progress and that federal troops lack the proper authority for domestic policing. This potential deployment also fuels anxiety in Latino communities over immigration raids, adding another layer of tension to the situation.</p>

          <p>More than 25 million people across the U.S. Northeast, from Maryland to Maine, are under a severe weather alert for Saturday. A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect, with major cities like Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston in the path of the storm system. The primary threats include damaging wind gusts, large hail, and the potential for isolated, brief tornadoes, particularly in northern New England. Forecasters also warn of localized flash flooding due to slow-moving, torrential downpours, especially in urban and poor-drainage areas, with the storms expected to continue into the overnight hours before cooler, fall-like air moves in.</p>

          <p>The Florida State football team paid tribute to freshman linebacker Ethan Pritchard during their game against East Texas A&M. Pritchard is currently hospitalized after sustaining a gunshot wound to the back of the head while driving last weekend. To honor their teammate, players wore No. 35 wristbands, and his jersey was carried to midfield for the coin toss by safety Earl Little Jr. Pritchard's father was in attendance for the game, where the team showed strong support for the recovering four-star recruit who had been a standout player at Seminole High School before joining the university.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their place in the Rugby World Cup last eight with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 matches. Despite the dominant final score, England delivered an untidy first-half performance, struggling with their line-outs and allowing Australia to take an early lead. Coach John Mitchell acknowledged the team's defensive strength in the second half but noted their attack was messy. While England ultimately overpowered the Wallaroos, their initial difficulties against a lower-ranked team may offer encouragement to stronger rivals like Canada, New Zealand, and France as the tournament enters the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>Jamie Borthwick, who has played the character Jay Brown on the BBC soap opera 'EastEnders' since 2006, has been let go from the show after nearly two decades. The decision comes after Borthwick was suspended by the BBC earlier this year for using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of 'Strictly Come Dancing.'

          <p>Broadcasters covering the US Open men's final have been asked by organizers to avoid showing any negative crowd reactions, such as booing, directed at former President Donald Trump, who is expected to attend. An email to media partners specified that while Trump will be shown on screen during the national anthem, they should refrain from broadcasting any disruptions related to his presence. Trump has not attended the tournament since 2015, when he was booed by spectators. Despite the potential for distraction, finalist Carlos Alcaraz stated that having a president attend is a privilege for tennis and that he will try not to be nervous.</p>

The brakeman attempted to apply emergency brakes but was unable to prevent the upper carriage from derailing and crashing into a building at approximately 60 km/h. The report noted that the cable was only about halfway through its expected operational lifespan, and further investigation is needed to determine why it failed and if an automatic brake functioned correctly.</p>

Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020, with Verstappen's lap averaging 164.466 mph. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars having less drag, a recently resurfaced track with better grip, and Monza's long straights. Verstappen noted that while the 2020 Mercedes might still be faster overall, the specific conditions at Monza allowed for this historic achievement, which is unlikely to be broken soon due to upcoming rule changes.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has fallen by over 80% since the Trump administration eliminated a tariff exemption for low-value imported parcels, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The rule change, which took effect in August 2025, removed the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued at $800 or less, placing the burden of customs duty collection on carriers. This has caused major operational disruptions, as many foreign postal operators and airlines were not equipped to handle the new requirements, leading 88 operators to suspend some or all services to the U.S. and causing a near-halt in incoming international mail.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has enacted an executive order aimed at punishing foreign governments that wrongfully detain American citizens abroad. The order grants the State Department new authority to impose sanctions and other penalties by creating a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, similar to the existing terrorism sponsor list. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will face consequences, including economic sanctions and visa restrictions. The move is intended to increase pressure on countries to release the dozens of U.S. nationals that advocacy groups say are being unjustly held.</p>

          <p>This short article from The Economist positions Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker as a prominent and combative figure within the Democratic Party, particularly in his opposition to Donald Trump. As a wealthy politician himself, Pritzker has used his resources and platform to challenge Trump directly, notably during the Democratic National Convention which he helped bring to Chicago. The piece notes the irony that Trump's recent financial gains have now made him wealthier than Pritzker. It frames Pritzker as someone eager to lead the Democratic charge into political battle against the current administration, representing a key voice of the opposition.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a significant reshuffle of his government, with major changes at the Home Office following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office. Ministers Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have been moved to other departments, while Sarah Jones, Alex Norris, and Mike Tapp have been appointed as new Home Office ministers under new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. The appointments, particularly of Tapp, who is a vocal critic of Reform UK on immigration, signal the Prime Minister's focus on tackling illegal immigration. Other key changes include Anna Turley becoming Labour Party Chair and attending cabinet.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a volatile session after the August jobs report showed significantly slower growth than anticipated, with only 22,000 nonfarm payrolls added. Initially, this weak data boosted investor hopes for an imminent interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, causing Treasury yields to drop. However, the optimism was soon tempered by overriding concerns that the sluggish labor market could signal a broader economic slowdown, leading to a market reversal. The article notes that despite the daily fluctuations, major indices still managed to close the week with modest gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Musician Kid Rock is facing public criticism after his private jet, featuring what some have described as tacky artwork, was spotted at a Michigan airport. The sighting on social media sparked a backlash focusing on both the jet's appearance and the significant environmental damage caused by private air travel. Private jets are noted as being an extremely wasteful mode of transport, producing excessive pollution, with many flights being short-haul trips or empty return legs. Commenters on Reddit criticized the display of wealth as out of touch and a symbol of growing inequality, with some calling for such travel to be outlawed.</p>

This has led to speculation about his reasons, with some suggesting a move to the Washington, D.C. campus, which focuses on government-related coursework and internships, would align with his past involvement in his father's campaign.

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle ranches. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a massive, five-year restoration effort aimed at reviving native ecosystems. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plants and promote the regrowth of native species. While the transition is painful for the multigenerational ranching community, conservationists are hopeful the project will create a resilient landscape and serve as a model for ecological restoration.</p>
