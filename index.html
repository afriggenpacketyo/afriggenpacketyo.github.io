          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has asserted that Russia will pursue its objectives militarily if a diplomatic agreement with Ukraine is not reached. Speaking in China, he maintained a stance open to negotiation but reiterated firm demands, including the retention of seized territories in the Donbas region and a commitment from Ukraine to not join NATO. Despite ongoing diplomatic engagement from the U.S., Putin's conditions create a tense standoff, balancing the possibility of a peace deal against the explicit threat of continued warfare to achieve Russia's strategic aims.</p>

          <p>Macy's stock surged by 20% after the retailer announced second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street's forecasts and subsequently raised its full-year financial outlook. The company credited this strong performance to successful strategies in its revamped stores and robust sales in key apparel categories. CEO Tony Spring expressed cautious optimism, noting that while tariff impacts are a consideration, the company is well-positioned to navigate the economic environment and benefit from resilient consumer spending habits.

          <p>Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates a significant cooling in the U.S. labor market, with job openings falling to 7.18 million in July.

An ounce of gold bought from Costco a year ago for around $2,679 has seen a substantial unrealized gain, reflecting a broader trend of investors turning to gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation. However, selling the gold for a profit involves complexities, as sellers must account for dealer fees and taxes on collectibles, which can reduce the final return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are under NBA investigation following accusations that the team paid star player Kawhi Leonard $28 million through a third-party company to circumvent the league's salary cap. A report alleges the payment was made via a now-bankrupt firm, Aspiration, with a clause ensuring Leonard would be paid only if he remained a Clippers player. The team and its owner, Steve Ballmer, have denied any misconduct, but the league has confirmed it is commencing an investigation into the serious allegations.</p>

The herbivore, about the size of a small car, was covered in a diverse array of plates and spikes, including three-foot-long spikes on its neck and ribs fused with projecting barbs—a feature never seen before in any vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting that these dinosaurs developed highly elaborate and potentially ornamental armor much earlier than previously believed.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated promises to end the war in Ukraine quickly, the conflict persists with no clear resolution in sight, largely due to fundamental disagreements on core issues. While direct talks have resumed, Russia's demands—including territorial concessions and restrictions on Ukraine's sovereignty—remain largely unacceptable to Kyiv, even as Ukraine's own position has softened due to battlefield realities. Experts suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin perceives the conflict as an existential struggle with the West, making him unlikely to compromise on key demands, thereby prolonging the war.</p>

A company executive highlighted the pill's strong efficacy and safety profile, expressing confidence in Novo Nordisk's ability to meet high demand and avoid the supply shortages that have plagued injectable treatments.</p>

This incident follows earlier disruptions in the race, including protesters holding up the Israel-Premier Tech team, leading to increased calls from riders and the professional cyclists' association for better security to ensure their safety during the event.</p>

His remains were recovered in 1957 but could not be identified until recent advancements in DNA analysis, including mitochondrial and Y-chromosome testing, finally confirmed his identity, allowing for his burial in his hometown.</p>
