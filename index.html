          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering selling his Tesla vehicle following a public falling out with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Trump purchased the electric vehicle in March to demonstrate his support for Tesla and Musk, who faced criticism for his involvement in the Trump administration's efforts to reduce government spending. This decision comes after a series of attacks on Tesla vehicles and locations connected to the company. The feud between Trump and Musk has escalated recently, leading to Trump's contemplation of parting ways with his Tesla.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army's Caisson Detachment has resumed its ceremonial duties at Arlington National Cemetery after a two-year suspension and a $28 million overhaul. The program was halted in May 2023 due to concerns about the living conditions and care of the horses. An investigation revealed inadequate stables, poor quality feed, and untreated illnesses, leading to the deaths of several horses. The Army has since renovated the stables, improved horse care practices, and brought in equine experts to ensure the well-being of the animals and the continuation of this historic tradition.</p>

          <p>An international drug trafficking ring has been dismantled by police forces from several countries, with authorities reporting that the group used high-speed "narco boats" to smuggle cocaine from South America to Spain's Canary Islands. The ring allegedly utilized an abandoned shipwreck as a refueling platform for the speedboats. Authorities have seized nearly 3,800 kilos of cocaine, 19 boats, and approximately 100,000 euros as part of the operation. Forty-eight people have been arrested in connection with the smuggling ring.</p>

          <p>The feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has revealed a rift within the contemporary right, encompassing both personal and ideological differences. Musk's opposition to Trump's "big, beautiful bill" stems from the legislation's elimination of a tax credit for electric vehicles and concerns over the growing national debt. This conflict highlights the tension between traditional conservatives focused on fiscal responsibility and nationalist conservatives who favor state power and intervention. The dispute could impact Trump's ability to pass his legislative agenda, as Musk has the resources and platform to challenge the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Tesla stock experienced a 5% increase Friday as it sought to recover from a market rout triggered by the conflict between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. The previous day's turmoil had erased $152 billion from the company's market capitalization. Analysts suggest that the underlying strength of Tesla's investor base remains resilient, with some anticipating a potential truce between Musk and Trump. Musk had publicly criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures.</p>
