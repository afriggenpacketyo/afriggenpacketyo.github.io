          <p>Jeremy Crawshaw, a 23-year-old punter from Emu Plains, Australia, was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the sixth round of the NFL draft, making him the first punter selected. Crawshaw, who played for the University of Florida, averaged 45.8 yards per punt in 2024 and set a single-season record for punt average in 2023. He will compete with veteran P Matt Haack for the starting job and joins other Australian punters in the NFL, bringing a unique perspective to directional punting and spin control, making him a valuable asset for the Broncos. The Broncos' special teams coordinator, Darren Rizzi, sought out Crawshaw at Florida's Pro Day, leading to the deal.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refuted claims by the Venezuelan government that the Trump administration was separating children from parents who are members of the Tren de Aragua gang (TdA). DHS stated that it took action because the child's parents are part of TdA, with the father overseeing homicides, drug sales, kidnappings, extortion, sexual assault trafficking, and operating a torture house, and the mother recruiting young women for drug smuggling and prostitution. The child was removed from the deportation flight manifest for safety and placed with a foster family through the Office of Refugee Resettlement, with DHS emphasizing its commitment to protecting children from abuse and exploitation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has called for American commercial and military ships to have free transit through the Panama and Suez Canals, directing his secretary of state to ensure this happens. Trump claimed the US was essential to the creation of both canals and that these routes should be free for American vessels. The Panamanian president responded by stating that canal toll fees are regulated by an autonomous body, and Egypt reported a significant revenue drop in 2024 due to Houthi attacks affecting Suez Canal traffic, leading to ongoing US military action against Houthi positions.</p>

          <p>Canada's election campaign has seen a dramatic shift, with the Liberals, led by Mark Carney, gaining ground against the Conservatives amidst concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Carney is positioning himself as a steady leader ready to address the challenges posed by Trump's tariffs and suggestions of annexation. The election has become a referendum on how to handle the US president, with Trump's threats motivating left-leaning voters to support Carney's Liberals, who were previously trailing significantly in the polls.
