          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the performance has drawn criticism for lacking inspiration and momentum under new coach Thomas Tuchel. The victory, secured by an own goal and a header from Declan Rice, solidifies England's top position in their group, yet the team has been described as having regressed since the last European Championship. Despite maintaining a clean sheet in qualifiers, the lackluster display against the 174th-ranked team raised concerns about the team's creative abilities and end product, with many fans leaving the stadium early.</p>

          <p>South Sudan's government has repatriated a Mexican citizen, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, who was deported from the United States to the East African nation in July. Munoz-Gutierrez was part of a group of eight men with serious criminal convictions in the U.S. who were sent to third-party countries, none of whom were South Sudanese nationals. This action is part of a controversial Trump administration policy that has faced legal challenges and criticism from rights groups for violating international law. The repatriation was coordinated with the Mexican Embassy in Ethiopia.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon has determined that a snapped cable was the cause of the tragic incident. The derailment of one of the iconic 140-year-old carriages resulted in the deaths of sixteen people, including multiple foreign nationals, and injured about twenty others. Portuguese officials have confirmed that the rest of the railway's mechanism appeared to be functioning correctly prior to the cable failure. The prime minister described the event as one of the nation's biggest recent tragedies.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two naturalized U.S. citizens, Benedict Nwana Kuah and Pascal Kikishy Wongbi, for allegedly using their Minnesota residences to lead a separatist militia in Cameroon. The indictment accuses them of financing and directing kidnappings, bombings, and killings to intimidate civilians and coerce the Cameroonian government. The men are charged with raising funds for weapons and explosives, leading to attacks that caused numerous casualties, including the death of a 15-year-old girl. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of life in prison.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 475 workers, mostly South Korean nationals, at a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant under construction in Georgia. The raid, described as the largest single-site operation in Homeland Security Investigations history, has created diplomatic tension, prompting South Korea's foreign minister to consider a U.S. visit. While U.S. officials state the operation targets illegal employment and protects American jobs, it raises questions about corporate oversight and the administration's immigration policies. Hyundai and its partner LG Energy Solution are investigating their employment practices in response.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American pilot and social media influencer, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean air base in Antarctica. He was held after landing his small plane without proper authorization while attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents for charity. Guo was released after agreeing to pay $30,000 in penalties and is banned from Chile for three years. He described his detention as a "mundane" experience and praised the Chilean people for their hospitality during his confinement.</p>

Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020, with Verstappen reaching an average speed of 164.466mph. This new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars having less drag, a recently resurfaced track with better grip, and favorable cornering conditions. Verstappen expressed optimism about his chances in the upcoming race despite strong competition from McLaren.</p>

The system has been used regionally for events such as storm warnings and the evacuation for an unexploded World War II bomb.

In response, OpenAI expressed condolences and announced new safety measures, including enhanced collaboration with medical experts and more age-appropriate controls for teen users.

Initially, markets rallied on the belief that the slowdown, with only 22,000 nonfarm payrolls added, would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. However, this optimism was soon replaced by concerns that the labor market's weakness could signal a broader economic downturn, causing the market to reverse its gains.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he knows "anything" about a reported secret 2019 mission in North Korea involving SEAL Team 6. A New York Times article, citing numerous anonymous sources, alleged that Trump had approved an operation to plant a surveillance device to intercept communications from Kim Jong-un. The mission was reportedly aborted after the SEALs feared they were discovered and opened fire on a North Korean boat, killing unarmed civilians who were believed to be diving for shellfish. According to the report, the incident was never disclosed to Congress.</p>

          <p>A photograph of musician Kid Rock's private jet has sparked backlash on social media, with users criticizing its "tacky" artwork and the environmental consequences of private air travel. The Bombardier Challenger 601-3R jet, spotted at a Michigan airport, has been used for approximately 170 flights in 2024 alone. The incident has renewed debate over the use of private jets by the wealthy, which are a significant source of carbon pollution and often used for short trips that could be made via more sustainable transport. Critics described the display as an example of how "money cannot buy class."</p>

          <p>Approximately 300 people were arrested at a demonstration in London's Parliament Square protesting the UK government's decision to proscribe the campaign group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. The ban makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. During the rally, hundreds of protesters held signs supporting the group, leading to arrests for offenses including expressing support for a proscribed organization. The Metropolitan Police reported that officers faced significant abuse, while organizers accused the police of using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has stopped providing protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a decision that comes after internal criticism that the assignment was diverting officers from crime suppression duties. LAPD officers had been assisting the California Highway Patrol with her security after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection. The police union had criticized the move, arguing that a multimillionaire should pay for her own security rather than use taxpayer-funded officers. The mayor's office stated that the LAPD's support was always intended to be temporary.</p>

In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the "imperialist policies" of the U.S. and announced a plan to activate millions of armed militiamen.

          <p>A new chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a multimillion-dollar buyout deal was reached for 12 organic dairy and cattle ranches to cease operations on the land. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a large-scale, five-year ecological restoration project. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plants and help native grasslands recover. While celebrated by conservationists, it has been a painful transition for the multigenerational ranching families and raises concerns about the regional supply of organic dairy.</p>

          <p>A dermatologist is urging people to treat daily sunscreen application with the same importance as brushing their teeth to protect their skin, the body's largest organ. Key advice includes remembering to apply sunscreen to often-missed areas like eyelids, ears, and lips, which are highly susceptible to UV damage. While SPF 30 is the minimum recommendation, higher SPFs are more effective because most people do not apply a sufficient amount. Sun protection is a year-round necessity, not just for summer, as cumulative damage can lead to conditions like dermatoporosis in later life.</p>
