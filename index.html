        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States defense sector heavily relies on China for critical minerals essential to advanced weapon systems, creating a vulnerability as Beijing tightens export restrictions. China dominates the global supply of rare earth elements and other critical minerals, giving them leverage in trade negotiations and potentially affecting the Pentagon's military readiness. Recent export controls imposed by China on gallium, germanium, antimony, and rare earth elements have raised concerns about the security of the US defense supply chain. This dependence highlights the need for diversification and alternative sourcing to mitigate risks to national security.</p>

          <p>A suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is in custody after allegedly attacking a group of people with a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were participating in a walk to remember Israeli hostages, and Soliman was reportedly heard yelling "free Palestine" during the attack. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of violence and terrorism, and officials have confirmed that Soliman is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in 2023. One of the victims is an 88-year-old Holocaust refugee, and the attack has been condemned by officials as a hate crime.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's promise to achieve peace in Ukraine within a day, progress has been slow, with Russia and Ukraine holding firm on territorial disputes. Russia proposed peace negotiations in Istanbul, but both sides remain entrenched in their positions, making substantial progress unlikely. Trump has expressed frustration and suggested potentially withdrawing from the process if the leaders cannot make progress soon. While some experts caution against the US stepping back, others suggest reduced presidential involvement could be beneficial, but cutting off aid to Kyiv would be detrimental.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize flight paths through the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS), potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. Many of the current routes were established approximately 70 years ago and are in need of an overhaul to meet modern demands. The initial focus of the redesign will be on the complex airspace in and around London. However, concerns have been raised by community groups that the changes could introduce new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist supported by Donald Trump, has won the Polish presidency in a close race, posing challenges for the current pro-EU government.

The election's outcome raises concerns about Poland's alignment with Brussels and Kyiv, as Nawrocki holds a more critical view of Ukraine and may hinder the pro-EU agenda of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

          <p>Children attending Lybrook Elementary School in New Mexico are experiencing headaches, nausea, and vomiting due to pollution from nearby natural gas operations. The school sits in the San Juan Basin, surrounded by numerous oil and gas wells, leading to concerns about the health and academic performance of students. Studies have found elevated levels of pollutants, including benzene and hydrogen sulfide, near the school, correlating with health issues and poor academic proficiency. While the oil and gas industry provides economic benefits and supports education funding, the proximity of wells to schools raises questions about the trade-offs between economic gains and children's well-being.</p>

          <p>A fierce battle over artificial intelligence (AI) and copyright is ongoing, pitting the government against the creative industry. The argument centers on balancing the needs of the tech and creative sectors, specifically how to grant AI developers access to copyrighted content for better AI tools without harming content creators' livelihoods. The Data (Use and Access) Bill, which allows AI developers access to all content unless owners opt out, faces opposition from peers who want AI firms to disclose used copyrighted material for licensing.
