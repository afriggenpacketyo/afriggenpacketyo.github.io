          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have concluded that a so-called "client list" implicating high-profile associates of Jeffrey Epstein does not exist, contradicting widespread conspiracy theories. A memo from the agencies also reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein died by suicide, stating there is "no credible evidence" of murder or that he blackmailed prominent individuals. This conclusion has been met with disbelief and accusations of a cover-up from some of President Trump's supporters, who have been anticipating new revelations promised during the campaign. The White House clarified that some related files were withheld due to their graphic nature.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company has named Kirk Tanner, the current CEO of Wendy's, as its next chief executive, effective August 18. Tanner will succeed Michele Buck, who is retiring after nearly two decades with the confectionery giant. This move marks a return to the consumer packaged goods industry for Tanner, who spent over 30 years at PepsiCo before his brief tenure at Wendy's. In the interim, Wendy's has appointed its Chief Financial Officer, Ken Cook, as temporary CEO while the board searches for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with its plans for extensive layoffs and reorganization across numerous federal agencies. This decision allows the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its cost-cutting initiatives while legal challenges continue in lower courts. The court's majority argued the administration is likely to succeed on the merits of the case, though it did not rule on the legality of specific agency plans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the court for enabling what she termed legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is scheduled for a Senate confirmation hearing next week. Waltz, who previously served as Trump's national security adviser, is expected to face intense questioning from Democratic senators on the Foreign Relations Committee. The scrutiny will likely focus on his involvement in a security breach where sensitive military plans were discussed in a Signal chat that mistakenly included a journalist. The hearing also follows the recent U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, adding another layer of complexity to his confirmation process.</p>

          <p>Georgia Representative Mike Collins is reportedly considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 2026, aiming to challenge incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. In a video, Collins stated that while a Senate bid was not his original plan, he believes Ossoff "must go" and does not represent Georgia's values. The two-term congressman, a staunch Trump ally, indicated he would consult with his family and the former president before making a final decision. The Georgia Senate seat is seen by Republicans as a key opportunity to expand their majority in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

The announcement, made during a cabinet meeting, also hinted at future steep tariffs on other sectors, including pharmaceuticals. Following the news, copper prices surged to a record high, and shares of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan increased. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the move aligns copper tariffs with existing duties on steel and aluminum and is expected to be formalized by the end of July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension triple lock will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times higher than originally estimated. The triple lock policy ensures the state pension rises each year by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report warns that rising pension and healthcare spending puts the UK's public finances in an "unsustainable position" in the long term.

          <p>The recent passage of major cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid has reignited the progressive debate over whether to pursue universal or targeted social benefits. This article argues against the conclusion that this event proves universal programs like Social Security are inherently more politically durable. It points out that the history of U.S. social policy shows that means-tested programs have grown substantially over the last 50 years, while some universal programs have faced cuts. The author contends that the strongest arguments for universal benefits are based on their policy effectiveness, not on a flawed assumption of political invulnerability.</p>

          <p>Consumers and restaurants in the U.S. are facing record-high beef prices, which reached $5.98 per pound in May, the highest since tracking began in the 1980s. The price surge is primarily driven by a classic supply and demand imbalance, with robust consumer demand for beef coinciding with the smallest national cattle herd since the 1960s. Widespread drought conditions in recent years have forced ranchers to reduce their herds, and rebuilding them is a slow process.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that he cannot halt the Trump administration's decision to rescind millions of dollars in grants from non-profit organizations focused on preventing gun violence, substance abuse, and hate crimes. While Judge Amit P. Mehta described the Department of Justice's funding cuts as "shameful" and likely to harm vulnerable communities, he concluded he lacked the legal authority to issue an injunction. The lawsuit was filed by five organizations after the Justice Department terminated their grants, stating the funds would be redirected to support law enforcement operations and other priorities.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is being lauded for its departure from the grim tone of recent adaptations, instead offering a bright, sincere, and whimsical take on the hero. The film introduces Superman into a world already populated with other superheroes, a choice that helps define his unique, earnest altruism. David Corenswet's portrayal emphasizes a more relatable, "regular-guy" sensibility for the character. This article praises the movie for embracing a fun, cartoonish energy and for building modern skepticism about sincerity directly into its optimistic and consciously silly narrative.</p>

          <p>The UK's Parliament has voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five tiers of men's football in England. The new body, independent of government and existing football authorities, is designed to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and putting fans' interests first. The legislation was introduced to address financial crises that have affected numerous clubs like Bury and Derby County. A proposal to mandate that more Premier League games be shown on free-to-air television was voted down during the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $20,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing interest rates against accessibility. While both currently offer high returns, short-term CDs often provide slightly higher fixed rates, potentially earning more interest than a high-yield savings account over periods of three to twelve months. However, for longer terms, the higher variable rate of a savings account might yield more, assuming rates remain stable. The article emphasizes that CDs lock up funds, whereas savings accounts keep money liquid, making the best choice dependent on an individual's financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The article argues this "war" has become a contest of cosmologies, moving beyond evidence to faith.

According to people familiar with the matter, the agency briefed industry members on the upcoming change this week. The requirement for passengers to remove their shoes was implemented in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001.

          <p>No-closing-cost home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are attracting homeowners, but it's crucial to understand the trade-offs before borrowing. Lenders often recoup the waived closing fees by charging a higher interest rate or by imposing penalties if the credit line is closed within a few years. Borrowers should calculate the break-even point to see if paying closing costs upfront would be cheaper in the long run. These products also tend to have stricter credit requirements. Homeowners are advised to read the fine print carefully and compare these HELOCs with traditional options to determine the most suitable financial strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
