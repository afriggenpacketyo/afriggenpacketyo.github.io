        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's social media announcement about renaming Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House clarified that it would be an additional proclamation, not a replacement. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that they are not renaming Veteran's Day and it will simply be an additional proclamation. Trump also intended to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing a federal holiday or observance requires congressional approval. This article clarifies the Trump administration's stance and the process for creating federal holidays.</p>

          <p>A federal judge permanently struck down Donald Trump’s executive order that targeted the firm Perkins Coie, which once worked with his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton, after declaring in an extraordinary ruling that the order was unconstitutional and unlawful. The judge criticized the order for violating the first, fifth, and sixth amendments. The executive order had barred federal employees from engaging with Perkins Coie attorneys and restricted their access to federal buildings. The judge deemed the order retaliatory and a violation of viewpoint discrimination. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the rising number of autism diagnoses, attributing it to changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, rather than a true increase in the prevalence of autism. The definition of autism has broadened over time, encompassing conditions like Asperger's syndrome and "pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified" (PDD-NOS). Furthermore, there's a growing recognition of autism in women and adults, who were previously often misdiagnosed or overlooked. While some worry about the potential glamorization of autism, others emphasize the importance of diagnosis for providing support and improving mental health. The article presents different perspectives on the implications of the rising diagnosis rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced a significant reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), signaling major staff cuts, particularly in scientific research. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin aims to reduce staffing to levels similar to the 1980s, potentially impacting thousands of employees. Changes are planned for the Office of Research and Development (ORD), with some staff moving to policy-making offices. Former EPA officials express concern that these changes could undermine research and the agency's ability to protect human health. Zeldin claims the reorganization will save $300 million by 2026, while critics fear cuts to crucial research programs.</p>

          <p>The trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree in northern England has revealed key evidence, including a video of the felling found on one defendant's phone. Prosecutors allege that Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers carried out the act, with one filming the other. Cell site analysis and camera footage track the movements of Graham's phone and car to the site. Graham testified that Carruthers felled the tree without his knowledge, while Carruthers denies any involvement.

Reports also emerged of a planned military parade to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army and Trump's birthday. The administration is planning a 13% rise – to more than $1tn – in the Pentagon budget, a commitment at odds with Donald Trump’s frequent vows to end the US’s involvement in “forever wars” in the Middle East and elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Prior to the Pacific Palisades fire, Los Angeles water managers had considered reviving an old reservoir to boost water capacity, but the plan was never completed. The neighborhood's main reservoir was offline for repairs, and firefighters ran short of water during the blaze. Emails show the city searched for solutions but failed to address the supply shortage in time. City officials say bringing the old reservoir back online posed safety risks. The inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the potential water supply in the area.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Office has defended its decision to classify the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, after criticism from US officials. The AfD came second in federal elections, winning a record number of seats. The BfV, Germany's intelligence agency, stated that the AfD aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society. The new classification gives authorities greater powers to monitor the AfD. Some officials are calling for a ban on the AfD.</p>

          <p>Conservatives in Canada are blaming each other for their recent election loss, highlighting divisions within the party. The party had lost a significant lead in opinion polls and failed to win the election. While they gained seats and a higher share of the popular vote, their leader lost his own seat. The party is now working to determine how to move forward. One focus will be on how the Conservatives can hold the government to account without their leader in the House.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will cancel 35 roundtrip flights daily from Newark Liberty International Airport after facing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the disruptions to air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. The flight cuts represent about 10% of United's daily schedule at Newark. Kirby is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions like those in place at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the issues and called for an "all-new air traffic control system."</p>

The election is also seen as a test for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office last year. The opposition has criticized the P.A.P. for the short campaigning period and gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies found in the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Friede endured more than 200 bites and 700 injections of venom from some of the world's deadliest snakes. The research focused on elapids, identifying two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target neurotoxins. This could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites.</p>
