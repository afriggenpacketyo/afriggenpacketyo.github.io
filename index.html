            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Trump's administration's demands for Harvard to reorganize its governance and hire faculty based on political views are a form of social engineering disguised as a challenge to 'woke' beliefs. The article critiques the idea of affirmative action for conservatives and the institutionalization of political identities in academia. Malik emphasizes the importance of fostering freedom of expression and encouraging the capacity to move between different viewpoints, rather than creating politically Balkanized silos within universities, which are cultural changes that cannot be remedied through state mandates or bureaucratic procedures.</p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after a suspension of over 24 hours due to track-switching work for a new route to improve access to Haneda airport. The suspension affected approximately 550,000 people, as East Japan Railway Co. carried out platform expansion work and relocated tracks at Tamachi Station. The new route is scheduled to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031, enhancing transportation infrastructure in central Tokyo.</p>
