          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate it will strengthen again, remaining a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of the week. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its increased size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast. The storm is currently undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that could result in it emerging even stronger.</p>

Carter quipped on social media that the play might be the Jets' "only highlight" of the upcoming season. The third overall draft pick has been impressive during training camp and preseason, generating significant quarterback pressure. His confident comment adds a layer of tension to the crosstown rivalry, even though the teams only face each other in the regular season every four years.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan have started to return. Their departure denied the state legislature the quorum needed to pass the measure, which could add five new Republican-leaning seats. In response, a Texas judge issued a restraining order preventing a political group led by Beto O’Rourke from sending funds to the lawmakers. With a new special session underway, Republicans have threatened arrests to compel attendance, while Democrats are assessing if enough members have returned to constitute a quorum.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old boy from La Puente was fatally shot at a large house party in Covina, California, on a Saturday night. Police responded to reports of gunfire and found a large crowd, but the victim had already been transported to a local hospital by other attendees, where he was pronounced dead. As of Sunday, no arrests have been made, and authorities are investigating the circumstances that led to the shooting. No other injuries were reported from the incident, and police have not confirmed the specific nature of the gathering.</p>

          <p>An error by Manchester United's backup goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir, led to a 1-0 opening day defeat against Arsenal, reigniting debate over the team's goalkeeping situation. Manager Ruben Amorim selected Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana, and a mishandled corner allowed Arsenal to score the decisive goal. Despite a summer spending spree focused on improving the attack, the club's goalkeeping position remains a point of concern. Amorim defended his player, but the mistake has intensified scrutiny on whether United has a reliable number-one goalkeeper for the season.</p>

          <p>Iraqi officials have started the preliminary excavation of a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be one of the largest mass graves left by the Islamic State group. The site, known as al-Khasfa, may contain the bodies of thousands of victims, primarily Iraqi security personnel and minority groups like the Yazidis, who were executed a decade ago. The initial phase involves collecting surface remains and DNA samples from families of the missing to build a database for identification. A full exhumation will require international assistance due to the site's complexity, including unexploded ordnance.</p>

          <p>Some businesses in Florida's beach cities are reporting a significant downturn this summer, with some experiencing a 30% drop in activity, creating a 'ghost town' feel despite steady overall visitor numbers. This slowdown is attributed to economic pressures on American consumers, who are cutting back on travel spending due to persistent inflation and a gloomy economic outlook. While statewide tourism figures remain strong, the slump in local spending indicates that visitors are on tighter budgets. For travelers, this situation may present an opportunity to find discounts on lodging, attractions, and dining in traditionally popular destinations. (not investment advice)</p>

For many Ukrainians, surrendering the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk, regions rich in resources and history, would be a tragic betrayal after years of costly fighting. While polls show a majority oppose formal land concessions, the deep fatigue from the war has led some to prioritize saving lives over territory.

The administration's goal is to facilitate a final agreement that ends the conflict and allows Ukraine to rebuild with security guarantees.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil liberty and anti-racism groups, including Liberty and Big Brother Watch, has called on London's Metropolitan Police to cancel plans to use live facial recognition (LFR) technology at the upcoming Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to the commissioner, the organizations described LFR as a "mass surveillance tool" that is inappropriate for a major cultural celebration. They raised concerns about the technology's potential for racial bias and inaccuracy, particularly for women and people of color. The Met Police defends its use, stating the technology is accurate and will help keep attendees safe.</p>

          <p>Two American tourists, both passengers on Carnival cruise ships, died in separate drowning incidents at the cruise line's new private resort in the Bahamas. The Royal Bahamas Police Force reported that a 79-year-old man lost consciousness while snorkeling on Friday morning, and a 74-year-old woman lost consciousness while swimming in a pool that afternoon. Both were pulled from the water by lifeguards who administered CPR, but they were ultimately pronounced dead. The resort, Celebration Key on Grand Bahama Island, is exclusively for Carnival passengers, and investigations into both deaths are ongoing.</p>

          <h2>Ancient Dental Remains in China Suggest Complex Human Evolutionary History</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of 300,000-year-old dental remains from a Chinese archaeological site reveals a surprising mix of archaic and modern human traits. The teeth exhibit features typical of older hominins like Homo erectus, such as strong roots, alongside advanced traits seen in Homo sapiens, like smoother surfaces. This "mosaic" suggests that human evolution in Asia was not a simple, linear process and that interbreeding with more archaic species may have occurred. The findings challenge previous timelines, indicating that modern human features were emerging in Asia much earlier than previously believed.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Spain are battling to control numerous wildfires as the country endures a severe heatwave lasting over two weeks, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 F). The fires have already claimed at least three lives, destroyed over a thousand square kilometers of forest, and forced thousands to evacuate. The government has deployed military emergency units to assist firefighting efforts in the worst-affected regions, including Galicia, Castile and Leon, and Extremadura. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has pledged government assistance and emphasized the need to adapt to the climate emergency.</p>

          <h2>Trump Reverses Stance on Ukraine Ceasefire, Now Pushing for Direct Peace Agreement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has shifted his position on ending the war in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than an immediate ceasefire. This change aligns him with Putin's stance and puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who favors a ceasefire first to halt the fighting before complex negotiations. Trump's reversal came after he had previously warned of "severe consequences" if a ceasefire was not achieved. The new approach will be a central topic during Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to the White House.</p>

          <p>A draft of the Trump administration's upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report does not recommend severe restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, a move seen as a victory for the agriculture industry. The document calls for more precise pesticide applications and research rather than elimination, which contrasts with the strong anti-chemical stance of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his allies. The report also proposes developing a government-wide definition for "ultra-processed food" instead of calling for immediate limits. Officials have cautioned that the draft is not final and could still be changed.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment due to severe emaciation has died. The woman, identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, suffered a cardiac arrest less than 48 hours after arriving in Pisa under an Italian government medical evacuation scheme. The hospital described her as having a "very complex clinical picture" with severe weight and muscle loss, while Israeli authorities stated she had leukemia. Her death comes as the UN continues to warn of widespread malnutrition in Gaza, a claim Israel denies, and highlights the dire humanitarian situation in the territory.</p>
