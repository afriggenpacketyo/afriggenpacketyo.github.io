        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension, following extensive "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The initial suspension stemmed from Kimmel's controversial remarks regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Disney characterized as "ill-timed and insensitive" amidst national grief. This development unfolded amidst a heated national debate over free speech, including threats of regulatory action from the FCC and significant backlash from Hollywood figures and political commentators who viewed the suspension as censorship. However, Sinclair Broadcast Group indicated it would continue to preempt the show with alternative news programming on its affiliate stations, highlighting persistent tensions within the media landscape.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani withdrew from a televised town hall hosted by a local ABC station, protesting the network’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. Mamdani criticized corporate leaders for prioritizing profits over upholding press freedom, condemning what he perceived as "cowardice" in the face of authoritarian pressures from the Trump administration. He highlighted the broader implications for free speech, arguing that such actions send a message that constitutional rights are no longer guaranteed, impacting media workers and the public. This protest underscored the significant political fallout and widespread backlash against ABC's initial decision to pull Kimmel's show from the airwaves.</p>

This popular event, which began in 2014, showcases the brown bears of Brooks River and aims to make the remote park more accessible through livestreams. Bears can gain up to 700 pounds, reaching over 1,400 pounds, as accumulating sufficient fat stores is crucial for their survival through the harsh winter.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security criticized Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker for allegedly failing to assist in responding to chaotic anti-ICE protests in a Chicago suburb, where federal authorities deployed tear gas. DHS labeled the protesters "rioters," reporting 16 arrests for actions like blocking facilities, throwing objects, and assaulting law enforcement. Governor Pritzker's spokesperson denied the state obstructed federal officials, emphasizing the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement and respecting rights to peaceful protest. DHS asserted the protests disrupted operations targeting convicted criminals, including drug traffickers and domestic abusers, highlighting a tense federal-state clash over immigration enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a substantial increase from previous costs ranging from $2,000 to $5,000. This one-time payment, effective immediately for new applicants, aims to encourage companies to hire American workers and is not applicable to renewals or current visa holders.

          <p>The Trump administration, led by President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recommended that pregnant women limit Tylenol use due to an unproven link to autism.

The FDA's subsequent note to doctors was more measured, acknowledging an "ongoing area of scientific debate" without establishing a causal relationship.

          <p>A commentary piece implores Jimmy Kimmel to return to his show undaunted and continue satirizing President Trump, framing it as a "patriotic duty" essential for free speech. The article argues that self-censorship, especially by influential figures, fuels authoritarianism and that humor is a vital tool against would-be dictators. It criticizes the "MAGA movement's" redefinition of patriotism and highlights other instances of perceived administration pressure on free expression and journalists. The author suggests that sustained comedic pushback can effectively challenge power and preserve democratic values, drawing parallels to historical suppression of comedians.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration closed a federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, the former "border czar," who was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. Homan, a prominent figure in the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, had allegedly promised to help secure government contracts. The White House denied the allegations, calling the investigation "entrapment" and "weaponization of the Biden DOJ." This incident contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting the politicization of the Justice Department under the Trump administration, raising significant ethical and legal concerns about accountability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration sanctioned Viviane Barci de Moraes, wife of Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, and revoked the U.S. visa of Solicitor-General Jorge Messias. These actions follow Justice de Moraes's role in sentencing former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup. The U.S. State Department justified the sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act, accusing de Moraes of weaponizing courts and suppressing free expression. This marks the latest in a series of unilateral attacks by the Trump administration against Brazilian authorities, prompting strong condemnation from Brazil's judiciary as an assault on international law and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a Salvadoran journalist detained by ICE while reporting, faces imminent deportation after the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened his 13-year-old case and denied bond. Guevara, who has a work permit and a path to citizenship through his adult son, was arrested for obstruction, though local charges were later dropped. The ACLU, part of his legal team, has called for an emergency hearing, arguing his detention and potential deportation are unjust and stifle press freedom. This case highlights concerns about the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement and its impact on journalists and constitutional rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications has created confusion among immigrant workers and employers, especially regarding travel for current visa holders. While the White House clarified the one-time fee applies only to new applicants, immigration attorneys advise existing H-1B holders against leaving the U.S. until further guidance is issued. This uncertainty stems from ambiguous language in the proclamation, potentially affecting those applying for renewals or employer changes if they travel. The fee is expected to deter many employers due to the significantly increased cost, impacting the skilled workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched the "Trump Gold Card," a new immigration pathway offering wealthy foreigners fast-track permanent residency in exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This program, alongside increased H-1B visa fees, signifies a shift in immigration policy to prioritize personal riches as a qualification for residency. Critics argue it redefines the American dream as a financial toll, potentially replacing existing investment-focused visa programs. The initiative raises questions about what the administration values in potential immigrants and its broader implications for economic and social mobility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NHS England has launched "Jess's Rule," an initiative urging General Practitioners to "think again" if a patient's symptoms worsen or remain undiagnosed after three appointments. Named after Jessica Brady, who tragically died from advanced cancer at 27 after repeated misdiagnoses, the rule aims to significantly improve patient safety and prevent avoidable deaths. It encourages GPs to consider further tests, seek second opinions from colleagues, or refer patients to specialists for comprehensive evaluation. The new guidance seeks to standardize best practice across the country, particularly addressing diagnostic delays often faced by younger patients and those from ethnic minority backgrounds.</p>

Experts emphasize the need for flexibility and qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to navigate complex economic challenges. The plan is a key step towards China's "centenary goal" of becoming a modern socialist country by 2049, reflecting its long-term vision for economic and social progress and stability.
