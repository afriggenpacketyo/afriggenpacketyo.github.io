          <p>Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, has officially launched its eye-scanning ID project in the U.S., opening six retail locations where individuals can have their irises scanned by an Orb in exchange for cryptocurrency and a World ID. This unique identifier aims to combat fraud and bots by verifying users as humans, integrating with platforms like Minecraft and Reddit. Visa will introduce the "World Visa card" exclusively for scanned users, and Match Group will pilot World ID with Tinder in Japan. The project has faced scrutiny from governments and regulators, but Worldcoin maintains that its decentralized data storage ensures user privacy and security. Optimism score is at 70 because it is an innovative technology, but some people have concerns about its security.</p>

          <p>South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo has resigned, citing a desire to take on "heavier responsibility," fueling speculation that he will run in the upcoming presidential election. Han, a potential conservative candidate, is expected to align with the People Power Party to challenge liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung. With extensive government experience and a Harvard doctorate in economics, Han's supporters tout his ability to address economic challenges, while critics question his lack of elected office experience and strong political base. Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok will serve as acting president until the June 3 election. Optimism score is at 65 because the political landscape is unstable, but this is normal politics.</p>

          <p>Tesla has refuted a Wall Street Journal report claiming its board contacted recruitment firms to replace Elon Musk as CEO. Board chair Robyn Denholm stated the report was "absolutely false" and expressed confidence in Musk's leadership.

          <p>China has passed a new private sector law aimed at curbing "profit-driven" enforcement that unfairly targets non-state businesses. The legislation seeks to address long-standing complaints about cross-regional enforcement and reinforces accountability for officials.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and their impact on the country's economic outlook. While inflation remains above the BOJ's 2% target, the central bank acknowledged that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to global economic slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. Governor Kazo Ueda cautioned that drastic changes to tariff policies would affect the BOJ's monetary policy outlook.

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), a move seen as an effort to improve relations with the EU amid trade tensions with the U.S. imposed by President Trump. The sanctions, imposed in 2021, had strained EU-China relations. While the EU welcomes the move, it maintains concerns about human rights issues in China. Analysts suggest that the lifting of sanctions may be aimed at facilitating trade discussions between the EU and China, but a revival of a frozen investment deal remains unlikely. Optimism score is at 65 because this is a step towards international relations.</p>

          <p>According to an opinion piece in The New York Times, the United States military lacks the personnel and resources needed to fight a major war. The authors argue that the military has prioritized advanced weapons over sufficient firepower, leading to shortages in ammunition and personnel. They suggest increasing investment in active service members, ammunition, new ships, and new aircraft. The authors also emphasize the need for multiyear purchasing contracts to incentivize defense companies to increase production.

          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have finalized a minerals agreement, granting Washington preferential access to Kyiv's natural resources in exchange for a reconstruction investment fund. This agreement, long pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump, follows months of difficult negotiations. The partnership aims to accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery and facilitate the end of the war with Russia. The deal allows the two countries to jointly develop and monetize Kyiv's deposits of rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas, and other natural resources, effectively acting as compensation for U.S. aid to Ukraine.
