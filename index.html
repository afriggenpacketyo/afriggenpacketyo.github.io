          <p>President Trump has announced new tariffs, including a 100% levy on certain imported drugs unless manufacturers build factories in the US. The measures also include a 25% tax on heavy-duty trucks and 50% on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, aimed at protecting domestic industries from foreign competition. While pharmaceutical companies with existing US operations may be shielded, the move has prompted concern from European and UK trade bodies about potential harm to supply chains and consumers. The policy continues Trump's focus on using tariffs to boost American manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Salesforce is facing pressure from investors to justify its significant investment in its AI platform, Agentforce, as its stock performance lags. While clients like 1-800Accountant report major efficiency gains and plan to reduce staffing, this success raises concerns about Salesforce's traditional seat-based software licensing model. CEO Marc Benioff argues that the AI agents enhance the core products, pointing to thousands of new deals as proof of a unified platform strategy. The company's upcoming Dreamforce conference is seen as a critical opportunity to demonstrate that its AI consumption model can drive overall revenue growth and appease critics.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, signaling renewed confidence in the manufacturer's quality control. The FAA had revoked this privilege in 2019 for the MAX and 2022 for the Dreamliner following fatal crashes and production defects. Under the new plan, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certificates on alternating weeks, allowing FAA inspectors to focus more on surveillance of the production process itself. The decision comes as Boeing works to stabilize its manufacturing and move past recent safety crises.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice. The charges relate to his 2020 Senate testimony regarding the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference and its origins. The indictment, announced by Attorney General Pam Bondi, comes amid sustained pressure from President Trump to prosecute his political adversaries. Comey asserted his innocence in a video statement, framing the charges as a consequence of standing up to the president and expressing confidence in the judicial system. </p>

          <p>HSBC has announced a successful trial using quantum computing to optimize bond trading, a development it calls a 'world-first' in the financial services industry. In collaboration with IBM, the bank utilized a hybrid approach combining classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor to achieve a 34% improvement in algorithmic bond price predictions. The trial focused on more accurately estimating the likelihood of a trade being filled at a quoted price in over-the-counter markets.

          <p>President Trump traveled to Bethpage Black in New York to attend the first day of the 45th Ryder Cup, the biennial golf competition between the United States and Europe. His visit was described by top American player Scottie Scheffler as a boost for the US team during a challenging time for the country. The president, an avid golfer and owner of numerous courses, has been actively involved in the sport, including hosting LIV Golf events and engaging in merger talks between LIV and the PGA Tour. The US team entered the tournament as favorites but faced an early deficit against the European squad.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest tariff announcement has intensified concerns for the UK's pharmaceutical industry, which was not included in a broader US tariff deal established earlier in the year. The new 100% duties on branded drugs could impact British companies, despite a previous promise of 'preferential treatment' that has not yet materialized. While companies with US manufacturing facilities, like GSK and AstraZeneca, may be protected, the situation highlights the UK's vulnerability and the incomplete nature of its current trade agreement with the United States. The policy also affects European truck manufacturers and furniture makers like Ikea. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan would require employers to use the digital ID to verify a person's identity and right to work, with the system becoming mandatory by the end of the current parliament. While the government claims this will reduce a key 'pull factor' for illegal immigration, critics note that similar ID schemes in other European countries have not eliminated the issue of a shadow economy.

His defense claims he was sleepwalking and had no conscious intent to harm her, a defense supported by a family history of sleep disorders and the findings of a sleep expert. Prosecutors remain skeptical, questioning his account of the night and pointing to the severity of the wounds. The case presents a tragic mystery for a family that has lost a daughter and now faces the potential conviction of their son for a crime with no apparent motive.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to lower the price of its new 'Gold Card' residency visa from $5 million to $1 million has reportedly triggered a surge in demand from wealthy individuals globally. Immigration attorneys describe the program as highly competitive in the global visa market, offering access to the US education, healthcare, and financial systems for a relatively low price. The program, which aims to raise significant federal revenue, still faces legal and logistical hurdles, as the application process is not yet active. The $1 million fee is structured as an 'unrestricted gift' to the government to bypass congressional immigration law.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, North Carolina, the city's tourism-dependent economy is still in recovery. The storm caused widespread flooding and infrastructure damage, grinding business to a halt just before the crucial fall tourist season. Now, as the autumn colors return, local businesses are hoping for a strong influx of visitors to help them emerge from the debt and disruption caused by the disaster. Many small business owners, having exhausted their resources to reopen, say a successful fall season is critical for their survival through the upcoming winter months.</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a significant jump following President Trump's announcement of a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The president explicitly stated the policy was designed to protect American truck companies from foreign competition. Analysts noted that Paccar's domestically produced trucks are typically more expensive than competitors' trucks made in Mexico. The new tariff is seen as leveling the playing field and directly benefiting the company's market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's recent appeal for improved relations with Saudi Arabia was reportedly initiated through back-channel diplomacy by Iran, according to multiple sources. The outreach, made by a senior Hezbollah leader, is seen as a response to growing international pressure on Lebanon to disarm the group. An adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader allegedly visited Riyadh to discuss the matter, urging Hezbollah to show goodwill toward the kingdom. This move indicates Tehran's concern over its Lebanese ally's position following setbacks in the previous year's conflict with Israel, though Saudi Arabia has shown no signs of changing its policy.</p>

          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is being analyzed as a form of 'performative authoritarianism,' where President Trump's public demands for prosecution appear to have been directly met by the Justice Department. This article highlights the contrast between Trump's celebratory social media posts and his FBI Director's defense of the agency's independence. Critics argue that Trump's open meddling undermines the legal legitimacy of the indictment, even if it serves his political goal of retribution.

          <p>An intellectual property attorney advises that anyone starting a side hustle should secure a trademark as a foundational legal step. The expert compares a trademark for a business name or logo to a deed for a house, providing essential ownership rights and protection against potential lawsuits. Failing to do so can expose an entrepreneur to legal action from others with similar branding, even if the side business is only generating small amounts of revenue. The advice emphasizes thinking about the future growth of the business and establishing proper legal protections, like trademarks and copyrights, from the outset.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut has lowered borrowing costs for credit cards and auto loans, 30-year fixed mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high. This divergence is because mortgage rates are more closely tied to the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, not the Fed's benchmark rate. The gap, or spread, between Treasury yields and mortgage rates is currently wider than historical norms. This is attributed to persistent inflation concerns and the Fed's reduced purchasing of mortgage-backed securities, which increases the risk premium demanded by private investors.

          <p>Recent high-profile shootings have highlighted a disturbing trend: perpetrators leaving written messages on their shell casings and firearm magazines. Experts link this phenomenon to a form of 'performative' violence, where shooters seek to broadcast their motives or signal allegiance to online communities, ensuring their message is disseminated by media and law enforcement. The 2019 Christchurch mosque shooting is cited as a key moment that popularized this trend, which has since been seen in other ideologically motivated attacks.
