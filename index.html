          <p>Russia launched one of its largest aerial attacks of the war, firing over 500 drones and missiles at Ukraine. In the effort to repel the assault, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was lost, and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, was killed after guiding his damaged plane away from a residential area. The widespread attack prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its own aircraft as a precaution. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mourned the pilot's death and reiterated urgent calls for enhanced air defense systems from Western partners to counter Moscow's relentless strikes.</p>

          <p>The Northern Irish rap group Kneecap performed to a large, supportive crowd at the Glastonbury Festival despite facing significant controversy. One member, Mo Chara, is currently facing a charge under the Terrorism Act, and the group has been criticized by UK politicians for its pro-Palestinian and anti-establishment rhetoric. During their set, the trio led chants of "Free Palestine" and thanked festival organizers for not canceling their performance amid the pressure. The event highlights the ongoing tension between political expression in music and official condemnation.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential bomb in a matter of months. This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which reportedly caused severe but not total damage, contrary to some claims. The situation is complicated by Iran's parliament voting to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. Grossi emphasized that despite the military actions and political tensions, a long-term diplomatic solution is the only viable path forward.</p>

The jury also found true the enhancement that it was a hate crime, as prosecutors argued Woodward, a member of a neo-Nazi group, killed Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but argued it was not premeditated, claiming Woodward was provoked. After a six-year wait for justice, Bernstein's family has turned their grief into a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward."</p>

          <p>France is leading a â‚¬1.35 billion investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move positions Eutelsat as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty, especially after its merger with OneWeb. However, industry experts are cautious about its potential to challenge Starlink, citing significant disparities in scale; Eutelsat operates 650 low Earth orbit satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. Analysts believe that while Eutelsat may succeed in specific security and enterprise markets, achieving parity in the mass-market broadband sector remains a distant goal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The liquid-fuel rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has been a cornerstone of Japan's space development. The H2A series is now being succeeded by the new H3 rocket. The H3 is designed to be more cost-effective, offering a lower price for launch services and ensuring Japan remains competitive in the global space industry.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”are withdrawing from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel land mines. The move will allow them to produce and deploy mines along their borders as a deterrent, creating what some call a new "Iron Curtain." This strategy is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. The decision reflects deep security concerns in the region and a significant shift in defense policy.</p>

Violators could face fines up to â‚¬700, although there will be an initial grace period.

          <p>A volunteer at a Leicester church has detailed a harrowing campaign of stalking and harassment by a Church of England lay preacher, Venessa Pinto, after he rejected her romantic advances. The victim, Jay Hulme, reported the abuse to both the police and the church, but his complaints were initially dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, who instead accused Hulme of witchcraft. Despite an internal HR investigation finding Pinto responsible, it took 21 months for police to take action, leading to Pinto's conviction. The case reveals significant failures in safeguarding and support within the diocese.</p>

          <p>President Trump's significant domestic policy bill, a package of tax and spending cuts, has cleared a critical procedural vote in the Senate after a dramatic, late-night session. The 51-49 vote to proceed was secured only after last-minute negotiations convinced a few conservative holdouts to flip their votes in favor. The bill's passage through the Senate is still not guaranteed, and it faces further hurdles, including a challenge from Democrats to have the entire 940-page bill read aloud on the floor. The legislation must also pass the House again, where it faces potential opposition. (not investment advice)</p>
