          <p>Former President Trump and the GOP are intensifying efforts to prevent mail-in ballots received after Election Day from being counted, a move they claim upholds federal election law. This push includes lawsuits and new state legislation in places like Kansas and North Dakota, aiming to eliminate grace periods for ballot arrivals. Critics argue these late-arriving ballots are secure and that the effort is tied to unfounded claims of election fraud, while proponents insist on a uniform deadline to ensure confidence in election results. California is also considering legislation to expedite its lengthy vote-counting process to address these concerns.</p>

          <p>In a retaliatory measure, China has blocked European Union companies that do not have operations within its borders from bidding on large government medical device contracts. The new restriction, effective immediately, applies to contracts valued over $6.3 million and also limits non-EU firms from sourcing more than half their contract value from the EU. China's Ministry of Commerce described the move as a last resort, stating it followed unsuccessful attempts to resolve procurement differences through dialogue. This action escalates trade tensions between Beijing and Brussels in the critical healthcare sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old man in Manavgat, a resort city in southern Turkey, was seriously injured after being attacked by a lion that had escaped from a local zoo. The man, who was sleeping outdoors, fought off the animal, named Zeus, before it fled. The lion was later located near hotels by police and subsequently shot and killed. The zoo, which claims to house the "world's largest lion family," has not commented on how the animal managed to escape its enclosure.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the G8's historic Gleneagles summit, which promised significant debt relief and aid, the global political landscape has dramatically shifted, making such unified action seem impossible today. The article reflects on how the post-financial crisis era, a more fragmented multipolar world, and rising nationalism have eroded the solidarity that fueled the "Make Poverty History" campaign. Despite ongoing challenges like unsustainable debt in developing nations, the UK's recent deep cuts to its aid budget signal a retreat from global leadership. This shift occurs even as experts argue the moral and practical need for international cooperation remains urgent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent New York mayoral primary, which saw a long-shot candidate win, is being hailed as a major victory for ranked-choice voting (RCV). The system allowed advocacy groups like the Working Families Party to endorse a slate of progressive candidates without fear of "spoiling" the race, fostering a more positive and collaborative campaign environment. Instead of attacking one another, candidates formed coalitions and cross-endorsed, leading to a more issue-focused contest. High voter satisfaction and record turnout suggest that RCV empowers voters, encourages broader engagement, and can produce majority winners with wide support, offering a potential model for reducing political polarization.</p>

His rhetoric, which frames autism as a tragedy, has also been criticized by autistic advocates and families for being stigmatizing and outdated.

          <p>Jackie and Shadow, the celebrated bald eagle pair of Big Bear Lake, have disappeared from their nest following the city's July 4th fireworks show. The eagles, who are monitored by a popular 24-hour webcam, were reportedly frightened by the loud explosions and seen flying away from their roosting tree. The conservation group Friends of Big Bear Valley, which had opposed the fireworks display, confirmed the eagles were missing the next morning. The incident has reignited debate over the impact of fireworks on wildlife, with naturalists expressing hope for the famous pair's safe and speedy return.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that California's aggressive environmental policies are creating a self-inflicted energy crisis, paradoxically leading to increased pollution and economic hardship. The closure of in-state refineries forces California to import fuel from foreign sources with lower environmental standards, and the pollution from shipping is not counted in state totals. These policies, combined with high taxes and fees, result in the nation's highest gas prices, disproportionately affecting working-class families who cannot afford electric vehicles. The author calls for a more pragmatic approach that balances climate goals with economic realities, criticizing regulators for not analyzing the consumer impact of their rules.

          <p>Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 33 Palestinians across Gaza, according to hospital officials, as the Israeli military reports striking over 100 targets in the past day. The attacks occurred as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to travel to Washington for talks on a ceasefire proposal floated by President Donald Trump. This plan suggests an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release for increased humanitarian aid. In a separate development, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved sending aid into northern Gaza to address severe food shortages.</p>

          <p>Two months after leaving government, Germany's Green Party is struggling to redefine its role and strategy as an opposition party. A new strategy paper from its parliamentary leadership calls for a restructuring to better connect with voters, particularly on everyday issues rather than divisive cultural topics. The party is grappling with the perception that it is out of touch, a reputation solidified by controversies like the unpopular heating law. Lacking personnel, especially in eastern Germany, the Greens face the challenge of rebuilding their connection with the public while still trying to advance their core issue of climate protection.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a faster and more energy-efficient data sorting method that could enhance applications in AI and scientific computing. The system uses memristors, an electronic component with memory capabilities, to perform "sort-in-memory" operations, overcoming the traditional bottleneck caused by separating data storage and processing. This new approach avoids the limitations of existing comparison-based sorting methods. The researchers from Peking University successfully demonstrated the prototype's improved speed and efficiency in tasks like route finding and neural network inference, publishing their findings in Nature Electronics.</p>

          <p>A family that supported Donald Trump's immigration policies is now expressing shock and betrayal after the Canadian-born mother was detained by ICE during her permanent residency interview. Cynthia Olivera, who has lived in the U.S. since she was 10 and has three U.S.-born children, was taken into custody based on a 1999 expedited deportation order. Her husband, a U.S. citizen and Trump voter, said they supported the deportation of criminals and never believed his wife, who has no criminal record, would be targeted. The case highlights the broad scope of the administration's immigration crackdown, which affects individuals regardless of their criminal history.</p>

The campaign reportedly included lobbying officials and promoting Chinese-made aircraft as superior alternatives.

          <p>In the aftermath of deadly flash floods in Texas, scrutiny is falling on the warning systems and whether residents were alerted to the danger in time. While private and government forecasters issued flash flood warnings hours in advance, some local officials and residents said they did not anticipate the deluge's severity, with one county judge stating, "nobody saw this coming." The Texas Division of Emergency Management noted that forecasts underestimated the rainfall, while forecasting company AccuWeather insisted its warnings provided ample time for evacuations.

          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are facing a severe decline, with dozens closing each year due to a shrinking number of members. The number of nuns in Catholic orders has plummeted from over 93,000 in 1960 to under 9,500 today, forcing many to sell their historic properties. This trend is attributed to the church's diminished influence and increased professional opportunities for women outside religious life.
