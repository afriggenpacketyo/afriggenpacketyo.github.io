          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him of India's commitment to cease purchasing oil from Russia. This move is intended to economically pressure Moscow amidst its ongoing war in Ukraine, although a specific timeline for the cessation was not provided. Trump indicated there would be "a little bit of a process" and noted the administration's unhappiness with New Delhi's current energy trade with Russia. India's external affairs ministry has maintained that its import decisions are primarily driven by the need to ensure stable energy prices and secure supplies for its consumers.</p>

Major indices in the U.K., Germany, and France are all expected to decline at the start of trading. This follows a mixed week where markets hit a two-week low before rebounding, partly driven by gains in luxury brands and political developments in France. Investors are now looking ahead to corporate earnings reports and the release of new U.K. GDP data, while also monitoring ongoing IMF/World Bank meetings for further economic signals.

He also expressed concerns about safety and the social climate in the U.K., contrasting it with his new life in Dubai.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing concerns over drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the U.S. The admission follows recent deadly U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean, which the administration claims are linked to cartels. This move has drawn criticism from members of Congress, who express concern that the administration is escalating toward conflict without proper oversight or authorization. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the action, likening it to past CIA-backed coups in Latin America.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has started a process that could bar HKT, a major Hong Kong telecommunications company, from accessing American networks due to national security risks. Citing the company's ties to China, particularly through its part-owner China Unicom, the FCC is demanding HKT justify why its operating authorizations should not be revoked. This action is part of a broader FCC strategy under Chairman Brendan Carr to remove Chinese state-linked entities from U.S. markets. The move has already impacted the stock prices of HKT and its parent company, PCCW.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing scrutiny after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped charges against two men accused of spying for China just before their trial. The case against former parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry collapsed because prosecutors claimed they could not obtain necessary evidence from the government officially labeling China a "national security threat" during the period of the alleged offenses. This has sparked a political dispute, with the current Labour government blaming the previous Conservative administration's stance on China. The decision to drop the case has raised questions about political influence and the handling of national security threats.</p>

This closure removes a critical lifeline in a city where gangs control 90% of the territory and over 60% of health facilities are non-functional.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has dismissed the controversy surrounding leaked text messages from leaders of the Young Republican National Federation, which contained hundreds of racist and sexist remarks, as "what kids do." Despite public records indicating the participants are adults in their 20s and 30s, Vance characterized their behavior as telling "edgy, offensive jokes" and argued it should not ruin their lives. The comments, which included praise for Hitler and calling sexual assault "epic," have prompted bipartisan calls for the individuals involved to resign, with the national organization itself describing the exchanges as "unbecoming of any Republican."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is pursuing a plan to construct a large triumphal arch, dubbed the "Arc de Trump," across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial. The monument, intended to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary, would be privately funded by his supporters and is based on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. This project is the latest in a series of efforts by Trump to physically reshape the nation's capital, which also include a gilded White House makeover and a new $250 million ballroom. Renderings have been displayed in the Oval Office, and Trump has expressed his preference for the largest of three proposed designs.</p>

Guevara described his 100-day detention as "horrible," alleging he was extorted, threatened, and held in solitary confinement. He believes he was targeted for his work as a journalist. Despite having a work permit and a pathway to citizenship, he was expelled after an old immigration case was reopened. Now separated from his family in the U.S., Guevara is adjusting to life in his home country but plans to continue his reporting work.</p>

          <p>California state officials are considering closing a major section of Interstate 5 in San Diego County due to safety concerns over a planned military event at Camp Pendleton. The event, commemorating the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary and featuring Vice President JD Vance, will reportedly include a live-fire demonstration with ordnance fired from offshore ships over the freeway. Governor Gavin Newsom's office has criticized the White House for a lack of coordination and communication, calling the event a "pompous display of power."

          <p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an emergency directive to all federal agencies, warning of an "imminent risk" following a major security breach at technology company F5. CISA confirmed that a nation-state actor gained long-term access to F5's source code and internal systems, potentially allowing them to steal credentials and control targeted networks. The directive orders agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in F5 products. The breach disclosure was notably delayed at the request of the Justice Department, citing national security concerns, one of the first such instances under new SEC rules.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are facing long-term unemployment, defined as being jobless for 27 weeks or more, with nearly 2 million people in this category as of August. This represents the highest figure since the pandemic in 2022. The article highlights the personal struggles of those affected, who are exhausting savings and retirement funds while facing a brutal job market. A labor economist attributes the trend to economic uncertainty stemming from the White House, exacerbated by the government shutdown and ongoing tariff policies. The outlook suggests the job market is unlikely to improve in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the plan to build a local Y-chromosome database, which can trace paternal lineages, has raised fears about increased state surveillance and control.

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Jonathan Rinderknecht, the 29-year-old man accused of starting the devastating Palisades Fire in Los Angeles earlier this year. He now faces three federal charges, including destruction of property by fire and arson, with a potential sentence of up to 45 years in prison. Prosecutors allege that Rinderknecht, then an Uber driver, ignited a brush fire that smoldered for days before high winds reignited it into a blaze that killed 12 people and destroyed neighborhoods. Authorities have not specified a motive but pointed to digital evidence of the suspect generating an image of a burning forest.</p>

Stating that the U.S. has "no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans," the department confirmed the action as part of a broader crackdown on such comments. This move follows vows from top officials to take action against any visa-holders who praised Kirk's killing.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new proposal aims to address the UK's costly and controversial use of hotels to house asylum seekers by integrating them into the social housing system. The plan, developed by a housing association executive, suggests the government fund councils to purchase properties, which would first be offered to existing social housing tenants. The homes vacated by those tenants would then be used for asylum seekers, drastically cutting costs from £54,000 to £4,000 per person annually. This approach would also increase the nation's overall social housing stock, potentially easing community tensions by providing homes for both local residents and asylum seekers.</p>
