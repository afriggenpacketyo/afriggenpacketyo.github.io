          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 15:09:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his intent to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, a move Cook and her attorney assert is illegal and without legal basis under federal law. Cook, appointed in 2022, immediately vowed not to resign and plans to challenge the action in court, emphasizing the Federal Reserve's statutory independence from political interference. This dramatic step represents an early test of presidential power over the central bank, as Fed board members are meant to serve 14-year terms and can only be removed "for cause." The situation highlights a growing tension between the executive branch and the Fed's traditional autonomy, particularly concerning monetary policy decisions on interest rates, which Trump has frequently criticized. This legal battle could have lasting implications for the central bank's structure and operational independence.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated his expectation of soon having a "majority" of his nominees on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, aiming to push for lower interest rates. This declaration came hours after his controversial attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, who is now suing to block her ouster. Trump asserted that a Fed majority aligned with his views would positively impact housing and the broader economy by reducing borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. His comments underscore a clear intention to reshape the central bank's leadership and policy direction, directly challenging the Fed's traditional independence in setting monetary policy. This move signals a significant political push to align economic policy with his administration's goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive dust storm, known as a haboob, recently impacted the Phoenix area, causing travel disruptions and power outages. The article explains that a haboob is a specific type of dust storm triggered by outflowing winds from an incoming thunderstorm over dry, dusty regions. Originating from an Arabic word meaning "to blow," haboobs are characterized by a wall of dust that rapidly reduces visibility and increases wind speeds. These phenomena are common in arid and semi-arid areas worldwide, including the American Southwest, and pose significant hazards, particularly for drivers, who are advised to pull over and turn off their lights during such events.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant political battle is emerging in Congress over the federal government's role in policing Washington D.C., as President Trump has deployed National Guard troops under an "emergency" provision. This move challenges D.C.'s "home rule" autonomy, granted in 1973, which allows Congress to intervene. Republicans are proposing legislation to extend presidential control over D.C. police and alter the Home Rule Act, while Democrats aim to restore local authority. The debate highlights partisan divisions over federalism and law and order, with potential implications for other major U.S. cities and the balance of power between local and federal governance.</p>

          <h2>Cracker Barrel Apologizes for Logo Rebrand Backlash, Confirms Change Will Remain</h2>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has apologized to customers for the negative reaction to its new, simplified logo, which removed the iconic image of an older man and the "Old Country Store" tagline. Despite the apology, the company affirmed its commitment to the rebrand, which is part of a broader effort to modernize its restaurants and attract a new generation of customers. The change sparked widespread criticism, including from prominent figures like Donald Trump, and contributed to a more than 10% drop in the company's stock since its unveiling.

          <p>Iraq is debating a controversial new law to regulate its Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), paramilitary groups formed in 2014, which could significantly impact the nation's independence. Critics, including the U.S. State Department, warn the law might integrate "armed terrorist groups" into the military, potentially increasing Iranian influence, as some PMF factions align with Tehran. Supporters argue it could assimilate groups into state institutions, reducing Iranian control. The bill aims to clarify the PMF's role, command, and budget, but faces strong opposition from the U.S., which threatens sanctions, highlighting the complex geopolitical struggle for influence in Iraq.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, Lyle and Erik, admit to killing their parents in 1989, but their case has long centered on their claims of self-defense due to a lifetime of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. The article details the initial investigation, the brothers' lavish spending, and their eventual confession in therapy, which led to their arrest. It covers their highly publicized trials, where their abuse allegations were central to the defense, resulting in a mistrial before their eventual conviction for first-degree murder. Recent developments, including new evidence and witness testimonies, have prompted a review by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, raising the possibility of resentencing or a new trial.</p>

          <p>New evidence has emerged supporting Lyle and Erik Menendez's long-standing claims of sexual assault by their father, Jose, potentially challenging their first-degree murder convictions. This includes a newly discovered letter from Erik to his cousin, written months before the murders, detailing the ongoing abuse and his fear. Additionally, former Menudo band member Roy Rossello has come forward with a sworn affidavit alleging he was also sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez in the 1980s. These developments have led their appellate attorney to file a habeas petition, arguing the brothers should have been convicted of manslaughter due to their state of mind, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office is now reviewing the case.</p>

Germany maintains that recognition should be a final step within a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians coexist peacefully. This position contrasts with a recent poll showing over half of Germans support recognizing a Palestinian state, highlighting the complex diplomatic considerations and internal public opinion on the issue.</p>

          <p>Germany's auto industry has cut approximately 51,500 jobs within a year, representing nearly 7% of its workforce, making it the most affected sector in the ongoing economic downturn. This significant reduction contributes to an overall industrial employment decline of 114,000 jobs. Factors contributing to these losses include falling sales, intense competition from China, the costly transition to electric vehicles, weak European markets, and U.S. tariffs under Donald Trump. Experts warn that this trend is likely to continue, particularly impacting young engineers and potentially leading to a rise in graduate unemployment, a rare occurrence for Germany.</p>

          <p>A Frankfurt court has ruled that Apple misled consumers by marketing its Apple Watch as "CO2-neutral" in Germany, consequently banning the advertisements. The court sided with environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), finding that Apple's claims violated competition law. Apple had pointed to a Paraguay reforestation project for emissions offsetting, but the court noted that only 25% of the land was secured beyond 2029, falling short of consumer expectations for long-term guarantees. This decision marks a significant victory against "greenwashing" and underscores the growing scrutiny of corporate environmental claims.</p>

While interest payments from these funds are already being used to assist Kyiv, both leaders, citing corporate law and potential liability for Belgium (where Euroclear is based), emphasized the legal complexities and significant financial market impacts of confiscating the capital itself.</p>
