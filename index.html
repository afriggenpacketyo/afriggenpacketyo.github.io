          <p>A recent poll reveals that 44% of Americans express skepticism regarding President Trump's priorities during his second term, despite most Republicans aligning with his agenda. The poll, conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, highlights concerns about Trump's focus areas, particularly trade and immigration policies. Democrats show greater dissatisfaction, with 75% believing Trump is addressing the wrong issues. The poll underscores a division in American sentiment towards the president's leadership as he approaches 100 days in office. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>In an interview, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed the recent attacks on Kyiv, stating that Russia only targets military objectives or civilian sites used by the military, despite President Trump's request to "STOP!". Lavrov accused the Zelensky regime of intentionally targeting civilian sites, unlike Russia. He emphasized President Putin's support for a 30-day ceasefire proposed by Trump, contingent on guarantees that Ukraine won't use it to strengthen its military. Lavrov also highlighted the need to address the rights of national minorities in Ukraine and Russia's willingness to negotiate, while criticizing the West's approach to the conflict.

          <p>President Trump's recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia. Trump questioned why Putin would continue attacking Ukraine while the US is trying to broker peace, suggesting he might need to be dealt with more firmly. This shift in tone provides hope that Trump may not force Ukraine into a disadvantageous peace plan, which would have required them to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian territory. The meeting followed a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv, prompting Trump to urge Putin to stop. Optimism score: 50</p>
