          <h2>TikTok Remains Available on App Store After Attorney General Assurances</h2>

          <p>Despite an executive order from President Trump to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sells its U.S. operations, Apple will keep TikTok on its App Store for at least 75 more days following assurances from Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi's letter to Apple stated that the company would not be penalized for hosting the platform, aligning with Trump's deadline extension. This follows a similar instance in January where TikTok was briefly offline for U.S. users but was reinstated after a letter of assurance from Bondi. The extension comes after Trump announced cumulative tariffs on China, suggesting potential tariff reductions to facilitate the TikTok deal.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi expressed doubts about Donald Trump serving a third term, stating he would likely be "finished" after his current presidency ends in 2029, despite Trump's hints at seeking a third term. Bondi, a staunch Trump loyalist, acknowledged the constitutional prohibition against a president serving more than two terms, enshrined in the 22nd amendment. She referred to the difficulty of changing the Constitution, requiring a two-thirds vote from Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states. Trump's cryptic remarks about other "methods" to circumvent the two-term limit have sparked speculation, including the possibility of Vice President JD Vance running with Trump as his running mate in 2028.</p>

          <p>Probationary federal workers are in limbo following mass firings initiated by President Trump, with legal challenges and court rulings creating confusion. Thousands of workers, including Sara Nelson at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, were initially fired but later reinstated due to court orders. However, many remain on administrative leave, unsure of their job security and facing unanswered questions about back pay and benefits. Legal proceedings are ongoing, with the Justice Department seeking Supreme Court intervention, while some workers have found relief through the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola criticized Manchester United fans for directing derogatory chants towards Phil Foden's mother during a recent Premier League match. Guardiola expressed his disappointment, labeling the behavior as a "lack of class" and stating that those involved should be ashamed. He emphasized that while the issue was not with Manchester United as a club, the individuals responsible displayed a lack of integrity and respect.

          <p>A 52-year-old Chinese woman died by suicide while in U.S. Border Patrol custody in Arizona after overstaying her visa, according to Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. The woman was initially apprehended in California and transferred to the Yuma station in Arizona. Jayapal raised concerns that Border Patrol agents failed to conduct required welfare checks before the woman's death, citing surveillance footage showing her creating a noose with a nearly two-hour delay before medical response. The Border Patrol spokesperson stated that all in-custody deaths are tragic and thoroughly investigated.</p>

          <p>The start of a Champions Cup rugby match between Sale and Toulouse was delayed by 40 minutes after a parachutist became lodged in the stadium's roof. During a pre-match aerial display, one of the parachutists, Captain Yannick Trouillet, veered off course and his parachute became snagged in the stadium's awning. Stadium staff and Toulouse's mascot used post protectors and an inflatable rugby pitch to cushion a potential fall while working to free the captain.

          <p>The BBC has filed a complaint with a UK antitrust regulator, arguing that news aggregators like Apple News and Google News do not adequately credit the original news sources. The BBC argues that minimizing credit undermines the perceived value of the BBC, which relies on a license fee paid by British households. While the CMA's decision would theoretically apply only to UK publications, any change made by the aggregators would likely affect other publishers as well. Apple recently paused AI news summaries after complaints of inaccuracy from the BBC and other publishers.</p>

          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, was placed on leave by the Trump administration for allegedly failing to vigorously defend the deportation of a Maryland man to El Salvador, which a judge deemed "wholly lawless." Reuveni reportedly struggled to answer questions about the deportation and acknowledged a lack of evidence justifying it. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Reuveni was no longer working on the case or in the Justice Department, emphasizing the need to vigorously argue on behalf of the client. The administration maintains that the deportation was erroneous, while the judge asserted there were no legal grounds for the man's arrest, detention, or removal.</p>

          <p>California has an opportunity to reduce emissions and improve climate resilience by investing in climate-smart agriculture practices on farms and ranches. State programs help farmers adopt environmentally friendly methods, such as planting perennials and using cover crops, which increase soil carbon and improve water retention. These programs benefit farmers economically by saving money on energy, water, fertilizers, and pesticides, while also reducing pollution. The legislature should allocate 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to climate-smart agriculture programs to support farmers in leading climate action.</p>

          <p>This "Face the Nation" transcript details Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's defense of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, framed as a national security imperative to reindustrialize America and end trade deficits. Lutnick dismisses market panic as a necessary reset against countries "ripping us off." He asserts the tariffs are not a negotiating tactic but a permanent policy to protect American investments and workers. Senator John Barrasso supports the tariffs as a tool against China's abuses and part of a comprehensive economic plan, while acknowledging potential congressional debate over trade authority. The discussion highlights the administration's commitment to tariffs despite market turmoil and concerns about inflation and economic impact.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip have resulted in at least 32 deaths, predominantly women and children, as reported by local health officials. These incidents occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to meet with President Trump in the United States to discuss the ongoing conflict. The strikes targeted various locations, including a tent and a house in Khan Younis, and a bakery in Gaza City, leading to a rise in civilian casualties and prompting anti-war protests in the region. The situation is further complicated by restrictions on the import of essential supplies, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump's reposting of a video that claimed he's purposely crashing the stock market, the president’s top economic adviser on Sunday denied that’s his strategy. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC News that it is not a strategy for the markets to crash and that it is a strategy to create a golden age in America for the American worker. The denial comes after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that Trump's tariff policy will hike prices and slow economic growth.</p>
