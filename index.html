          <p>Alexis Roderick Joel, wife of musician Billy Joel, conveyed appreciation for the outpouring of support following Joel's recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. She noted the family's gratitude for the prompt diagnosis and care received. Joel, 76, has canceled concert dates through July 2026 to undergo physical therapy and focus on recovery, as advised by his doctors. NPH is characterized by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, and while relatively uncommon, it is more prevalent in older individuals, and is typically treated with a shunt to drain the fluid.</p>

          <p>Cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, first identified in China, have been reported in the United States, raising concerns about transmissibility and vaccine effectiveness. While symptoms are similar to previous strains, the variant appears more transmissible but not more severe, according to experts. The Trump administration's plan to limit booster vaccine access to specific groups, such as seniors and those with underlying conditions, has sparked controversy. Experts warn these restrictions could create confusion and reduce vaccination rates, highlighting the importance of continued preventative measures like mask-wearing and good hygiene.</p>

Trump's comments followed Russia's largest aerial assault on Ukraine, resulting in numerous casualties. Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor indicated that range restrictions on arms supplied to Ukraine had been lifted, allowing Ukraine to strike military positions within Russia. This development follows Russia's intensified attacks, which Moscow claims are a response to Ukrainian actions targeting Russian infrastructure.</p>

This decision followed discussions between Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to expedite trade negotiations. The EU's offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table, while retaliatory tariffs on US goods are suspended until July 14. Trump's initial announcement of a 20% levy on EU goods was later reduced to 10% before being increased to 50% and then delayed, causing uncertainty for businesses.</p>

The Fahmi Al-Jargawi School, housing hundreds from Beit Lahia, was struck, resulting in numerous fatalities, including children, many of whom were severely burned. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated they targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center in the area, accusing Hamas of using the Gazan population as human shields. Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia killed 19 people, while a senior Hamas official claimed the group agreed to a ceasefire proposal, a claim disputed by the US envoy.</p>

          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a more nuanced picture of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which includes those seeking full-time work but unable to find it and those in poverty-wage jobs, is significantly higher than the official rate. This measure highlights the struggles of workers who lack steady employment and cannot earn a living wage. The report also reveals disparities among racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers experiencing higher rates of functional unemployment.</p>
