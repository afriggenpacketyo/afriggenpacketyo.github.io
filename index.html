        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its financial outlook for the year, buoyed by increased sales to home improvement professionals which compensated for a decline in demand from do-it-yourself customers. The company's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, although sales fell slightly short of Wall Street projections, while investments in stores, technology, and customer service have helped the retailer navigate current economic uncertainties. Lowe's anticipates total sales ranging from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion for the year, with comparable sales expected to remain steady or increase by up to 1%. Like its competitor Home Depot, Lowe's is focusing on attracting professional clients to counteract softer sales from individual consumers.</p>

          <p>NestlÃ© and French officials are under scrutiny following accusations of concealing the company's practice of filtering Perrier water, which is marketed as "natural." The French Senate released a report alleging that NestlÃ© had hidden its water treatment methods, which include filters and ultraviolet sterilizers, with the assistance of the French government. These methods are said to violate French and E.U. regulations for "natural mineral water." The company defends its practices as necessary to ensure product safety amidst growing contamination risks, while critics argue that NestlÃ© has defrauded consumers by charging premium prices for treated water.</p>

          <p>Target has revised its sales forecast for the year, citing weaker consumer spending, uncertainty related to tariffs, and negative reactions to the company's changes in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The retailer's first-quarter sales fell short of expectations, declining by nearly 3% compared to the previous year, while CEO Brian Cornell attributed these challenges partly to the broader economic climate. Target now anticipates a slight decrease in sales for the fiscal year and has announced leadership changes to address these issues, including the establishment of an Enterprise Acceleration Office focused on streamlining operations and accelerating growth.

          <p>China's military is exploring methods to counter the artificial intelligence capabilities of potential adversaries in future warfare scenarios. According to the PLA Daily, strategies involve targeting the data, algorithms, and computing capacity used in AI processing by enemy forces. Tactics include "polluting" data to reduce the accuracy of language models and employing "logical deception" to disrupt algorithmic learning, which could involve irregular drone maneuvers. These discussions highlight the PLA's focus on "deceptive warfare" to undermine an opponent's AI-driven combat skills.</p>

          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been identified in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The virus was found in samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Britain in 2023, though no human cases acquired within the UK have been reported to date. Health officials emphasize that the risk to the public remains "very low," but experts suggest this discovery reflects a broader trend of mosquito-borne diseases expanding to new regions due to climate change. Measures such as eliminating standing water and using mosquito repellent are recommended to mitigate the risk.</p>

          <p>Efforts to downgrade marijuana from the governmentâ€™s most restrictive drug category have stalled, despite initial bipartisan support. Former President Biden initiated the process to move cannabis to a less restrictive schedule, but resistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) slowed progress, leading to legal challenges. The Trump administration has shown no indication of pursuing looser cannabis regulations, and the DEA's approach has been criticized for thwarting the intended policy change. Experts suggest the window of opportunity for cannabis rescheduling has narrowed considerably.</p>

          <p>UK inflation has climbed to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in more than a year, primarily driven by increases in household bills. Water, gas, and electricity prices rose significantly, pushing inflation further above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Office for National Statistics reported that housing, household services, transport, recreation, and culture contributed most to the rise. Analysts suggest the latest inflation data may reduce the likelihood of additional interest rate cuts this year, while the Bank of England anticipates inflation peaking at 3.7% later in the year before declining.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has affirmed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in Devon, England. Judges unanimously rejected an appeal by landowners seeking to restrict camping without their permission. The judgment centered on the interpretation of a Dartmoor by-law granting the public access to commons for "open-air recreation," which the court determined naturally includes camping. This decision is expected to reignite discussions about public access to land in England, where a general right to wild camp on private land does not exist.</p>

          <h2>UnitedHealth Secretly Paid Nursing Homes to Reduce Hospital Transfers, Investigation Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UnitedHealth Group has been secretly paying nursing homes to reduce hospital transfers for residents, a practice that has saved the company millions but potentially risked patient health. The company offered financial incentives to nursing homes that minimized hospital admissions, leading to delayed or averted transfers for patients who needed immediate care. Whistleblowers have raised concerns about the pressure on nursing home staff to prioritize cost-cutting over patient well-being. The cost-cutting schemes were only possible because of the sprawling nature of UnitedHealth, a $300bn-plus conglomerate which has grown into one of the worldâ€™s biggest companies thanks to its relentless efforts to embed itself into nearly every corner of the healthcare industry.</p>

The suspect, who died in the explosion, left behind writings suggesting adherence to antinatalism and nihilism. Experts say that online ecosystems allow lone actors to find and amplify fringe viewpoints, potentially leading to violence. The internet's role in providing validation and skill acquisition for those with psychological distress is exacerbating the risk of such attacks.</p>

He contrasts this with the current system, where the super-rich finance the government by lending it money, leading to increasing interest payments that disproportionately benefit them. Reich contends that the growing political power of the wealthy to lower their taxes is the underlying cause of the debt crisis, and taxing them would be a fairer and more effective solution.</p>

          <p>An investigation into the delayed evacuation alerts in west Altadena during January's firestorm is increasingly pointing to human error rather than technical malfunctions. The delay, which left residents without timely warnings, resulted in significant casualties. While the investigation is ongoing, evidence suggests the failure may stem from miscommunication or decision-making lapses among county fire, sheriff, and emergency management officials. Some officials have pointed to a gap in communication between deputies on the ground and central commanders, while others highlight the limited training of personnel using the emergency alert system.</p>
