          <h2>Asia-Pacific Markets Anticipate Powell's Speech, Showing Modest Gains</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely saw gains on Friday, as investors keenly awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the central bank's annual economic symposium for insights into future interest rate policy. South Korea's Kospi and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced notable jumps, while Japan's Nikkei 225 remained flat and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged lower after recently crossing the 9,000 mark. The overall market sentiment is heavily influenced by the high probability, currently around 74%, of a potential Fed rate cut at its next policy meeting in September, according to CME's FedWatch tool. This reflects a cautious yet hopeful outlook on global economic stability and monetary easing, despite some regional market variations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stocks, led by London's FTSE 100, saw further declines as traders analyzed the recently announced in-depth details of the EU-U.S. trade deal. This agreement sets tariffs on most EU goods to the U.S. at 15%, including pharmaceuticals, a significant reduction from President Trump's earlier threats of up to 250%. However, automotive stocks fell due to conditional tariff reductions, which are tied to Brussels first lowering its own industrial duties. Adding to market caution, a revised reading of Germany's gross domestic product showed Europe's largest economy shrank by a sharper 0.3% over the second quarter, indicating broader economic headwinds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly scaled back his previous threat of imposing tariffs as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union. New details of the EU-U.S. trade agreement confirm these crucial sectors will now face a 15% tariff, aligning with most other goods covered by the deal. This reduction, however, is contingent on the EU first passing legislation to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods, including agricultural products, before car export tariffs are also lowered. The agreement, described as a "first step," aims to provide predictability and stability in the world's largest trading partnership, though some sectors like wine and spirits remain disappointed.</p>

Despite Trump's repeated attacks and calls for his resignation, Powell has maintained rates, seeking clarity on the economic impacts of policies like sweeping tariffs on imports. Traders now anticipate a 73.5% chance of a rate cut in September, according to CME’s FedWatch tool, marking a potential shift after five consecutive meetings with unchanged rates. This speech, Powell's last at Jackson Hole as chair before his term expires, will offer crucial insights into the Fed's future direction and its stance on the global economy amidst this political backdrop.</p>

This development casts significant doubt on the H20's return to the Chinese market, despite earlier U.S. export license approvals. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged discussions with Beijing regarding "backdoors" and expressed surprise, while asserting the chips' security and commercial intent. The situation underscores the complex trade tensions impacting Nvidia's business in the lucrative Chinese market, which had already seen a $4.5 billion writedown on unsold H20 inventory.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has temporarily halted an earlier order for the mass removal of stray dogs in New Delhi, instead directing authorities to sterilize and immunize the animals before releasing them, unless they are rabid or aggressive. The court also prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, mandating designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action against violators. This decision comes after a previous order to capture 5,000 dogs sparked widespread protests from animal rights activists, who called it "illogical, impractical, inhuman, and illegal." The court cited a surge in dog bite cases, nearly 2,000 daily, as a key concern.</p>

Passengers are strongly advised to check their journeys before traveling, as these widespread disruptions coincide with major festivals and events across the country, including Notting Hill Carnival and the Reading and Leeds festivals.

Rice inflation, a significant concern earlier in the year after surging past 100%, eased to 90.7% from 100.2%, with further deceleration expected in the coming months.

Critics often view Thailand's lese majeste law as a political tool against opponents, but the judges interpreted the law literally, noting no specific names were mentioned.

          <p>Erik Menendez has been denied parole by California officials after spending decades in prison for the 1989 murders of his parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez. The parole panel cited his "behavior in prison," including multiple violations of prison policies since 2013, such as inappropriate visitor contact and drug smuggling, as the primary reason for denial, despite emotional family support for his release. Menendez will be eligible for another hearing in three years, with the panel emphasizing that his past actions indicated an unreasonable risk to public safety. His brother, Lyle Menendez, has a parole hearing scheduled for the following day, as both brothers became eligible after their sentences were recently reduced.</p>

          <p>An asylum seeker named Mohammed, residing at The Bell Hotel in Epping, has voiced a desire for asylum seekers to be allowed to work and live in regular housing or camps rather than hotels. He highlighted the stress and potential for conflict among migrants due to prolonged unemployment and uncertainty about their status, noting that some are "fighting each other in the hotel." Around 140 migrants at The Bell Hotel face relocation after a High Court injunction against its use for asylum seekers. The government aims to close all asylum hotels by the end of Parliament, but currently has no plans to change rules preventing asylum seekers from working.</p>

Honda also affirmed it has avoided direct tariff-related price hikes, attributing this to its high proportion of American-made vehicles. These denials come after Japan's auto tariffs were reduced from 25% to 15% following a trade deal with the Trump administration, offering some relief to the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

While cocoa futures have eased slightly this year, the decline won't immediately affect retail prices, as chocolatiers are still dealing with past high costs.

          <p>An international study has uncovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil composition. This newly discovered mechanism offers potential avenues for optimizing linalool release to combat pests and enhance crop yield. Researchers observed that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage than those at the edges, but also showed reduced growth. The findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, shed light on intricate plant-to-plant interactions and their significant implications for future agricultural practices and pest management strategies.</p>
