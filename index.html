          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash flooding in Texas has climbed to at least 43, including 15 children, as rescue operations continue in the devastated region.

The event has prompted a massive search-and-rescue operation, though officials acknowledge the chances of finding more survivors are diminishing.</p>

          <p>Local and state officials in Texas are facing intense questions regarding their preparedness and the timeliness of warnings for the catastrophic flash floods that killed at least 43 people. While the National Weather Service issued increasingly urgent alerts, some residents and officials claimed they were caught by surprise by the flood's sheer intensity and speed. The scrutiny centers on why evacuations were not ordered sooner, particularly for the youth summer camps located directly on the river.</p>

          <p>A walker in the UK's Peak District is gaining viral attention for kicking down man-made stone stacks, arguing they damage the local environment and historical sites. Stuart Cox's video shows him dismantling stacks built with stones from a historic wall, which he and the National Trust say disrupts wildlife habitats and can lead to trail erosion. While his actions have sparked some debate, he hopes to raise awareness about leaving natural landscapes undisturbed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's foreign policy, suggesting he utilizes the "Madman Theory" by cultivating an unpredictable and volatile persona to coerce concessions from both allies and adversaries. This approach, which centralizes decision-making on his personal temperament, has led to significant policy shifts, such as increased NATO defense spending. However, critics question its long-term effectiveness and worry it could undermine global trust in the U.S. as a reliable partner.</p>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings product offering a 25% government bonus for first-home purchases or retirement, is facing criticism for its restrictive rules. Savers are penalized for most early withdrawals and are unable to use the funds for homes costing over £450,000, a threshold unchanged since 2017 despite rising property prices. While some have successfully used it, many others have been caught by the limits and faced penalties, leading to widespread calls for reform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent budget cuts to scientific research are severely impacting HIV prevention efforts, according to former CDC official Dr. John Brooks. While treatment for existing patients remains a focus, funding for crucial prevention research, including work on a potential vaccine and a cure, has been slashed.
