          <p>A Soviet spacecraft named Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intent to land on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after spending 53 years in orbit due to a failed rocket booster. The New York Times article notes that the spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War space race, splashed down in the Indian Ocean near Indonesia. This event serves as a reminder of the ambitious Soviet Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus and achieved several firsts, including the first landing on another planet.

          <p>Indian officials announced that Pakistan has been moving troops into forward areas, which India interprets as an offensive escalation. According to ABC News, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that Pakistan's actions constitute provocations, to which India has responded responsibly. Indian Army Col.

India maintains a high state of readiness and is committed to non-escalation, provided Pakistan reciprocates.

          <p>President Trump's stance on reducing U.S. support for Ukraine has made it difficult for European nations to provide the necessary weapons, reports the New York Times article. With U.S. aid potentially running out by summer, Ukraine is seeking alternative arrangements, such as sharing revenue from natural resources. While European allies have collectively provided a significant amount of military support, they lack the capacity to fully replace U.S. assistance in the short term. This situation forces European nations to balance their own rearmament needs with supporting Ukraine, straining industrial capacity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for migrants. The BBC reports that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the US Constitution allows for the suspension of this right in times of "rebellion or invasion." This consideration comes as judges have challenged some recent detentions made by the Trump administration in an effort to combat illegal immigration and remove dissenting foreign students. Legal experts have questioned the administration's interpretation of US law, emphasizing that Congress, not the president, holds the authority to suspend habeas corpus.</p>

          <p>In California's "salad bowl," farmers are investing in housing for guest workers to stabilize their workforce amid an aging local population and stricter immigration enforcement. According to the Los Angeles Times, these investments aim to alleviate the affordable housing crisis in Monterey County. While some community members are skeptical, citing the need for affordable housing for local farmworkers, county officials view it as a win-win solution. With increased enforcement and potential self-deportation, California growers are seeking legal avenues like the H-2A visa program to secure their labor supply.</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing for more state laws focused on transgender people, often placing Democrats in difficult political positions, according to NPR.
