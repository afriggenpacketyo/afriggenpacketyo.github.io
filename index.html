          <p>The German government is considering suspending family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for at least two years, a move that would primarily affect Syrian families. This decision stems from concerns about the country's capacity to integrate the influx of refugees, with officials claiming that cities and municipalities are reaching their limits. The article highlights the plight of refugees like Mohammed, who is separated from his family and struggling to care for his disabled son while awaiting reunification. Critics argue that this policy can cause psychological strain and drive some to seek irregular routes to reunite with their families.</p>

Sir Mark emphasized the need for radical policing reform, including fewer policing organizations and a national police agency, alongside financial investment.

          <p>Senior police and security leaders have voiced concerns regarding the government's proposals to release some prisoners early to alleviate overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued the plans "could be of net detriment to public safety." Concerns include the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail if there is a move away from short sentences. The government contends that the announced proposals address many of these concerns, emphasizing that repeat offenders can still face short sentences and terrorists will not be eligible for earlier release.</p>

Ofwat's chief executive stated that Thames Water had failed its customers and the environment, and the fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers. The company faces ongoing criticism over its performance and financial stability, but insists it takes environmental responsibility seriously and is seeking new investment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Nature indicates that fat cells may have a "metabolic memory" of obesity, influencing metabolic pathways even after weight loss. Researchers found that fat cells in mice and humans who had lost weight continued to exhibit unhealthy changes in metabolism, such as difficulty regulating sugar and increased inflammation. This suggests that biology plays a significant role in the frustrating cycle of weight gain and loss. Experts emphasize the importance of healthy habits like physical activity, strength training, and a diet rich in protein, fiber, and phytonutrients to counteract these genetic predispositions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the transformation of the word "pride" from a negative connotation, associated with the deadly sins, to a symbol of empowerment for the LGBTQ+ community. The shift began in the mid-20th century, influenced by the civil rights movement and culminating in the Stonewall Uprising. The word was embraced as a way to counter negative stereotypes and assert self-esteem. Today, "pride" remains a powerful expression of identity and resilience, particularly as the LGBTQ+ community faces ongoing challenges and pushback.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts of up to Â£1,000 each, with some potentially having debts written off, due to the scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies will pay out more than Â£70m in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem. The review found that suppliers fell short of required standards in treating vulnerable customers. A new code of practice is now in place, with stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters without customer consent.</p>
