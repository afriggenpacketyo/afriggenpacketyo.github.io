          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief in Arkansas serving lengthy sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped from the North Central Unit prison in Calico Rock on Sunday. Corrections officials are collaborating with local, state, and federal law enforcement to locate him, though details of his escape remain undisclosed. Hardin was sentenced to 30 years for the 2017 murder of James Appleton and 50 years for the 1997 sexual assault of an elementary school teacher. The DNA from the 1997 sexual assault case was matched to Hardin after he was imprisoned for the murder.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism reveals that sleep enables the brain to flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research confirms that hydrogen peroxide (Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," promoting restorative slumber. The findings offer critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, opening pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Drew Gilpin Faust, a historian and former president of Harvard University, reflects on the original meaning of Memorial Day, formerly Decoration Day, and its significance in contemporary times. Drawing on Frederick Douglass's concerns about remembering the purpose for which Union soldiers died in the Civil War, Faust argues that Americans must not forget the sacrifices made to preserve democracy. She contends that today's challenges to democracy, both domestically and globally, demand a renewed commitment to the principles for which those soldiers fought and died, urging citizens to speak up and stand up for these foundational ideals.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced strong disapproval of Vladimir Putin's recent escalation of attacks on Ukraine, labeling the Russian leader "absolutely crazy." This rebuke follows Moscow's largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, which resulted in numerous casualties and injuries. Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating that his communications are "causing problems." Despite his past relationship with Putin, Trump indicated he is considering increasing sanctions against Russia in response to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>As South Korea prepares for its upcoming elections, many women feel that their concerns are being sidelined by political candidates. Despite their active role in protests against the previous president, issues such as gender discrimination, lower pay, and online sexual abuse are not being adequately addressed by the candidates. Many young men consider themselves victims of reverse discrimination, making gender equality a politically delicate subject. As a result, candidates are hesitant to champion feminist agendas, leaving many women feeling they have limited options in the election.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles, aiming to reduce soaring prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This action addresses criticism regarding the government's perceived ineffectiveness in preventing rice prices from escalating amid broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system. This move seeks to exert greater control over prices and alleviate consumer concerns.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake. This marks an increase from 2022, attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in detection systems. The company's three-pronged process relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions. Paid reviews, often originating in Asia, are considered particularly pernicious, leading Tripadvisor to pose as fake review brokers to gather data and identify patterns.</p>
