          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 07:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A high-ranking Chinese resources official has publicly advocated for the nation to take a more assertive role in developing international regulations for deep-sea mining. Citing China's extensive number of mining areas and diverse seabed resource claims, the official stated that the country should be a key guide in forming the regulatory framework. This strategic push aims to enhance China's global influence and competitiveness in securing critical minerals like cobalt and copper, which are essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles. The statement emphasizes a critical period where international maritime rules are still being formulated.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google with "strategic market status," activating new regulatory powers over its search and search advertising services. This decision follows a nine-month investigation concluding that Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of UK searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation allows the CMA to impose changes to promote fairness, such as altering search rankings and giving publishers more control over their content. Google has expressed concerns that potential interventions could stifle innovation in the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's governing coalition has dissolved after the junior partner, Komeito, withdrew its long-standing alliance with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). This move critically undermines the incoming premiership of LDP leader Sanae Takaichi, who was expected to be confirmed as the new prime minister. The Komeito party cited the LDP's failure to adequately address a persistent political slush-fund scandal as the reason for its departure. Without Komeito's support in parliament, Takaichi's majority has vanished, casting significant doubt on her ability to lead the country and potentially triggering a period of political instability.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare at his party's annual conference that they are prepared to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party. He will argue that change in Wales is inevitable and will position Plaid Cymru as the primary alternative for voters wanting to prevent a victory by Reform UK in the next Senedd election. For a century, Labour has dominated Welsh politics, but recent polls suggest a tighter race. Plaid Cymru aims to broaden its appeal beyond its traditional strongholds by focusing on a platform of new energy and ideas rather than making independence the central issue.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair from eleven to five following a series of intensive interviews. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, former economic advisor Kevin Hassett, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is reportedly seeking a candidate open to new ideas on monetary policy and willing to potentially scale back the Fed's size and scope. The final decision will be made by President Trump after another round of interviews, likely after Thanksgiving. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze accused foreign entities of meddling and announced a policy of "zero sympathy" for the movement.

          <p>Chinese regulators have opened an antitrust investigation into U.S. chip manufacturer Qualcomm regarding its acquisition of Israeli firm Autotalks, causing the company's shares to fall. China's State Administration of Market Regulation announced the probe, suspecting that the deal violates the country's anti-monopoly laws. This move marks another escalation in the tech tensions between Beijing and Washington, following a similar investigation into Nvidia and new Chinese export controls on rare earths. U.S. tech companies have increasingly become targets for Chinese regulators ahead of anticipated meetings between the leaders of both nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Israeli Cabinet's approval of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli forces have started to withdraw troops from Gaza, marking a significant step toward ending the two-year war. The initial phase of the deal focuses on the release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. As troops pull back to a buffer zone, Palestinian residents have begun gathering near Gaza City, expressing hope to return to their homes. The agreement, brokered with U.S. involvement, leaves critical questions about Gaza's future governance and reconstruction unresolved, but brings a halt to a devastating conflict.</p>

He stated that he was exercising his fundamental rights as he could no longer perform his work under the circumstances.

Weiss, who founded the popular heterodox publication The Free Press after a high-profile departure from The New York Times, was brought in after Paramount acquired her startup for $150 million. Her elevation is viewed by some as an attempt by ownership to align the network more closely with the Trump administration, while others see it as a bid to restore balance and win back viewers alienated by perceived liberal bias.

          <p>Genevieve Shore, executive chair of Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR), has characterized the proposed big-money R360 series as a short-term "showpiece" rather than a legitimate league. She argues that its four-team, limited-game format would not adequately prepare players for international competition compared to the established nine-team PWR. The critique comes after eight major rugby nations announced that players who join R360 would be barred from their national teams. While acknowledging the financial appeal for players, Shore emphasized that PWR invests in developing the entire rugby ecosystem, whereas R360 appears focused on generating profits for a small elite.</p>

The collapse highlights fears about the unregulated private debt market, where a lack of transparency could be concealing systemic risks.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments regarding President Trump's authority to take control of Oregon's National Guard troops for deployment in Portland. A lower court had issued a temporary restraining order blocking the move, describing the president's portrayal of violence in the city as "untethered from reality." However, the three-judge appellate panel appeared inclined to set aside that ruling. The case tests the limits of presidential power to federalize state-level forces for domestic law enforcement, a move typically reserved for governors and opposed by Democratic leaders who accuse Trump of mischaracterizing protests to justify military deployments.</p>

Unaware of its historical significance, she used the marble tablet as a garden decoration and left it behind when she sold the house in 2018.
