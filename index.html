          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of attempting to derail the upcoming peace talks in Istanbul by failing to submit negotiating proposals. President Zelensky expressed skepticism about the potential for meaningful progress, emphasizing the need for a clear agenda and proper preparation. Despite the lack of a breakthrough in the first round of talks, a prisoner of war swap was achieved. Both sides reported explosions and casualties as the talks approached, raising concerns about the commitment to a ceasefire, as Russia's military actions continue to impact Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing cheaper stockpiled rice directly to retailers in an effort to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on households. Major supermarket chains and home appliance companies have started selling the rice at reduced prices, leading to high demand and quick sell-outs. Consumers expressed relief at the lower prices, noting little difference in taste from newly harvested rice. This initiative aims to effectively curb rice prices by bypassing auctions and directly supplying retailers with government-held reserves.</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a member of the Manson "family" serving a life sentence for her involvement in the 1969 Los Angeles killing spree, has been recommended for parole by a California prisons panel.

The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022. Krenwinkel was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder, including the killing of actress Sharon Tate and others.</p>

Critics argue that Lula's actions contradict his promises of zero deforestation and undermine Brazil's environmental credibility ahead of the Cop30 climate summit.</p>

          <p>A proposed tax on remittances from the U.S. could significantly affect African economies, where these financial transfers often outweigh aid and foreign direct investment. The tax, included in a U.S. bill, would levy a percentage on remittances made by non-citizens. This could lead to migrants seeking unofficial channels to avoid the tax, reducing the flow of recorded income into Africa. Remittances are crucial for many lower-income families in Africa, and the tax could negatively impact their ability to cover essential expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UC Irvine's baseball team lost to Arizona State 4-2 in the Los Angeles Regional of the NCAA tournament, failing to capitalize on key offensive opportunities. Despite a strong pitching performance from Trevor Hansen, the Anteaters' offense struggled to produce runs, leaving runners stranded in scoring position. Jacob McCombs' sacrifice bunt in the fifth inning didn't lead to any runs, and a double play ended a rally in the eighth. UC Irvine will now face Fresno State in an elimination game on Saturday.</p>
