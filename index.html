          <p>Watches of Switzerland shares experienced an 8% increase following a trading update and a stock upgrade by Deutsche Bank. The company confirmed it's on track to meet first-half expectations, even with the imposition of U.S. tariffs on Swiss imports. The luxury watch retailer stated they don't anticipate any significant impact from the U.S. tariffs in the first half of fiscal year 2026, as brand partners have increased inventories. This positive momentum contrasts with recent market concerns over European economies and rising bond yields, with Deutsche Bank upgrading the stock to a "buy" rating. The firm believes that the downside risk to earnings driven by US import tariffs is much more contained than the shares are reflecting (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Indonesian State Secretariat Minister Prasetyo Hadi has confirmed that Prabowo Subianto attended China's military parade in Beijing, a visit appreciated by the Chinese foreign ministry. The visit occurred despite ongoing protests within Indonesia. Prabowo is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the one-day trip, before returning to Indonesia on the same day. It is unclear whether Prabowo will meet with other Southeast Asian leaders who are also attending the parade, such as Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim and Myanmar's junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. The attendance underscores Indonesia's engagement with China despite internal political challenges.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in Beijing after attending China's military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. Putin thanked Kim for North Korean soldiers' "heroic" fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, specifically in the Kursk region. Kim expressed that cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow has significantly strengthened since their strategic partnership pact last June and offered further assistance to Russia. Trump expressed disappointment in Putin for failing to reach a peace deal with Ukraine and accused Xi, Putin, and Kim of conspiring against the US. The meeting highlights the strengthening ties between Russia and North Korea amid international concerns. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing conflict and geopolitical tensions.</p>

Google avoids a forced breakup, as the judge decided not to require the company to spin off its Chrome browser, despite requests from government lawyers. The emergence of generative AI has altered the landscape, with Judge Mehta noting that companies in the AI space pose a competitive threat to Google that traditional search companies couldn't. While Google must share some data with competitors and allow them to display Google search results as their own, the ruling is not considered a major win for the tech industry, as it aligns with previous cases where breaking up monopolies was unsuccessful.</p>

China has ambitious plans to develop atomic energy, aiming to exceed 100 gigawatts of installed capacity. Russia has already aided in constructing four nuclear reactors in China and is currently building four more. Likhachev stated that China requires substantial uranium and nuclear fuel for its goals and will need to develop a new generation of closed nuclear fuel cycle reactors based on Russian technology.

While other European clubs have also made significant free transfers, Real Madrid's consistent success in acquiring top talent for free highlights their unique appeal and strategic advantage.

The club's financial issues, including late payments and an EFL investigation, could lead to a points deduction and relegation. While former Crystal Palace owner John Textor has expressed interest in a takeover, the EFL is urging Chansiri to either fund the club or sell to a well-funded party, and the new independent football regulator may eventually have the power to revoke licenses for football club owners.

The judges found no "invasion or predatory incursion" that justified the use of the act, while one judge dissented, arguing the court was second-guessing Trump's conduct of foreign affairs.

          <p>China held a highly choreographed military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, displaying its ambitions, alliances, and expanding influence. The parade featured thousands of soldiers marching through Tiananmen Square, with President Xi Jinping looking on, as well as over two dozen world leaders in attendance, including Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un. Xi stated that China is "never intimidated by any bullies" and criticized President Trump's approach to global relations. Trump accused Xi, Putin, and Kim of conspiring against the United States as military hardware was displayed.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of conspiring against the US with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump's comments coincided with China hosting world leaders at its Victory Day parade in Beijing. He also referenced the US's support for China during World War II, as China's parade marked 80 years since Japan's surrender. China has sought to position itself as a possible counterweight to the US since Trump's tariffs have rocked the global economic and political order, but Trump said that China needs the US more than the US needs China.</p>

          <p>Protests against tourists are increasing in frequency and size as residents feel the impact of overtourism, especially after experiencing cities without tourists during the pandemic. Demonstrations, like those in Mexico City and Barcelona, have involved slogans like "Gringos leave" and damage to property. Residents often resort to protests due to fragmented tourism policymaking and a loss of faith in the government. While protests can make travelers feel unwelcome, their long-term effects are limited, and cities often respond with symbolic policies. Academics suggest solutions such as reducing short-term rentals, increasing tourist taxes, and including local communities in tourism development.</p>

          <p>President Trump claims the US carried out a strike against a drug-carrying vessel in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 "Narcoterrorists" associated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The vessel was allegedly transporting illegal narcotics bound for the US in international waters. Trump stated that US forces "shot out" the boat and that he was briefed on the incident by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Venezuela's communications minister suggested the video shared by Trump was created with artificial intelligence, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the vessel departed from Venezuela and was operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has released tens of thousands of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, provided by the Department of Justice.

The Trump administration has faced criticism for its handling of the Epstein case, with some accusing authorities of shielding information. House Oversight Committee members met with Epstein victims, and the committee intends to expand the scope of the investigation, though some believe the released documents are heavily redacted.</p>

          <p>The release of 33,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein by the US House committee has been met with skepticism, as Democrat members of Congress claim that 97% were already public. The limited release has fueled the view that the whole truth is being covered up, leading to outrage among Epstein victims and calls for a full disclosure of all files. While Republicans have joined Democrats in backing a petition to force disclosure, the Trump MAGA base remains particularly invested in the story. The partial release is seen as a strategy to protect the guilty, further angering the survivors at the center of the story.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers onto the streets of Los Angeles was illegal. The judge accused the White House of turning National Guard soldiers and marines into a "national police force," breaching a law from 1878. Trump had deployed the troops against the wishes of the local government, describing LA as an "invaded" city and the protests as a "full-blown assault on peace." The ruling is a blow to Trump's ambition to federalize Democrat-run cities and deploy the National Guard in other states, but the legal judgment is being appealed.</p>

The legislation is a response to the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaign, which has thrown communities into turmoil. The bill is backed by the state superintendent of public instruction, who stated that immigrant families are living in fear and that schools must remain safe places for learning.</p>
