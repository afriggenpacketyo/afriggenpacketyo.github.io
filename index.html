          <h2>US Concerned About China's Increased Military Training and Aid to Africa</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 04:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is increasingly concerned about China's growing military influence in Africa, particularly the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) training programs for African military officers. General Michael Langley, head of US Africa Command (AFRICOM), noted that China is attempting to replicate US programs like the International Military Education and Training (IMET). This warning comes as the US shifts from providing military aid to encouraging African countries to become self-reliant. China has become a major supplier of military equipment, especially in the Sahel region, as junta-led leaders move away from Western partners. The US is warily observing China's growing presence and influence in African military affairs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England and Wales, effective from 09:00 to 18:00 BST on Saturday. The warning indicates potential for 10-15mm of rain in under an hour, with some areas possibly seeing 30-40mm over several hours. The weather agency cautioned about frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds, which could disrupt transport, delay train services, and cause short-term power outages, and potential lightning strikes may damage buildings. The unsettled weather follows a record-breaking dry spring, with some places potentially receiving more rainfall on Saturday than in the entire month of May. These storms are expected to ease off in the west from mid-afternoon. The weather today will bring a mix of showers and potential disruptions, but the severity will vary across regions. </p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been excluded from England's squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra. Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher and Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins were also left out of the matchday squad, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting his omission is related to his fitness. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, has not yet played under Tuchel after missing the German's first camp due to injury. The team is proceeding cautiously to ensure his full recovery and readiness for future matches.</p>

          <p>The Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary group, has announced its departure from Mali after assisting the Malian junta in regaining control over regional centers during a three-and-a-half-year engagement fighting Islamist insurgents.

The Africa Corps stated that Wagner's departure will not alter their operations, and approximately 2,000 mercenaries remain deployed in Mali.

Cameroon is dealing with two main conflicts: a civil war in the western regions and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants.
