          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a third victory over Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship via a majority decision. The judges scored the bout 97-93, 97-93, and 95-95, concluding the historic rivalry in women's boxing. While less explosive than their previous encounters, the fight was a tactical and gripping contest where Taylor's smarter, more economical boxing ultimately proved decisive. Following the win, the 39-year-old Taylor remained non-committal about her future in the sport, suggesting she will take time to decide her next steps.</p>

          <p>The owner of a luxury penthouse on London's Park Lane has been in a prolonged legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed and his family. The dispute, which began over a lift installation agreement, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the malicious use of a noisy lift to disturb sleep. This conflict highlights the combative business practices associated with Al Fayed's empire. The article also notes that the building next door, 60 Park Lane, was the site where multiple women alleged Al Fayed sexually assaulted them, with four saying they were raped.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Starter Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs and allowing the Giants to build a significant lead. Although the Dodgers' bats came alive to score five runs against Giants ace Logan Webb, they were unable to complete the comeback. The loss marks the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and shrinks their division lead to four games as they approach the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of the man, Sedrick T. Stevenson, smiling broadly while being escorted by multiple officers on a plane. Stevenson, who was wanted on multiple charges, had initially slipped away from an agent at a ticket counter. His secure return involved a coordinated effort between U.S. Marshals and various Seattle-area law enforcement agencies to prevent another escape attempt.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Raja Shehadeh argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah constitutes a plan for a crime against humanity, likening it to a concentration camp. He contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, citing the lack of enforcement of UN resolutions and the continued Western support for Israel. Shehadeh suggests that hope lies not in legal frameworks but in Palestinian resilience and the eventual emergence of truth about the suffering in Gaza. He concludes that humanity, rather than law, will ultimately hold Israel and its allies accountable.</p>

Hamas has insisted on UN-led aid delivery, while Israel has pushed for a controversial foundation-led system. A significant point of contention arose when a map provided by Israel showed a much larger military buffer zone than previously discussed, eroding trust between the two sides.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups, which accused federal agents of unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like ethnicity, language, or location.

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a US federal court. Prosecutors accused Guzman Lopez, known as "El Raton," of being a high-ranking leader in the Sinaloa Cartel, taking over after his father's extradition. As part of the plea deal, he admitted to coordinating the transport of massive quantities of cocaine, fentanyl, and other drugs into the US. He faces a reduced sentence in exchange for his full cooperation with authorities and has agreed to forfeit $80 million in assets.</p>

          <p>Dozens of independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been abruptly cut off from supplying Jellycat plush toys, a move the company attributes to its "brand elevation strategy." Many small retailers, who have stocked the brand for decades and helped build its popularity, received a generic email stating the decision was final. The move comes after the brand's popularity exploded on TikTok, leading to stock shortages for small stores while large retailers featured elaborate displays. The affected shop owners feel abandoned by a brand they long supported, leaving them to find alternatives for a significant source of their income.</p>

          <p>A plan to dismantle Prague's historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge has ignited a fierce debate between transportation authorities and preservationists. The Railway Authority argues that the corroded steel structure cannot handle projected traffic growth and must be replaced with a new, three-track bridge. However, a coalition of experts, backed by a public petition and endorsed by Unesco, insists the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. The conflict represents a classic dilemma, pitting the demands of modern infrastructure against the desire to preserve a city's architectural heritage.</p>

Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the mass layoffs will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security.
