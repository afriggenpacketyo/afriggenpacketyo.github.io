          <p>A North Korean soldier successfully defected to South Korea by crossing the heavily fortified land border, marking the first reported military defection since August 2024. The South Korean military confirmed taking custody of the soldier, who expressed a desire to resettle in the South. This rare and perilous event underscores the extreme risks involved in traversing the Demilitarized Zone, a 248-kilometer border guarded by extensive defenses including landmines, tank traps, and barbed wire. Despite the formidable nature of the border, such defections, though uncommon, highlight the persistent human desire for freedom and the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two Koreas.</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club is experiencing a significant downturn under manager Arne Slot, suffering their worst losing streak since 2014 with four consecutive defeats. Star player Mohamed Salah is notably out of form, even being substituted in crucial moments, symbolizing the team's struggles. Despite substantial investment in new players like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, these signings have yet to deliver, contributing to a perceived lack of organization and defensive vulnerabilities. The article suggests that what was initially seen as a "blip" has become a deeper concern, requiring Slot to address misfiring superstars and systemic flaws.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Detroit-area entrepreneur Mark Savaya as special envoy to Iraq, acknowledging his crucial role in boosting Muslim American voter turnout for his campaign in Michigan. Trump lauded Savaya's deep understanding of the Iraq-U.S. relationship and his regional connections, anticipating these will advance American interests. This appointment follows Trump's recent signing of a peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which he hailed as achieving "peace in the Middle East." The administration aims to expand the Abraham Accords, contrasting with the Biden administration's perceived failure to do so.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close following a brazen daylight heist where four thieves, using a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift and power tools, broke into the Galerie d'Apollon. They cut through glass panes, threatened guards, and stole eight "priceless" items of 19th-century French royal jewelry, including diadems, necklaces, and earrings adorned with thousands of diamonds. The well-planned operation lasted less than seven minutes, with the culprits escaping on scooters after attempting to set fire to their vehicle. Two items, including Empress Eugénie's crown, were reportedly dropped near the scene.</p>

          <p>The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced a significant challenge after Israel launched air and artillery strikes, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by shooting at Israeli soldiers and killing two IDF personnel. Hamas, however, denied involvement in the reported clashes in Rafah, stating contact with its groups in "red zones" had been cut since March. Following the escalation, Israel halted aid transfers into Gaza "until further notice" and threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing closed. Hospital sources in Gaza reported at least 38 fatalities, deepening concerns about the truce's stability.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde described the global economy as being in a state of transformation, driven by evolving tariffs and the impact of artificial intelligence. She noted that Trump's tariffs have significantly increased costs for European goods in the US, with these costs currently absorbed by businesses but likely to shift to consumers over time. Lagarde also highlighted signs of the US dollar's status as the ultimate safe haven currency eroding, citing the rise of cryptocurrencies, the surge in gold prices, and capital flows away from the US. She stressed the importance of geopolitical credibility, rule of law, and strong institutions for a trusted reserve currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Kelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, expressed significant concerns regarding the Trump administration's escalating military presence and strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean. Kelly questioned the legal authorities invoked for these operations, describing the administration's rationale as "very convoluted" and full of holes. He highlighted that these routes predominantly carry cocaine to Europe, not fentanyl to the US, and worried about military personnel potentially acting illegally. Kelly also hinted at tensions leading to the early departure of Southern Command's admiral, underscoring the need for military leaders to resist unlawful orders.</p>
