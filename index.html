          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a speech at U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania. Trump stated the tariffs would further secure the steel industry, preventing foreign steel producers from circumventing the existing 25% tariff. He also addressed the proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, describing it as a partnership that will keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment from Nippon. The move aims to protect American steel manufacturing but could also escalate trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former Sinn Féin leader, was awarded €100,000 in damages over a BBC story about the murder of a British agent, Denis Donaldson. The court found that Adams was defamed by a BBC NI Spotlight program and an online article alleging he sanctioned Donaldson's murder, which Adams denies. The BBC defended its journalism, arguing it was fair and reasonable reporting on a matter of public interest, but the jury sided with Adams. The Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder, expressing that their tragedy was trivialized by the libel case.</p>

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for expelling transgender troops from the military, requiring them to voluntarily leave active duty by June 6. After this date, the military is expected to begin involuntary separations, with personnel instructed to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth. The guidance also outlines criteria for identifying soldiers with gender dysphoria, including past requests for grooming standard exemptions or social media activity, raising concerns about privacy and dignity. The policies have been criticized as being worse than the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, potentially hindering future employment prospects for transgender veterans.</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is suing President Trump to block his attempt to cut off its federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the broadcaster over perceived political slights in news coverage. PBS argues that Trump's executive order violates the Constitution and federal telecommunications law, which prohibits government interference in public broadcasting. The lawsuit comes after National Public Radio (NPR) filed a similar suit against the Trump administration, challenging the order to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS. The White House maintains that the CPB is creating media to support a particular political party on taxpayer's money.</p>

Sajet, who had been the director since 2013, had emphasized the gallery's efforts to be even-handed in its portrayal of American presidents. This action is seen as part of Trump's broader effort to remove what he considers "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" from the Smithsonian museums.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk deflected a reporter's question about a New York Times article detailing his alleged drug use during President Trump's campaign last year. The Times reported that Musk consumed ketamine, ecstasy, and psychedelic mushrooms, but Musk avoided directly addressing the claims. Instead, Musk questioned the credibility of the New York Times, referencing their Pulitzer Prize for reporting on Russia-gate. Trump, who was present, did not comment on the allegations, and the press event continued with other topics.</p>

          <p>California is contesting the Trump administration's claim that the state obstructs immigration law, requesting its removal from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions. Governor Newsom's office argues that federal court rulings have rejected the notion that California's law limiting law enforcement coordination with immigration authorities unlawfully obstructs federal immigration laws. The state's sanctuary policies aim to prevent local law enforcement resources from being used to round up law-abiding immigrants while still allowing cooperation with federal authorities in cases involving felonies or certain misdemeanors. The Trump administration's threat to withhold federal dollars poses a challenge for California, which faces a state budget deficit.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has recognized a pattern in President Trump's trade policy, dubbed the "TACO trade," which stands for "Trump always chickens out." Markets tend to go down when Trump announces new tariffs, but investors have learned to buy the dip, profiting off the inevitable rally. Trump has frequently lowered or delayed tariff measures, demonstrating a tendency to fold under pressure. This pattern stems from a misunderstanding of trade and a susceptibility to flattery, making him a desirable negotiating foil despite his unpredictable nature.</p>
