          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt a freeze of $2.2 million in funding, escalating a battle over campus activism related to the war in Gaza. Harvard President Alan Garber accuses the administration of trying to control academic decision-making, arguing that no government should dictate what private universities teach or who they admit. The lawsuit claims the administration's actions violate Harvard's constitutional rights and threaten critical research. The Trump administration has also threatened to block Harvard from enrolling international students and has called for broad leadership reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese and French scientists have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region thought to be involved in consciousness. This map shows connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain areas, potentially revealing how this region contributes to cognitive functions like memory and abstract thinking. The research also highlights structural differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, which could provide insights into the evolution of consciousness. The team's findings, published in Cell, contribute to the ongoing scientific quest to understand how consciousness arises and why human awareness differs from that of other animals.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has launched an experiment to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts, which can reach Â£20,000 per day. The project, developed by Frontier Space and Imperial College, London, involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, with the goal of establishing a pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. Researchers sent a small bioreactor containing yeast to orbit Earth for three hours, and the data collected will inform the construction of a larger bioreactor for future space missions. The ultimate vision is to create factories in orbit and on the Moon, enabling the 3D printing of customized meals for astronauts.</p>

The dollar index also slid to its lowest level since 2022, while gold reached a record high, signaling investor apprehension about U.S. assets.

This is consistent with other marine mammal deaths in the region due to the bloom, which began earlier than usual this year. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the algae, accumulates in fish consumed by marine mammals, causing seizures and other neurological issues. The algal bloom is attributed to upwelling, climate change, and runoff from recent fires. Experts advise people not to interact with sick animals.</p>

          <p>Harvard University on Monday said it has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. In announcing the suit, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a letter to the Harvard community that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants. The lawsuit comes after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for "viewpoint diversity." After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia, concluding a trade case brought by American manufacturers. The Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee argued that Chinese solar panel makers with factories in Southeast Asia were shipping panels at unfairly low prices and receiving subsidies, making American goods uncompetitive. The dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, and anti-subsidy duties range from 14.64% to 3,403.96%.</p>

This statement comes amid increasing deportations of Venezuelan migrants, many without criminal records, under the Alien Enemies Act. Lawyers have argued that the Trump administration is deporting migrants without due process, leading to legal challenges and a temporary halt by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has ruled that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act can continue only if detainees are given due process to challenge their removal.</p>

          <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. The ACLU argues that the administration is not providing reasonable notice for migrants to fight their deportation orders, violating due process rights.

The case has drawn comparisons to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and has sparked protests against the administration's immigration policies.</p>
