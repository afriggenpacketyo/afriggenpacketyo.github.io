        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since Donald Trump's second term began in January, reversing a five-decade growth trend. A Pew Research Center study reveals a drop from 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June, with 750,000 immigrant workers leaving the US labor force. This decline is attributed to a combination of Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration and previous Biden administration restrictions on asylum applications. The article highlights a notable shift in US demographics and labor force composition due to evolving immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A disability charity is advocating for all UK airports to eliminate drop-off fees for blue badge holders, citing the inconsistent and complex nature of current policies. While some airports offer exemptions, many still impose charges or provide less convenient free alternatives further from terminals. Disabled Motoring UK argues these fees are unjust and disrespectful, emphasizing that people with disabilities should not face additional financial burdens for essential access. The article details various airport practices, underscoring the need for standardized, accessible, and fair treatment for disabled passengers across the country.</p>

Shane emphasizes that authorities on the platform lacked the autonomy to halt pumping, contributing to the disaster's scale.

          <h2>Authenticity of Alleged Malevich Paintings Found Under Bed Sparks Art World Debate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three previously unknown oil paintings, attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich and potentially worth over £100 million, are on exhibit in Bucharest, but their authenticity is heavily disputed. A top scholar, Konstantin Akinsha, points to incomplete provenance records, noting the works were not documented during Malevich's lifetime. The owner claims they were inherited from his wife's grandfather, an accountant in Odesa, with the lack of records explained by Stalin-era repression of modernist art. While technical analyses date the pigments to Malevich's era, they do not definitively confirm his authorship, leaving the art world divided.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million Americans in the West are under dangerous heat alerts this weekend, with temperatures reaching triple digits in major cities like Seattle, Portland, and Phoenix, a region unaccustomed to such prolonged extremes. This intense heat is exacerbating fire weather concerns and fueling monsoon thunderstorms, which could cause flash flooding or spark new fires. Simultaneously, Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has formed and is expected to strengthen over open waters, though it poses no immediate threat to the US. Lingering rough surf from Hurricane Erin also affects the East Coast.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has reportedly restricted Ukraine's use of US-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) for strikes deep inside Russia since late spring. This move is part of a Trump administration strategy to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin, affecting both American and some European allied weapons that rely on US intelligence. A new "review mechanism" grants the US defense secretary final approval over such strikes, despite previous authorizations for their use. President Trump has publicly expressed his disapproval of allowing Ukraine to conduct deep strikes into Russian territory.</p>

Representatives Ro Khanna and Summer Lee accuse the DOJ of "stonewalling" and are demanding a full, transparent release of all relevant files. The limited new disclosure consists primarily of Customs and Border Protection's flight logs for Epstein's plane and reentry forms. Democrats suggest the DOJ's release of a Ghislaine Maxwell transcript was a diversion from an alleged "White House cover-up."</p>

          <p>Several major European parcel companies, including DHL and national post offices, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the U.S. following new Trump administration tariff policies. Effective August 29, the "de minimis" rule, which allowed duty-free entry for packages under $800, will be eliminated for all countries. Companies cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems for customs duty collection and data transmission. This policy change, which has bipartisan support in the US due to concerns over illicit drugs and unfair trade, is expected to increase costs for imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is rapidly bolstering its defense manufacturing capabilities, exemplified by the construction of a colossal new aviation industrial complex in Shenyang, designed to span an area equivalent to 600 football fields. This massive expansion underscores China's strategic commitment to enhancing its capacity for mass-producing military weapons. Experts note that Beijing maintains a substantial defense industry to support its military objectives, which can be further augmented by its civilian manufacturing sector during times of conflict.

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new sentencing rules that would allow courts to impose non-custodial penalties such as bans from pubs, concerts, sports matches, and travel, alongside geographical restrictions. These reforms aim to "toughen up community punishments" and reduce reoffending, aligning with recommendations to decrease custodial sentences for less serious offenses to ease prison overcrowding. Offenders released from prison could also face similar restrictions and mandatory drug testing, even without a history of misuse. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood states these measures are part of a broader strategy to cut crime and ensure adequate prison capacity.</p>
