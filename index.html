        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, remembrance politics have gained traction with initiatives addressing historical injustices. The National Assembly voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognizing his wrongful conviction and subsequent exoneration. Additionally, a law was passed to compensate returnees from French Indochina who faced harsh conditions in temporary camps after the end of colonial rule. Furthermore, the Assembly adopted a resolution addressing Haiti's "double debt" to France, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations for the economic burden imposed on Haiti after its independence. While some view these initiatives as social maturity, others see them as symbolic gestures in a politically paralyzed legislature.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough expressed his dismay to Prince William regarding the destructive impact of certain fishing methods on ocean floors, particularly bottom trawling, during an interview conducted at the premiere of his new documentary, Ocean. This interview preceded a key UN Oceans conference in Nice, where global leaders will discuss ocean protection amidst threats from plastic pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation. Attenborough emphasized the critical role oceans play in sustaining planetary life and hopes the conference will underscore their importance to global citizens. The UN aims to secure ratification of the High Seas Treaty by 60 countries, which would protect 30% of the ocean by 2030, though concerns remain about the effectiveness of MPAs if bottom trawling continues within them.</p>

Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will now take on a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media for the party.

          <p>Far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, was asked to leave a London Hawksmoor steakhouse after staff and guests expressed discomfort. The restaurant stated that the decision was not about politics but a duty of care to its staff. Yaxley-Lennon accused the restaurant of "discriminatory behaviour" due to his political beliefs. The incident led to a call for a boycott and a flood of online reviews, prompting Tripadvisor to temporarily suspend reviews on some Hawksmoor restaurants.</p>

          <p>Rupa Marya, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, is suing the university for allegedly violating her freedom of speech rights after she was suspended for online comments about Israel's war in Gaza. Marya, an expert in decolonial theory, questioned the impacts of Zionism on healthcare in her posts on X. The university, without naming her, condemned such comments as antisemitic and a threat to patients. Marya's attorney argues her posts did not impede her duties and that her firing threatens free speech, while Marya herself states she received threats due to her posts, which expressed solidarity with hospitals and healthcare workers in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The escalating feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has sparked concerns among some Republicans about potential divisions within the party ahead of critical legislative efforts and the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's spending bill and subsequent personal attacks have reverberated through Washington, where both figures have significantly impacted politics. While some downplay the significance of the conflict, others worry that Musk's departure from Trump's inner circle could create uncertainties for the GOP, especially regarding key policy initiatives and campaign funding. Despite signs of a potential détente, the feud highlights the complex dynamics and shifting alliances within the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist, Dr. Andrew Freeman, recommends oatmeal as his go-to breakfast for maintaining a healthy heart. He suggests preparing oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it lower in calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for added fiber and health benefits. Oatmeal is high in minerals, vitamins, and beta-glucan, which helps maintain healthy cholesterol and blood glucose levels. Dr. Freeman also advises against consuming eggs and processed pastries for breakfast due to their high cholesterol, fat, and sugar content.</p>
