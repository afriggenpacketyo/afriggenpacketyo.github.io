          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe generally find their lives more meaningful compared to childfree individuals, but experience lower life satisfaction. The study, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that the level of satisfaction varies significantly depending on the country's family policies and social support systems. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare and parental support, show less difference in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents. The study also suggests that greater gender equality contributes to higher parental satisfaction, particularly for mothers.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, with experts linking the trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. A 2022 report indicates that Turkey has the highest rates of overweight and obesity in Europe. Social inequality and a lack of coherent policy strategies also contribute to the problem. The Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, but it faces criticism for overlooking broader economic issues and the inaccessibility of healthy foods for low-income households.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's (FA) ban on transgender women playing in women's football has commenced, impacting numerous registered players. The decision, following a UK Supreme Court ruling, restricts participation in FA-affiliated women's football to individuals born biologically female. This has forced transgender women like Billie Sky to stop playing competitively, raising concerns about inclusion and safety. While some support the ban to protect the integrity of women's football, others argue it excludes transgender women from participating in the sport.</p>

The author warns that China may perceive an opportunity to challenge US dominance due to Trump's isolationist tendencies and domestic challenges.</p>
