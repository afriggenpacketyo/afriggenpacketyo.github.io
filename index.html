          <p>Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell pledged to contribute $1,000 to "Trump accounts" for new children of his employees, matching the government's proposed contribution to savings plans for newborns. Other CEOs, including Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon, expressed support for the savings account plan, a provision in the Republican-backed budget bill. If enacted, the program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, with additional contributions allowed up to $5,000 annually. The initiative, aimed at providing a financial head start for newborns, is pending Senate approval, facing resistance from fiscally conservative Republicans (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 Marines have been activated and deployed to Los Angeles as part of Task Force 51, joining around 2,100 National Guard soldiers, in response to ongoing immigration protests. According to U.S. officials, the Marines and National Guard personnel are tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel, operating under rules of force that prioritize de-escalation. They are not authorized to patrol streets, engage with protesters, or detain rioters on behalf of the police, but they will carry ammunition for self-defense purposes. The National Guardsmen already in Los Angeles are carrying weapons but do not have rounds in the chamber and are not using rubber bullets or pepper spray, and this new deployment has been trained in de-escalation, crowd control, and standing rules for the use of force.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This move follows the resignation of a committee leader after Kennedy ordered changes to the CDC's COVID-19 vaccine guidance, and outside medical groups have expressed disappointment over the decision, which bypassed the advisory committee process. The panel was scheduled to vote on new recommendations for COVID-19 and other vaccines at a meeting starting on June 25.</p>

Chris Sutton suggests that Frank will face much more pressure at Tottenham than he does at Brentford, because of the expectation and the manager has to handle that expectation.

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops by President Trump. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, and the demonstrations have largely been limited to downtown LA. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned Trump's actions and is suing the administration, claiming Trump illegally federalized the National Guard. The National Guard's role is to protect federal agents, and they will not be conducting their own immigration raids.</p>

          <p>Sly Stone, a funk pioneer whose influence and impact as leader of the musical group Sly and the Family Stone was as enduring as his career was brief, has died at 82. Stone had a capacity for summing up the zeitgeist of an America in social transition, from collective joy (“Dance to the Music”) to racial harmony (“Everyday People”), and from the search for transcendence (“I Want To Take You Higher”) to the broken idealism in which the 1960s ended (“Don’t Call Me Nigger, Whitey”), a timeline in which he created a template for future generations of funk-rock hybrids.</p>
