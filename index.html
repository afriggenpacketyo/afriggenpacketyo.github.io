          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to resume deporting migrants to third countries without adhering to additional due process requirements that were previously mandated by a district court judge. This decision marks a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the administration's immigration policies, although ongoing litigation is expected to continue for years. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision as condoning lawless behavior by the administration and undermining the principle of a government of laws. A Homeland Security spokeswoman celebrated the decision as a major win for American safety, while immigrant advocates vowed to continue fighting for due process protections. The ruling allows the resumption of expedited removals of unauthorized immigrants to countries other than their own.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has raised the idea of toppling Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, suggesting a regime change if the current regime cannot "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." This marks a shift from discouraging Israeli military strikes against Iran to potentially supporting broader ambitions, a move that has caused division within the MAGA right. While some aides express concern, Trump's actions align with a more interventionist approach, reminiscent of the Iraq War project he previously criticized. The article explores the potential consequences and historical parallels of regime change, cautioning against repeating past mistakes.</p>

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert congressional authority, but its effectiveness has been debated.

          <p>China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, according to a top U.S. analyst. Despite China's reliance on Middle Eastern oil, its approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests over direct military intervention. The analyst pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this strategy. China's focus remains on protecting its economic interests rather than policing global waterways.</p>

          <p>The UK has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, meeting a new NATO target. Of this, 3.5% will be dedicated to core defense, while the remaining 1.5% will focus on defense-related areas such as resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need for agility and a clear sense of national interest in navigating an era of radical uncertainty. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then.</p>

Baker, who previously confessed to the murder, was also sentenced to life without parole.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, prompting discussions about potential retaliation targets. Possible actions by Tehran include attacking U.S. military assets across the Middle East, closing the Strait of Hormuz, and engaging in asymmetric warfare. The article breaks down the potential impact of each of these actions, including the economic and geopolitical consequences of disrupting oil supplies. The long-term threat lies in the asymmetric warfare space and potentially state-sponsored terrorism.</p>
