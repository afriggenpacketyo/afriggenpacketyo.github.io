          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 06:01:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has issued a stark warning to parents about the critical importance of school attendance at the start of the new term. Citing BBC analysis, she highlighted that students missing school in the first week are significantly more likely to become persistently absent, which negatively impacts their long-term life prospects. This call to action comes as attendance rates, while improving, have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, prompting the government to implement support hubs and maintain fines as a deterrent for unauthorized absences. The government is urging a collaborative effort between schools and parents to ensure children get a strong start to the academic year.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for China's commercial space sector, Beijing-based CAS Space has launched two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a Mexican startup. This mission marks Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit and represents a rare entry for China into the North American commercial launch market. The two femtosatellites, each weighing under 100 grams, aim to demonstrate that small satellites can be meaningful and will engage students through low-cost receiving stations. The launch is being hailed by CAS Space as a milestone that showcases its cost-effective and reliable rocket technology to a global audience.</p>

          <p>Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has publicly criticized his club and demanded they honor a promise to let him leave before the transfer deadline. In a social media statement, Wissa claims the club is unfairly blocking his desired move to Newcastle United, who have reportedly had a £35 million offer rejected. The DR Congo international asserts he had written assurances he could leave for a reasonable offer and accuses Brentford of changing its position, now demanding a significantly higher fee. This public stand-off follows a summer of tension where Wissa has not been training with the first team.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people have participated in "March for Australia" anti-immigration rallies in major cities, prompting large-scale counter-demonstrations and some clashes. The events, condemned by the government for having far-right links, saw protesters in Melbourne clash with a pro-Palestine rally and a known neo-Nazi addressing the crowd. Organizers cited concerns over national unity, wages, and infrastructure, while government ministers denounced the rallies as divisive and hateful. The demonstrations highlight rising right-wing extremism in the country, which recently criminalized the Nazi salute.</p>

          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the demand for home air conditioning is increasing, sparking a debate about its environmental, financial, and health impacts. While providing comfort and improving productivity, air conditioning units consume significant electricity and often use hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases. Experts advise purchasing energy-efficient models and ensuring proper disposal to mitigate environmental harm. While concerns about air conditioning spreading illness exist, they are minimal if units are well-maintained, shifting the focus to balancing immediate comfort with long-term sustainability.</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China's President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have signaled a significant move toward de-escalating tensions. During their first meeting in seven years, both leaders emphasized partnership over rivalry and a commitment to maintaining peace and stability. Modi announced the resumption of direct flights, which were suspended after deadly border clashes in 2020. The meeting, which also includes Russian President Vladimir Putin, is seen as an effort by the nations to find common ground amid ongoing trade disputes with the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the death of a baby from whooping cough, marking the first such fatality in the country this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns in their first weeks of life. This tragic event underscores growing concerns from health officials about declining vaccination rates for childhood diseases, none of which met the 95% uptake target in England last year.

Political scientists and activists express concern that these moves follow a familiar pattern of consolidating power seen in authoritarian regimes abroad.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy labeled the projects as "wasteful," stating the funds would be redirected to other port upgrades if possible.

          <p>Protests targeting hotels used to house asylum seekers took place across England and Scotland, leading to confrontations and arrests. In West Drayton, London, five people were arrested after a group of masked men damaged fences and attempted to enter the Crowne Plaza hotel. Police deployed additional officers and used a dispersal order to manage the crowd of around 500 people. Similar demonstrations and counter-protests occurred in other locations, including Falkirk and Warrington, reflecting heightened tensions surrounding the UK's asylum policies.</p>

          <p>In an innovative approach to wildlife management, biologists are using drones to haze gray wolves and prevent livestock attacks in Northern California. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast a variety of sounds, including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," gunshots, and dialogue from actors like Scarlett Johansson, to scare the predators away from cattle. This nonlethal method, developed by the USDA, has shown initial success in interrupting wolf hunts at night. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, it represents a creative technological solution to the growing conflict between ranchers and recovering wolf populations.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. tariffs imposed on Indian goods are providing a new impetus for India and China to repair their strained economic and political relationship. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit is seen as a potential turning point. Despite deep-seated mistrust and unresolved border disputes, the shared challenge of American protectionism may encourage the world's two most populous countries to seek greater cooperation. This could involve easing trade restrictions and resuming investments that were halted after previous border conflicts.</p>

          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after a significant upset victory over world No. 3 Alexander Zverev. After dropping the first set, Auger-Aliassime mounted a strong comeback to win the match in four sets, marking his first Grand Slam win against a top-five opponent. The nearly four-hour marathon match showcased some of the Canadian's best tennis and ended Zverev's tournament run much earlier than anticipated. The result is a major boost for Auger-Aliassime, who has struggled with injuries and inconsistent form in recent seasons.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion for the upcoming Monday drawing after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's draw. This marks the fifth-largest prize in the game's history and the sixth time the jackpot has crossed the billion-dollar threshold. While nine tickets nationwide won $1 million each by matching the five white balls, the grand prize has continued to grow since it was last won in May.
