          <p>A by-election is taking place in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse following the death of Christina McKelvie from the SNP, and is seen as a significant test of voter sentiment in Scotland since the UK general election, and also an opportunity to gauge Reform UK's support. The race appears to be primarily between the SNP and Reform UK, with Labour also vying for contention. Voters have expressed frustration with politicians across the spectrum, citing issues such as the cost of living and healthcare access. Reform UK is focusing on immigration and tax policies, leading to accusations of racism. This election's outcome will be closely scrutinized for insights into voter behavior ahead of the upcoming Holyrood election, and will reveal whether the SNP can maintain its dominance or if Labour can regain ground. The results of this by-election will have a direct impact on Scottish politics and the political climate. Optimism is low as voters are frustrated with the political choices on offer.</p>

It features interviews with people from various faiths, including a Hindu-Sikh couple facing community disapproval, a gay Muslim who was disowned by his family, and a former Jehovah's Witness who was ostracized for having premarital sex. These personal stories highlight the diverse ways religion can influence relationships, family dynamics, and individual identity. The interviewees discuss the difficulties of balancing personal desires with religious expectations, and the importance of open communication and acceptance. Despite the challenges, many find ways to reconcile their faith with their personal lives, demonstrating resilience and adaptability.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly warned Senator Rand Paul against voting against his "Big, Beautiful Bill," claiming it would align him with Democrats and lead to a tax increase and potential U.S. debt default. Paul has expressed concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt, despite supporting its tax and spending cuts. Trump has stated he is open to changes in the bill, which includes tax cuts, Medicaid reforms, and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Democrats are criticizing the Medicaid reform section, projecting that millions could lose health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that millions of Americans will lose health insurance by 2034 due to the bill's Medicaid reforms, although Republicans dispute this figure.

          <p>Wildfires in Canada have forced approximately 17,000 residents in Manitoba to evacuate, with over 5,000 from Flin Flon alone, due to nearly two dozen active fires. Manitoba declared a state of emergency as fires spread from northwest to southeast, affecting several communities. Thousands are also impacted in Saskatchewan and Alberta, with concerns that the number of evacuees could rise. Resources are stretched thin, and officials are hoping for a change in weather patterns. Smoke from the fires is drifting into the U.S., causing air quality alerts. International aid is being provided to combat the fires.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for key sectors like the NHS, defense, and education. The level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other unprotected areas. While spending increased in 2024 for various sectors, it is not expected to continue at the same rate. The government aims to scrutinize every pound spent in the upcoming Spending Review. Prioritizing the NHS could lead to real-term cuts for other departments, posing challenges for improving the criminal justice system and addressing prison overcrowding. (not investment advice)</p>

Business travel is a significant revenue source for the U.S. economy, but a survey indicates that many expect a decline in business travel volume due to U.S. policy. Rising anxiety over U.S. travel stems from stricter border control measures and concerns about potential questioning or detention. The head of an international NGO reported devising a new travel protocol for the U.S., including using burner phones and computers, and preparing employees for aggressive questioning.</p>

          <p>The US has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House, following a UN nuclear watchdog report indicating Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged receiving "elements of a US deal." The proposal's details are unclear, but it aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. The IAEA report revealed that Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels. Iran insists its program is peaceful, while the IAEA report may prompt further action from the US, Britain, France, and Germany. The report creates a delicate balance of potential nuclear proliferation.</p>

          <p>Taiwanâ€™s main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September, hoping a new party chair can lead it back to power. Before the leadership race, the KMT faces a mass-recall campaign by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that could weaken its legislative majority. Analysts suggest that failing to contain the recall challenge could disrupt the KMTâ€™s leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his readiness to step down, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor. The KMT plans to announce the party chair race in July, hold internal voting in September, and install a new leader by October.</p>

The U.S. special envoy to the Middle East has sent a "detailed and acceptable proposal" to Iran, but the details remain undisclosed.

          <p>A new trend on TikTok suggests that a full-fat Coke and salty fries can alleviate migraines, but experts caution that this is not a cure. While some individuals find relief from the caffeine and sugar in Coke, or the salt in fries, these effects are not universal and can even be counterproductive. Experts warn that excessive caffeine can trigger migraines and that fast food is often unhealthy and may contain migraine-inducing compounds. Sufferers share their experiences with various remedies, highlighting the desperation for relief from this debilitating condition. Neurologists emphasize the importance of lifestyle changes and medical treatments for managing migraines, advising against relying solely on social media hacks.</p>

          <p>An opinion columnist suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience is rooted in his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself, a strategy known as "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out) on Wall Street. This behavior reassures swing voters that any extreme actions are provisional and that Trump is willing to retreat. The columnist argues that Trump's recent shift away from extreme China tariffs and complaints about Vladimir Putin have helped his poll numbers recover. Voters appreciate Trump's pressure on institutions they distrust, but their approval depends on him accepting counterpressure and recalibrating his approach. The article suggests that Trump's ability to check himself and be checked by others is a key factor in maintaining his support.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of China posing an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and urged Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war. Hegseth characterized China as seeking to become a "hegemonic power" and is preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia. In response, China accused the U.S. of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace. Hegseth stressed that the U.S. does not seek conflict with China but must ensure China cannot dominate its allies. The U.S. wants to forge a strong shield of deterrence with allies, but deterrence does not come cheap, he said.</p>

The destroyer, meant to showcase North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during launch, causing damage to the hull.

The investment is part of the government's strategic defense review (SDR), which seeks to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity. The UK will also purchase over 7,000 British-built long-range weapons, including drones and missiles, over several years.
