          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, following criticism that the full clawback was excessively burdensome.

          <p>With dropping birth rates becoming a concern, there are discussions on policies intended to nudge people toward childbirth, particularly among married men and women. The article argues that a pronatalist policy that narrowly defines family is a strategic mistake, as it excludes many people who desire children but face obstacles such as finding a partner or affording IVF. Instead, the article suggests embracing existing diverse family structures and lowering barriers for those hoping to start families, such as subsidizing ART and extending family-leave policies to include extended family members who provide care. The Trump administration needs to institute policies that help the actual majority of American families to advance a truly family-forward agenda. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Temu, the low-cost retailer, has halted shipments of Chinese-made goods to customers in the U.S. following the expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption. The move means that Temu's products sourced from China now face high tariffs, impacting the platform's appeal to U.S. consumers. Temu is transitioning to a local fulfillment model, with all sales in the U.S. now handled by locally based sellers. The company is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.

          <p>Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff is attempting to balance criticizing President Trump while also working with Republicans to advance Georgia's interests. As the only Democratic senator up for reelection in a state Trump won in 2024, Ossoff faces a tough challenge. He has launched his reelection bid with strong critiques of Trump but also emphasizes his willingness to collaborate. Ossoff's approach reflects the delicate balance he must strike to appeal to Georgia voters, who narrowly favored Trump in 2024 after supporting Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>The article examines the potential impact of secondary sanctions, which could be imposed by a second Trump administration, on Russia's economy. While Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience despite existing sanctions, the implementation of secondary sanctions targeting countries and entities that continue to do business with Russia could change the landscape. China and India, as key trading partners, could be primary targets. The article considers the possibility that tighter bank sanctions could affect Russia's payment channels, and the potential for Chinese partners to become less fearful of secondary sanctions.
