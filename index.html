          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, escalating trade tensions amidst a gathering of OECD ministers. This move has strained relationships with trading partners and prompted negotiations to avoid the increased duties. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to the tariffs, with the US economy expected to face the most significant repercussions. Despite legal challenges, the tariffs remain in place as the appeals process continues, causing concern among affected nations like the EU, Canada, and Mexico, all of whom are considering retaliatory measures or seeking exemptions.

The prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, is currently serving a sentence in Germany for sexual assault and is due to be released in September, but that could be pushed back.

          <p>Tesla reported a significant increase in sales in Australia for May, despite facing declining sales in the U.S. and Europe.

While total deliveries in Australia were up 9.3% year-over-year, they surged over 675% from April. Despite this rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared with the same period last year, indicating that while the local market is strong, a broader global recovery is not yet apparent.

He hit a two-run home run in the first inning but committed a costly error in the fifth. Muncy redeemed himself with a game-tying home run in the ninth, setting up Freddie Freeman's walk-off double in the tenth. Muncy's recent offensive surge has helped offset his defensive struggles, providing him with leeway to improve his fielding, while his offensive production has been crucial for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue that these protections could harm steel producers outside the US, provoke retaliation from trade partners, and significantly increase costs for American consumers. The UK has been granted an exemption from the increased duties, maintaining a 25% tariff rate due to ongoing trade discussions. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors reliant on steel and aluminum, offsetting any gains in the steel industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Musk's remarks, made shortly after leaving his role in the Trump administration, were unexpectedly echoed by Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders, a vocal critic of Trump, agreed that the bill was an "abomination," citing its tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to food aid for the impoverished. The White House defended the bill, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it "one big, beautiful bill". The bill aims to extend tax breaks from Trump's first term, partially funded by cuts in social benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the exemption is set to expire on July 9, when wider tariff pauses for US trading partners could be applied.
