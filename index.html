          <p>Tamar Kintsurashvili, a Georgian journalist and executive director of an independent media development foundation, has been awarded the DW Freedom of Speech Award for her years-long fight against disinformation and advocacy for civic freedoms and human rights. Kintsurashvili's work involves workshops on fact-checking and countering hate speech, which have become increasingly challenging due to growing repression in Georgia. She refuses to register her foundation as a "foreign agent" under a new law, viewing it as an attempt to undermine trust in her organization's actions. Kintsurashvili expresses that the award offers encouragement and acknowledges the importance of her work for a democratic Georgia.</p>

Auchincloss highlighted strong operational performance, including record upstream efficiency and refinery output, as well as multiple exploration discoveries.

          <p>The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, won Canada's federal election, marking a turnaround attributed to President Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose tariffs. The election saw a record number of advance votes, with voters citing Canadian sovereignty, tariffs, and affordability as key issues. Carney's campaign focused on countering Trump's influence, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was criticized for similarities to Trump. Trump's continued remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state drew condemnation from both Carney and Poilievre, who emphasized Canada's independence. </p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured a victory in the Canadian election, reversing previous expectations of a collapse, but without securing a clear majority in parliament. Carney's campaign centered on uniting Canadians against tariffs and threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, warning that Trump is trying to break Canada so America can own it. The close vote share between the Liberals and Conservatives indicates division within the country, posing a challenge for Carney as he navigates a potential trade war with the U.S. Carney emphasized the responsibility of the government to prepare for the worst, not the best, in the face of Trump's actions.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars has announced a $1.9 billion cost-cutting initiative due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter, reporting a profit of 1.9 billion krona compared to 4.7 billion krona in the same period last year. The cost reduction plan includes investment cuts and potential redundancies across global operations, with the company ceasing to provide financial guidance for 2025 and 2026. CEO Håkan Samuelsson cited market headwinds, price competition, and turbulence from additional tariffs as factors impacting the company's performance. Despite these challenges, Volvo aims for electrified cars to represent 90% to 100% of its global sales by 2030.</p>

          <p>Electricity has been mostly restored to Spain and Portugal after a major blackout disrupted daily life, affecting airports, trains, and traffic lights. The outage, which left millions without power, prompted investigations into its cause, with officials ruling out foul play. Spain's national power company reported that 99% of power demand in Peninsular Spain was being met, while Portugal's supplier, REN, had restored most of its substations. The blackout's cause remains unknown, though officials are investigating a potential problem in the European electricity grid.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a victory in the Canadian election, fueled by anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over U.S. threats to Canada's sovereignty.

Carney's campaign focused on portraying Trump as a threat to Canada's economic survival and sovereignty, a strategy that resonated with voters. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, with the Liberals largely shut out of oil-rich provinces and younger voters expressing different concerns than older generations.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending the sugar tax to include milkshakes and lattes as part of a broader effort to tackle obesity. The proposal involves ending the exemption for milk-based drinks and reducing the maximum sugar content allowed before the levy applies. The government estimates that a significant percentage of milk-based drinks on the market would be subject to the tax unless their sugar content is reduced. The consultation on these proposals will run until July 21, with the sugar tax having raised £1.9 billion since its introduction in 2018.</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap has apologized to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox after footage emerged of a band member appearing to say "The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP." Kneecap said they rejected any suggestion that they would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual. They added that an extract of footage, deliberately taken out of all context, is now being exploited and weaponised, as if it were a call to action. Labour MP Jo Cox was fatally shot and stabbed in June 2016, and Sir David Amess was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery in 2021.</p>

          <p>A Q&A on Formula 1 discusses the reasons for changing regulations, with the primary motivation being to attract new manufacturers by simplifying engine rules and increasing electrical capacity. The 2026 rules retain 1.6-liter V6 turbo hybrids but remove the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo, and will run on 100% sustainable fuel. Moveable aerodynamics are being considered to reduce drag on straights. These changes may open up the field, but it will eventually close again, providing an opportunity for a shake-up in the competitive order.</p>
