        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an agreement between India and Pakistan to halt fighting, both countries accused each other of violations shortly after the announcement. India's Foreign Secretary stated there were repeated violations, while Pakistan's foreign ministry affirmed its commitment to the ceasefire, despite Indian actions. The recent conflict, involving drones, missiles, and artillery, was triggered by a militant attack in Pahalgam, with India striking targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. While President Trump claimed the US brokered the ceasefire, Pakistan confirmed that several countries were involved in the diplomacy, and residents near the border reported continued explosions and flashes. Optimism about the ceasefire remains tempered by ongoing tensions and conflicting reports from both sides.</p>

          <p>Tom Cruise reminisced about working with Stanley Kubrick on "Eyes Wide Shut," mentioning that he suggested Nicole Kidman for the role of Alice, emphasizing her talent as an actress. Cruise described the film as a unique experience, highlighting the constant rewriting and reshooting of scenes to achieve the desired tone. He and Kidman met while filming "Days of Thunder" and were married from 1990 to 2001, during which they adopted two children. The article also mentions Cruise's recent romantic link to Ana de Armas, with the pair being spotted together in London, although a source claims they are working on a project together.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively suspends the use of the 'social cost of carbon,' a metric used to weigh the economic costs and benefits of policies aimed at limiting carbon pollution. Jeffrey B. Clark, acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, expressed doubts about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and economists criticize the policy, arguing it ignores the clear and growing harms of climate change and replaces facts with feelings in guiding federal policy.</p>

          <p>Following talks in Kyiv between Ukraine's allies, Sir Keir Starmer described the meeting as a "significant moment" in efforts to secure a ceasefire in the conflict with Russia, though he acknowledged it is not the end of the process. Around 30 global leaders reaffirmed their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening "massive" sanctions if Russia does not comply. Sir Keir noted the unity among leaders in their demand and the potential response, which he said had been lacking previously during the conflict. The Kremlin responded by accusing European leaders of making "contradictory" remarks, but later stated that Russia would consider the proposal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency is creating conflicts of interest that are hindering the passage of crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, intended to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to concerns about Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures, such as the $TRUMP meme coin. Democrats argue that individuals can enrich the president by buying cryptocurrency he owns, creating a "pay-for-play scheme." The failure of the GENIUS bill could impact future legislative achievements and the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry, potentially stifling investment and innovation.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing criticism and the potential for President Trump's "Too Late" label due to the complex economic landscape. With tariffs threatening both growth and inflation, Powell is in a difficult position, and some economists believe his caution could lead to inaction until it's too late. Trump has been urging the Fed to cut rates, while economic data presents a mixed picture of price stability and heightened worries in various sectors. Powell has voiced confidence in the economy and labor market, dismissing the idea of pre-emptive rate cuts, however, history suggests the Fed is often slow to act, potentially missing crucial signals.</p>

          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, the daughter of actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was arrested during anti-war protests at Columbia University, which have also led to the temporary suspension of student journalists. The 18-year-old was given a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing after students occupied part of the main Butler library building in solidarity with Palestinian liberation. The students, renaming the space the Basel al-Araj Peopleâ€™s University, demanded that the university divest from funds and businesses involved in Israelâ€™s war. Columbia University and Barnard College temporarily suspended four student journalists who reported on the demonstrations, but later lifted the suspensions.</p>

While expectations for a significant breakthrough are low, the fact that the two countries are engaging in dialogue has raised hopes for de-escalation.

          <p>The new German government, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD, faces significant challenges, including an economic slump and the rise of the far-right AfD. The coalition aims to strengthen the economy, limit illegal migration, and restore order in Germany. The SPD is resisting drastic cuts, particularly in social policy. The government plans to prevent the AfD from gaining strength by addressing issues that have fueled its support, such as immigration. The new government also faces enormous challenges in foreign policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. The order calls for supplementing current efforts by deputizing state and local law enforcement officers and contracting with personnel from other federal agencies. The president's call to increase staff comes as his administration pursues multiple pathways to force undocumented immigrants to leave the US. Trump has called for individuals to self-deport and has used a government app known as CPB Home, also the DHS is offering bonuses and paid travel for people who leave the US voluntarily.</p>

A senior U.S. official said that President Trump had been in touch with European leaders throughout the week and signaled his support for the proposal for sanctions absent a ceasefire by Monday.

The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the ambitious Soviet Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. The spacecraft may have remained intact during its plunge.
