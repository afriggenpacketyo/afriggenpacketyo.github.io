          <p>A recent poll by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation reveals significant pessimism regarding Donald Trump's commitment to defending Taiwan from a potential Chinese invasion. The survey found that nearly 45% of respondents do not believe Trump is serious about deterring Beijing, reflecting a broader erosion of trust in the United States as a reliable partner. This sentiment has grown during Trump's second term, with a previous poll indicating over half of Taiwanese no longer view Washington as dependable, highlighting deep-seated concerns about the island's security and its alliance with the U.S.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced strong third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, prompting the company to raise its financial guidance for 2025. The automaker reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, citing a compelling vehicle portfolio and effective management of tariff impacts. Despite a significant drop in net income due to charges from its electric vehicle pullback, the updated outlook signals confidence in GM's performance for the remainder of the year. The positive results led to a notable increase in the company's stock price during pre-market trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola is set to release its third-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating earnings of 78 cents per share on $12.39 billion in revenue. The beverage company has faced challenges with weaker demand in key markets like the U.S. and Latin America, though investor sentiment remains more bullish compared to its rival, PepsiCo. The report comes as Coke is reportedly considering the sale of its Costa Coffee chain, which has not met growth expectations since its acquisition. The company's performance will be closely watched to see if it can maintain its projected full-year growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Cory Doctorow's Theory of 'Enshittification' Explains the Decline of Major Internet Platforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet activist Cory Doctorow's new book details the concept of "enshittification," a three-stage process describing how online platforms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google degrade over time. Initially, these platforms attract users with good services, then they pivot to benefit business customers, and finally, they exploit both groups to maximize profits for shareholders, leading to a decline in quality. Doctorow argues this devolution is driven by a lack of competition and regulation, trapping users and businesses in deteriorating ecosystems. He advocates for stronger antitrust enforcement and interoperability to reverse this trend and restore a healthier internet.</p>

          <p>Bernardo Bravo, the president of a citrus producers association in Michoacán, Mexico, was found killed in his vehicle after publicly speaking out against cartel extortion. Bravo had recently described how organized crime groups were crippling local businesses with impossible financial demands, leaving producers with no choice but to negotiate. This murder highlights the persistent and violent control that cartels exert over agricultural industries in the region, including limes and avocados. Despite federal troop deployments, criminal impunity remains a severe problem, with business leaders who resist often facing deadly consequences.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be incarcerated, starting a five-year sentence for conspiring to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The 70-year-old is being held in the isolation wing of Paris's La Santé prison for his own safety, though he maintains his innocence and has filed an appeal for his release. This landmark event has drawn significant public and political attention in France, with President Emmanuel Macron meeting with Sarkozy before his imprisonment and supporters gathering outside his home.</p>

          <p>A group of former tenants of Equity Residential, one of the largest corporate landlords in the U.S., is launching a novel debt strike to protest what they describe as predatory practices. Organized with the Debt Collective, the campaign aims to have tens of thousands of dollars in accumulated rental debt canceled, arguing that it creates insurmountable barriers to securing future housing. The strike utilizes a new online tool that helps tenants document landlord issues and generate formal dispute letters, a tactic inspired by successful student debt resistance campaigns.

          <p>Scientists report that the population of the endangered North Atlantic right whale has increased slightly to an estimated 384 individuals, marking the fourth year of slow but steady growth. This positive trend follows a significant 25% decline between 2010 and 2020, offering a glimmer of hope for one of the world's rarest marine mammals. Researchers attribute the recovery to conservation efforts, particularly new protective measures in Canada, and note encouraging signs in reproduction, such as new mothers and shorter calving intervals. However, threats from ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement remain a serious concern.</p>

          <p>The UK government borrowed £20.2 billion in September, the highest amount for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase was driven by rising debt interest payments, which overshadowed higher tax revenues, presenting a significant challenge for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget. The figures indicate that borrowing for the first half of the financial year is the second-highest on record. This financial pressure makes tax increases likely as the government aims to adhere to its self-imposed fiscal rules amidst a difficult economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article expresses skepticism about Instagram's latest teen safety feature, which automatically places users under 18 into a more restrictive "PG-13" content setting. The author argues that Meta's history of failed promises and ineffective safety tools suggests this new measure may be more public relations than a genuine solution to protecting minors from harmful content and online predators. Citing research showing existing tools are largely ineffective, the article calls for safety to be integrated into platform design from the start and urges parents to actively teach online safety, rather than trusting companies to self-regulate.</p>

While incarcerated at a low-medium security facility, Bannon taught a civics class, befriended inmates including convicted murderers, and used a coded email system to communicate with Trump's campaign. The experience solidified his belief that criminal justice reform could be a political tool for the MAGA movement. Since his release, Bannon has continued to advocate for a more radical, confrontational approach, influencing major decisions in Trump's second administration, such as the aggressive stance toward Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Amy Wallace, the co-writer of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, has called on Prince Andrew to share everything he witnessed regarding Jeffrey Epstein's abuse network. The book, "Nobody's Girl," details Giuffre's allegations against the prince, which he has consistently denied. Wallace argues that despite his denials, Andrew was present in Epstein's properties and on his jet and has a moral obligation to assist investigators, especially after acknowledging the suffering of Epstein's victims in his civil settlement. This comes as Andrew recently relinquished his royal titles amid ongoing public pressure and scrutiny.</p>

It explains the function of the ligaments, how tears occur (often without contact), and the consequences, including instability and pain. The piece details treatment options, from surgery using tendon grafts to conservative therapy focused on strengthening muscles. It also addresses the long-term risks like osteoarthritis and explains why female athletes face a higher risk due to anatomical, genetic, and hormonal factors.</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old man was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted police to his social media stream threatening to "shoot it up." Authorities took the suspect, identified as Billy Cagle, into custody unarmed inside the terminal. An AR-15 rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition was later found in his truck. Police Chief Darin Schierbaum stated that Cagle, a felon with known mental health challenges, was likely returning to his vehicle to retrieve the weapon when he was apprehended, and credited the family's quick action and inter-agency collaboration with averting a tragedy.</p>

A staunch conservative and ally of the late Shinzo Abe, the 64-year-old takes office at a time of economic difficulty, facing rising living costs and public frustration with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Her path to leadership was secured through a last-minute coalition deal after the LDP's longtime partner withdrew support. Takaichi now faces the challenge of rebuilding public trust, navigating tricky foreign relations with China and South Korea, and preparing for an upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

The military government accused the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic group, of involvement in the operation, a claim the group denies.

          <p>Following their 2024 election loss, some Democrats are reconsidering how they communicate about climate change, with a new poll suggesting the party's focus on the issue is seen as out of touch with voters' primary concerns like cost of living. The think tank Searchlight Institute advises against using the term "climate change," recommending instead a focus on how clean energy can lower costs. This reflects a broader trend of declining media coverage and public discussion of the topic. While some politicians are embracing this "cheap energy" framing, climate advocates worry that not talking about the issue directly will diminish its perceived importance.</p>
