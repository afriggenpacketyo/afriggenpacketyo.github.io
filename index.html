          <p>Chinese officials are rushing to adhere to President Xi Jinping's austerity measures, which have been in place since 2012, as inspectors conduct thorough checks on offices and spending habits. This campaign aims to improve the Communist Party's image, combat corruption, and reduce wasteful expenditures by focusing on areas such as official events, buildings, and travel protocols. Analysts suggest the campaign also ensures resources are wisely allocated to strengthen China's rivalry with the United States and identify politically loyal cadres for promotion. The campaign's effectiveness is questioned due to strict media control and the challenges of enforcing detailed rules on a large scale.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has cautioned Elon Musk about potential "serious consequences" if he funds Democratic candidates opposing Republicans who supported Trump's tax bill. This warning follows a public dispute between Trump and Musk, sparked by Musk's criticism of the tax bill, which he called "an abomination." Musk, previously a significant donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, may support Democratic opponents in primary elections as retribution for the bill's passage. Trump dismissed Musk's claims about his involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case as "old news" and stated he has no desire to reconcile with Musk, whom he deemed "disrespectful."</p>
