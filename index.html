          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. underwent a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing, facing sharp questions from both Democrats and Republicans regarding his controversial views on vaccines. The nearly three-hour session also addressed his recent staffing changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the ouster of its director. Senators pressed Kennedy on his unsubstantiated claims linking psychiatric drugs to school shootings and his accusations of corruption against major medical organizations, which he alleged have been compromised by the pharmaceutical industry. The hearing highlighted deep divisions over his leadership and public health policies.</p>

          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales increasing by 53.7% year-over-year, marking the model's best performance in 21 years. This growth contrasts with the broader industry rush towards electric vehicles, indicating strong continued consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly large family SUVs. While Ford's EV sales also grew, the success of the high-profit Expedition highlights the company's strategy of balancing EV development with its profitable lineup of trucks and SUVs. The trend suggests some consumers are still willing to invest in large, expensive gasoline vehicles despite rising interest in EVs.</p>

          <p>As Chicago grapples with crime, some city aldermen are calling for increased federal assistance, creating a division with Mayor Brandon Johnson, who opposes President Trump's suggestion of deploying the National Guard. Aldermen from both Democratic and independent affiliations have stated that federal help is needed, though some express concern that a military presence could be a 'recipe for disaster' and prefer financial aid to hire more local police. This debate occurs as Washington D.C. reports a sharp decrease in crime following a federal surge, a result praised by its previously critical mayor. Meanwhile, Mayor Johnson has signed an executive order to limit cooperation between local police and federal authorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement is unconstitutional and unlawful. The lawsuit, which names President Trump and heads of several federal departments, seeks a permanent injunction to halt the deployment. This legal action follows a recent federal court ruling that blocked a similar deployment in California.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has repeatedly declined to confirm whether he will dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner if an investigation finds she breached the ministerial code. Rayner admitted to underpaying stamp duty on a property and referred herself to the prime minister's independent standards adviser for a review. While Starmer assured he would act on the adviser's forthcoming report, he did not specify what that action would be, drawing criticism from political opponents who accuse him of hypocrisy. The situation has put Starmer's commitment to ministerial standards under scrutiny, as he previously called for the dismissal of officials in similar circumstances.</p>

His departure comes after the club recently secured its first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League.

The project, a joint venture between Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, is 80% complete and expected to power 350,000 homes.

Stewart argues that the conjure woman has been a central figure in American history, shaping practices around medicine, childbirth, and community protection.

Linda Stermer maintains her innocence, claiming she was fleeing to get help and accidentally hit him in the muddy driveway, unaware he was there. However, prosecutors and her own sons believe she intentionally set the fire and then ran him over, citing circumstantial evidence.

          <p>Texas is enacting a new law that empowers its residents to file civil lawsuits against any out-of-state manufacturer or distributor that supplies abortion pills to people within the state. The legislation entitles successful plaintiffs to a minimum of $100,000 in damages from the providers, although the women who take the medication are exempt from being sued. This law represents a novel legal strategy to extend the state's near-total abortion ban beyond its borders and intimidate providers in states where abortion remains legal.

The initial rollout will include dedicated beauty associates and shop-in-shop concepts, with plans to scale the business and extend it to other brands in the Gap portfolio next year.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests a Quarter of U.S. 'Farms' Are Not Commercially Productive</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis reveals that the widely cited figure of two million farms in the U.S. is misleading, as a significant portion of these entities produce little to no food and generate minimal income. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's broad definition of a 'farm' includes properties that sell as little as $1,000 in agricultural products, or even those with no sales that could theoretically produce that amount. This classification includes many hobby farms, residential properties with tax advantages, and land set aside for conservation. Critics argue this inflated number provides political cover for large, polluting agricultural corporations to resist environmental regulations by claiming they would burden millions of small farmers.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the iconic Italian fashion designer who built a global empire, has passed away at the age of 91. His company announced he died peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after having worked until his final days. Armani founded his eponymous luxury fashion house in Milan in 1975, revolutionizing menswear with his deconstructed jackets and defining an era of minimalist, elegant style that extended to Hollywood red carpets and film. He remained the CEO and sole shareholder of his company, leaving questions about succession, though he had indicated a preference for a gradual transition of responsibilities to his close team and family.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, the Irish co-creator of the sitcom "Father Ted," is on trial in London, accused of relentlessly harassing a transgender activist online and causing criminal damage to her phone. Prosecutors allege that Linehan, 57, used social media to publish a series of offensive and vindictive posts about the 18-year-old campaigner, calling her a 'domestic terrorist' and a 'sociopath.' The activist testified that the posts made her feel alarmed and distressed for her safety. Linehan has pleaded not guilty, claiming his posts were in the public interest as a journalist exposing the tactics of trans activists, and that a physical confrontation was a reflex response to being provoked.</p>

          <p>Nepal's government has instructed its telecommunications authority to block access to major social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, X, and LinkedIn, after they failed to register with local authorities by a given deadline. The move is part of a broader government crackdown aimed at curbing what it describes as the spread of hate, cybercrime, and social disharmony by users with fake IDs. Only a few platforms, most notably TikTok, complied with the registration directive, which required naming a local contact and grievance officer. Digital rights advocates have criticized the sudden shutdown as a controlling measure that infringes on the fundamental rights of the public.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has revealed that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. Newsom criticized the deployment as costly 'political theater,' providing a cost breakdown that included $71 million for basic necessities and $37 million for payroll since the troops arrived in June. The announcement comes after a federal judge blocked soldiers from participating in immigration arrests, a ruling seen as a victory for states opposing the administration's actions. While most of the 4,200 soldiers have been sent home, 300 remain, with their deployment extended until after the November election.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a powerful earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has risen to at least 2,205, with an additional 3,640 people reported injured. The quake struck late Sunday night, collapsing homes while residents were asleep, with the worst-hit villages located in remote, mountainous areas of Kunar and Nangarhar provinces. Rescue efforts are severely hampered by landslides blocking roads, forcing aid workers to travel on foot and some military commandos to be lowered by rope from helicopters. The disaster exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis in the country, with survivors burying the deceased in mass graves as aid is slow to arrive.</p>

          <p>The NBA is considering a significant change to its All-Star Game format for the 2026 event in Los Angeles, aiming to inject more competition and excitement into the showcase. The proposed format would feature a round-robin tournament with three eight-player teams: two composed of U.S.-born players and one team of international players. This move comes after years of criticism over the lack of defensive effort, which culminated in a 211-186 score in the 2024 game. The league and the players' union have presented the idea to the competition committee, hoping the USA vs. World concept will motivate players and re-engage fans.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that 26 Western allies have formally committed to deploying troops to Ukraine by land, sea, or air immediately following a ceasefire agreement with Russia. Speaking after a summit of the 'Coalition of the Willing,' Macron accused Russia of attempting to delay peace talks to seize more territory. This development marks a significant step in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, with U.S. support expected to be finalized soon, potentially in the form of air support. The pledge comes amid ongoing violence and stalled diplomatic efforts to end the war, which has been ongoing for over three and a half years.</p>
