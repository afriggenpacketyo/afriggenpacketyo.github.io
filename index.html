          <p>Peter Coker Sr. and Peter Coker Jr. were sentenced in a New Jersey federal court for their roles in a $100 million securities fraud scheme involving a small deli and a shell company. Coker Jr. received a 40-month prison sentence, while his father was sentenced to six months in jail followed by six months of home confinement. Coker Jr.'s lawyer cited his client's time in a Thai prison and severe cirrhosis as mitigating factors, while Coker Jr. expressed remorse for his actions. The fraudulent scheme involved inflating the share price of two companies to position them for mergers, with one company owning a small, money-losing deli. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, which would be the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, according to estimates from policy analysts and senior groups. The COLA is an annual inflation adjustment to Social Security benefits, calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year. The CPI-W, which is used to calculate Social Security's COLA, increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months.

          <h2>Tariffs Implemented, Inflation Slows: Economic Impacts Remain Uncertain</h2>

          <p>Despite President Trump's implementation of broad tariffs on goods from every country, inflation slowed in April, with the Consumer Price Index rising at a 2.3 percent annual rate. The Trump administration also lowered its tariffs on China, bringing its levy on Chinese imports down from 145 percent to 30 percent for 90 days. While the risk of a severe economic crisis has fallen, tariffs are still poised to raise prices and slow growth later this year. The risk of a US recession has fallen, with Wall Street forecasters projecting a recession by year’s end.</p>

          <p>The PGA of America has reiterated its opposition to the proposed rollback of the golf ball, stating it is "vehemently against" the plans put forward by the sport’s rule-makers. The R&A and USGA announced in late 2023 that all professionals will be required to use a modified golf ball from 2028, with changes applying to amateurs from 2030. The PGA Tour has never supported the rollback plan, and equipment manufacturers have also expressed firm opposition. The PGA of America is asking for a delay in the rollback so research numbers can be reassessed.</p>

          <p>The California attorney general’s office will seek a preliminary injunction in its case challenging President Trump’s tariff policy, a move that could result in a court order freezing sweeping import duties on worldwide products. The case argues that Trump lacks authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs. A hearing in the case is scheduled for next week, and a decision on the preliminary injunction could come from the San Francisco federal court as soon as mid-June.
