          <p>Senior officials from the U.S. and China met in New York, agreeing to increase dialogue to manage their significant differences. The Chinese vice-foreign minister reiterated Beijing's stance on Taiwan as an internal affair, while the U.S. deputy secretary of state pushed for action on the fentanyl crisis and the repatriation of undocumented Chinese nationals. Both sides described the conversation as "candid, in-depth and constructive," signaling a mutual desire to maintain open channels and expand cooperation where possible. The meeting is seen as a preparatory step ahead of a potential summit between Presidents Trump and Xi.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities worldwide are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, a phenomenon experts are calling "ratmageddon." Researchers link the surge to warmer winters caused by climate change, which allows rats to breed more successfully year-round, alongside factors like increased fast-food waste and urban expansion. Pest control companies report a dramatic rise in callouts, while studies show rat activity has spiked in major cities like New York and London. Experts argue that simply using poison is ineffective and that the ultimate solution lies in better urban sanitation and waste management to cut off the rodents' food sources.</p>

          <p>A large-scale search is in progress for Bryson Higashi, a 44-year-old diver who went missing in the waters near Hanalei Bay, Kauai. Higashi was last seen on Tuesday afternoon, and a multi-agency effort was launched after his truck was found unattended for a full day. The U.S. Coast Guard, along with local police, fire, and natural resources departments, are involved in the search, utilizing boats, a helicopter, and an airplane. Search conditions are challenging, with strong winds, high seas, and reduced visibility due to showers, as authorities urge anyone with information to come forward immediately.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, analysis focuses on whether Team Europe can overcome the home-field advantage that has dominated recent contests. Key factors expected to decide the outcome include the performance in the opening foursomes, where home teams have historically built commanding leads. Europe's strategy will likely involve quieting the notoriously boisterous New York crowd early to prevent the atmosphere from becoming a "bear pit." The European team holds a significant advantage in player experience, though the American side features the world's top-ranked player, Scottie Scheffler. The event promises a highly competitive and electric environment.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly involved in high-level discussions about leading a transitional authority in Gaza should a ceasefire be implemented. The proposal, discussed by U.S. President Trump and Arab leaders, envisions an interim body with UN and Gulf state backing to govern the territory before it is returned to Palestinian control. Sir Tony, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, has participated in White House meetings on post-war plans for the region.

          <p>Rangers Football Club and manager Russell Martin are under intense scrutiny following a 1-0 Europa League loss to Genk, marking their fourth defeat in seven games. Pundits and former players have described the team's performances as predictable and lacking in belief, with club legend Ally McCoist stating the manager is "in big trouble." Martin's post-match comments, in which he claimed the team was aggressive and in control, were met with perplexity by analysts who saw little creativity on the field. The loss has amplified fan frustration, with many questioning Martin's leadership and the team's direction.</p>

          <p>An opinion article contrasts China's methodical, long-term economic planning with what it describes as the United States' reactive and politically polarized approach. China's five-year plans, managed by its National Development and Reform Commission, set proactive goals for growth and reform, with work on the next plan beginning as soon as one is approved. In contrast, the U.S. system, which relies on monetary and fiscal policy guided by executive and congressional action, has become dysfunctional due to intense political division. This fundamental difference in governance philosophy allows China to strategically plan for its future while America often reacts to immediate crises.</p>

          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly January wildfires has identified significant weaknesses, including resource shortages and outdated alert systems, that led to delayed evacuation warnings. The report, commissioned after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed over 30 people, points to "outdated policies, inconsistent practices and communications vulnerabilities." Critical staffing shortages in the sheriff's department and emergency management office, coupled with unreliable communication platforms, hampered the efforts of first responders. While praising heroic individual actions, the report concludes that systemic improvements are urgently needed for future disasters.</p>

In a pointed remark, Starmer compared Burnham's economic ideas to those of former Conservative PM Liz Truss, whose tenure was marked by economic chaos.

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 100% tariff on imported branded and patented pharmaceuticals has sent shockwaves through the industry, with companies and experts warning of severe consequences. The policy, intended to force manufacturers to build plants in the U.S., is being criticized for potentially disrupting global supply chains, exacerbating drug shortages, and driving up healthcare costs for patients. Major drugmakers argue the tariffs will divert capital needed for innovation and investment in reshoring operations. While some firms with existing U.S. manufacturing may be better positioned, the move creates significant uncertainty for the pharmaceutical sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Humberto, has formed in the central Atlantic and is expected to strengthen significantly. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Humberto will become a hurricane on Friday and potentially a major hurricane over the weekend as it moves northwest. Currently, the storm poses no immediate threat to land, and no coastal watches or warnings are in effect. Forecasters are also monitoring a second weather system in the northeast Caribbean that has the potential to develop into a tropical depression and bring heavy rain to Puerto Rico.</p>

          <h2>Parents of Girl Still Missing in Camp Flood Criticize Reopening Plans as 'Unthinkable'</h2>

          <p>The parents of an 8-year-old girl still missing after a deadly flood at Camp Mystic in Texas have condemned the camp's decision to reopen next year as "unthinkable." The summer camp announced it would reopen a sister site in 2026, less than three months after a flash flood on the Guadalupe River killed 27 campers and counselors. In a letter, the parents of Cile Steward criticized the move as resuming "business as usual" while their daughter's body has yet to be recovered from the same river where new campers would swim. Other victims' families have joined the criticism.</p>

          <p>According to Raj Ganguly, co-founder of venture capital firm B Capital, the world is in the early stages of an artificial intelligence "super cycle" that could last for two decades. He argues that AI will profoundly change every industry, from drug development to the job market, representing one of the biggest technological shifts in recent history. While acknowledging that parts of the market are currently "frothy" and overvalued due to excessive hype, Ganguly believes the long-term impact will be transformative. He also noted that the next decade of innovation will be driven by "deep tech" like AI and advanced semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to open the world's highest bridge to traffic this Sunday in the southwestern province of Guizhou. The new bridge, which crosses the incredibly deep Huajiang Grand Canyon, has a deck that stands 625 meters (2,050 feet) above the river below, equivalent to the height of China's tallest skyscraper. This engineering marvel surpasses the previous record-holder by approximately 60 meters and will also be the world's longest mountain bridge. The structure is the latest addition to a region that is already home to nearly half of the 100 tallest bridges on the planet.</p>

          <p>A former Orange County sheriff's deputy, Arcadio Rodriguez, will not serve jail time after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges for sexually assaulting two female inmates while they were incarcerated. Rodriguez was sentenced to time already served under home confinement but must register as a sex offender for at least a decade. The District Attorney's office noted that state law prevented felony charges because the assault was over clothing, not skin-to-skin, and is now seeking changes to the law. The case highlights a legal loophole that critics argue fails to adequately punish officials who abuse their power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of James Comey is the culmination of a long and public campaign by Donald Trump against the former FBI director he fired in 2017. Their fraught relationship began when Comey refused to pledge personal loyalty to the president and publicly confirmed the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Ironically, Comey's actions during that same election—particularly his public statements about the Hillary Clinton email investigation just days before the vote—are widely seen as having damaged her campaign and helped Trump win. The prosecution is viewed by many as a politically motivated effort to punish a key figure from the Russia probe.</p>

          <p>After a satirical 12-foot statue depicting President Trump holding hands with Jeffrey Epstein was installed and quickly removed from the National Mall, the National Park Service has denied a permit for its reinstallation. The anonymous activist group behind the statue claims the initial removal was improper, as they were not given the required 24-hour notice to correct an alleged permit discrepancy. The group's attempt to secure a new permit was denied without explanation, leading to accusations that the decision came from "a very high place." The incident has become a flashpoint in the ongoing debate over free speech and political art.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a stark warning about a more than 460% increase in infections from a "superbug" bacteria between 2019 and 2023. The bacteria, known as NDM-CRE, is resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics available, making infections extremely difficult to treat and increasing the risk of death. Public health officials associate the surge with the widespread use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts are concerned because the bacteria can cause severe illnesses like pneumonia and bloodstream infections, and treatment options are severely limited. They advise judicious antibiotic use and good hygiene.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Todd West was executed in Alabama using nitrogen gas for the 1997 murder of a convenience store clerk, Margaret Parrish Berry. The execution proceeded despite a public plea for clemency from the victim's son, Will Berry, who stated that he and his father had forgiven West and did not want him to die. In a final statement, West acknowledged this forgiveness and expressed remorse. The execution method, which Alabama has recently started using, involves forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen. The case has drawn attention to the complexities of capital punishment, mercy, and the wishes of victims' families.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a presidential memorandum aimed at dismantling what he calls organized political violence and domestic terrorism, a move critics fear is a pretext for a broad crackdown on his political opponents. The memo directs an "all-of-government" effort, using FBI joint terrorism taskforces, to investigate the funding and organization behind groups the administration labels as left-wing. When questioned, Trump suggested that prominent liberal donors could be targets. Civil liberties groups immediately condemned the action as a "shameful and dangerous move" that falsely applies the label of terrorism to non-profits, activists, and those engaged in dissent.</p>
