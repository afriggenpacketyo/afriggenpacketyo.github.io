          <h2>Durable Goods Orders Surge in March Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orders for durable goods in March saw a significant increase, jumping 9.2%, as companies rushed to place orders ahead of expected tariffs imposed by President Trump. The surge was particularly notable in transportation equipment, driven by a 139% increase in nondefense aircraft and parts. However, the report also highlighted apprehension about broader economic conditions due to the tariffs, suggesting the surge may not be indicative of long-term trends. The labor market remained stable, with jobless claims showing no significant increase despite federal employment cuts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The German government has revised its economic growth forecast to zero for 2025, attributing the stagnation to the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. Outgoing Economy Minister Robert Habeck stated that the U.S.'s tariff policies directly affect Germany's export-oriented economy. This marks the third consecutive year without growth for Germany, following recessions in 2023 and 2024, highlighting the significant economic challenges faced by Europe's largest economy due to international trade tensions.</p>

A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson emphasized that the U.S. should cancel all unilateral measures against China if it genuinely seeks to resolve trade issues. These comments align with the official stance that China is willing to engage in talks only if treated as an equal, highlighting continued friction in the trade relationship between the two nations. The U.S. has recently imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man was deported to El Salvador after mistakenly crossing into Canada via the Ambassador Bridge while delivering food in Detroit.

          <p>Existing home sales in March fell 5.9% from February, reaching their slowest pace since 2009, primarily due to high mortgage rates and economic concerns. Despite a nearly 20% increase in available listings, sales remain sluggish, with the median home price rising to $403,700, a 2.7% increase from last year. Economists note rising cancelled contracts and potential for further market decline due to stock market volatility and consumer anxiety about inflation and jobs.

          <p>Researchers warn that holding paper receipts for as little as 10 seconds can pose health risks due to the absorption of Bisphenol S (BPS), an endocrine disruptor. The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) issued a notice of violation to 32 retailers allegedly using high levels of BPS in their receipts. BPS mimics estrogen and can disrupt bodily functions, including metabolism and reproduction, with even short-term exposure potentially having serious health consequences.

          <p>China is finding it challenging to respond to the unpredictable foreign policy of the Trump administration, particularly regarding conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

The potential for lucrative reconstruction contracts in these conflict zones could incentivize China's involvement once ceasefires are established.</p>

          <p>The wife and 5-year-old child of Ecuadorian soccer player Jackson Rodríguez were kidnapped after men broke into their home in Guayaquil. Rodríguez hid under a bed during the incident, which occurred amid a state of emergency declared in several areas of the country due to organized crime. Ecuador has been grappling with increasing insecurity and crime, with a rise in violent deaths reported in the first few months of the year. The U.S. has been targeting gangs in Ecuador, and the president has suggested deploying U.S. special forces to combat drug violence.</p>

The company's U.S. games business, which benefits from digital and domestic sourcing, is less exposed to the tariffs.</p>
