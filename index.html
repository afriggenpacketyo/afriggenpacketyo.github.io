        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scottish First Minister John Swinney has announced he will not support the assisted dying bill proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, which is scheduled for a vote on May 13. The bill would allow terminally ill individuals, deemed mentally fit by two doctors, to request medical assistance to end their lives. Swinney's opposition could influence undecided MSPs, particularly within his own party, as the Scottish Parliament prepares for its third vote on this issue, having previously rejected similar bills in 2010 and 2014. McArthur has adjusted the proposed legislation, raising the minimum age from 16 to 18, aligning it with laws in other countries, and urging MSPs to vote in favor of creating a compassionate and safe law for Scotland.</p>

          <p>International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach indicated that Japan is welcome to bid for future Summer or Winter Games, but only after addressing corruption issues surrounding past events. Sapporo withdrew its bid for the 2030 Winter Games following scandals linked to the 2020 Tokyo Games. Bach emphasized the need for Japan to ensure such corruption is addressed and that Japanese business practices are clarified. Despite these issues, Bach acknowledged Japan's significant role in the Olympic movement, highlighting its success in hosting international tournaments and the achievements of its athletes at the Paris Games.</p>

          <p>In a meeting in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping presented their countries as guardians of stability and historical memory, ahead of celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. The two leaders criticized what they termed "unilateralism and bullying by powerful countries," a clear reference to the United States. With Russia's increasing dependence on Beijing following its isolation from the West due to the war in Ukraine, Xi described relations between China and Russia as "more calm, confident, stable and resilient." Putin also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of reviving Nazism, falsely.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will give away virtually all of his wealth, estimated at $108 billion, over the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation, inspired by Andrew Carnegie's essay "The Gospel of Wealth." The Gates Foundation, originally planned to operate decades after his and Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045. Gates aims to focus on stopping preventable deaths of mothers and children, eradicating infectious diseases, and improving education, but is concerned about potential setbacks due to cuts in U.S. foreign aid. He expressed his determination to ensure the money is well spent during this final chapter of his career.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that deporting migrants to Libya without due process would violate a previous court order, following reports that the White House considered such plans. Lawyers for the migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing safety concerns and allegations that migrants were being prepared for removal on military aircraft. The judge clarified that any imminent removals to countries like Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month, which barred deportations to countries other than the migrants' place of origin without due process. The article notes that Libya is considered unsafe due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict.</p>

          <p>The European Union is contemplating imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports in an effort to persuade the Trump administration to retract its existing and proposed tariffs against the EU. The potential tariff targets include Boeing aircraft, chemicals, electrical equipment, health-related products, and certain food items. Brussels has also initiated consultations with member states regarding potential litigation against the US over the blanket 20% reciprocal tariffs announced by President Trump. These proposals are in addition to a list of â‚¬21 billion retaliatory tariffs previously announced and then paused by the EU, which included taxes on Harley-Davidsons, poultry, and clothing.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to plunge back to Earth. Experts predict the spacecraft, which failed its mission to Venus due to a rocket malfunction, will reenter the atmosphere uncontrolled. The spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, posing a small risk to humans. While most of the spacecraft is expected to burn up during reentry, there is a possibility that the landing capsule, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, could survive, resulting in a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.</p>

          <p>Following the death of international relations scholar Joseph Nye, known for coining the term "soft power," Chinese scholars have expressed cautious views on his intellectual legacy. While Nye's concept of soft power was widely praised in China during his lifetime, scholars now suggest his policy influence was limited and his attitude toward China was not as friendly as some believed. China has embraced Nye's concept of soft power and attempted to apply it in its foreign policy, with several Chinese leaders emphasizing its importance.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report indicates that a sightseeing helicopter in New York City broke apart in midair before crashing into the river, killing five passengers and the pilot. Witnesses reported hearing loud "bangs" before the helicopter separated into three major sections. Aviation experts suggest the tail boom may have been struck by the aircraft's main rotor blades. The report does not determine the initial cause of the breakup, which is expected to be revealed through a forensic examination of the wreckage.

The UK, which runs a trade deficit with the U.S., was spared the higher "reciprocal" tariffs but still faces the baseline 10% levy.

          <p>The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%, marking the fourth reduction in the past year, citing a slowdown in inflation as the primary reason. Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned about the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs, despite the anticipation of a UK-US trade deal. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4%, but decided against it due to concerns about the global trade war impacting economic growth.

          <p>Bill Gates has committed to donating 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than initially planned. This pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever, allowing the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. Gates cites the ability to maximize impact now as the reason for accelerating the timeline, focusing on global health and education. The announcement signals sustained support for these causes and an eventual end to the foundation's global influence.</p>
