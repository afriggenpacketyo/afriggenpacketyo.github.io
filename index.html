        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dutch government, led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof, has collapsed after Geert Wilders withdrew his far-right PVV party from the ruling coalition due to disagreements over immigration proposals. Wilders expressed that his party could not support the alliance's lack of support for their asylum proposal, which included stricter policies. The collapse has led to shock and anger among political leaders, with accusations that Wilders engineered the crisis for political gain, as the government barely made any concrete plans during its 11 months in office. The ministers will remain in power in a caretaker capacity until a date is set for the Netherlands to return to the polls.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after her disappearance in 2007. The search, focusing on an area near Praia da Luz, involves clearing vegetation and examining disused buildings, with around 30 German officers participating. The investigation is led by German investigators, who have identified Christian Brückner as their prime suspect, currently serving a sentence for a separate sexual assault case. British police continue to treat the case as a missing persons investigation, and any evidence seized will be handed over to German authorities, as the search is expected to continue until Friday.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is entering hurricane season with significant staffing shortages, raising concerns about the agency's ability to forecast and prepare the public for weather-related disasters. Staff cuts, stemming from the Trump administration's initiative to reduce government spending, have resulted in the loss of approximately 550 employees from the Weather Service. While NOAA plans to fill 126 critical vacancies, former agency leaders warn of potentially catastrophic consequences if resources are not replenished, as understaffed local forecast offices may struggle to provide timely and accurate warnings. The agency has updated service level standards to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has sparked anger in Wales, as it is classified as an 'England and Wales' project despite having no tracks laid in Wales. This classification means Wales will not receive additional funding through the Barnett Formula, leading to accusations of being denied hundreds of millions in funding. Welsh politicians argue that the decision is unfair and would deny Wales millions in funding that could transform their own rail network. The UK government maintains that the project will be financed through its rail network enhancements pipeline, which also funds schemes in Wales.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's preferred breakfast is bacon and eggs, a classic American choice also favored by other presidents. He specifies "bacon medium and the eggs over-well," as he told People Magazine in 2015. Trump also enjoys cereal, particularly cornflake-type cereals and Raisin Bran made in the USA, especially from Iowa. When skipping breakfast, Trump often opts for Diet Coke, reportedly consuming up to a dozen cans daily, with fast food being another occasional preference due to his belief in its consistent preparation.</p>

The automaker's "From America, For America" employee pricing program has contributed to strong sales results, coinciding with President Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles.</p>

Borrowers should monitor FOMC meetings and be aware of both the benefits and risks associated with HELOCs, including the potential for variable rates and foreclosure.
