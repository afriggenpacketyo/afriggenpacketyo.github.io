          <p>As the conflict between Iran and Israel escalates, Afghan refugees in Iran are facing renewed danger and uncertainty, exacerbating already dire conditions in Afghanistan. The fighting has caused prices for Iranian-imported goods to surge in Afghanistan, further straining its economy. Millions of Afghan refugees in Iran, who initially sought safety, now face harassment, restricted movement, and rising prices. Returning to Afghanistan is not a viable option for many due to fear of persecution under the Taliban regime, leaving them trapped and vulnerable. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick made landfall in Oaxaca, Mexico, as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, threatening destructive winds, flash floods, and storm surge.

Erick is expected to weaken rapidly as it moves inland, though heavy rains are still expected across several Mexican states. Acapulco residents, still bearing the memory of Hurricane Otis, braced for the storm's arrival, with authorities urging people to stay home or seek shelter.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Yeztugo, the first twice-yearly injectable medication to prevent HIV, developed by Gilead Sciences. This HIV-1 capsid inhibitor reduces the risk of sexually acquired HIV in adults and adolescents, demonstrating nearly 100% effectiveness in clinical trials. The drug, administered as a subcutaneous injection, offers a more convenient alternative to daily oral medications. Common side effects reported during trials include injection site reactions, headache, and nausea, but the medication is considered a significant breakthrough in the fight against HIV.</p>

          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive £150 off their energy bills this winter as the government expands eligibility for the Warm Home Discount. The changes scrap property size and energy score requirements, allowing 2.7 million additional homes, including those with children, to benefit. Energy companies will fund the discount, potentially leading to slight increases in customer bills, although the government anticipates savings from expenditure cuts will offset these rises. While debt charities welcome the move, some argue that the scheme still excludes vulnerable individuals on non-means tested benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite these challenges, American real estate has remained resilient, and U.S. equities could potentially end the year with a slight increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vicky Curtis-Cresswell, the winner of a £6 million Omaze house in Norfolk, is still waiting to receive her keys due to a planning dispute. An anonymous complaint has triggered an investigation by North Norfolk District Council, alleging that the house was not built according to approved designs. Omaze has submitted a pre-application and is preparing a retrospective planning application to resolve the issue. While the dispute is ongoing, Ms. Curtis-Cresswell cannot access her prize, and there is a possibility that the plans could be rejected.</p>

          <p>India's aviation regulator has issued a warning to Air India for violating safety regulations after three of its Airbus planes flew with overdue checks on emergency equipment. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) found that mandatory inspections on escape slides were delayed, with one Airbus A320 jet flying international routes for over a month without inspection. Air India acknowledged the issue and stated it is accelerating verification of maintenance records. The DGCA report stated that certificates of airworthiness for aircraft missing mandatory checks are "deemed suspended".</p>

          <p>Yoshua Bengio, known as the "godfather of AI," has launched a new organization called LawZero to ensure AI does not harm humanity. He proposes developing "Scientist AI," a non-autonomous AI designed to predict whether another AI's action would cause harm and block it if it is too risky. Bengio's plan stems from his disillusionment with current AI systems and his concern about the potential for AI agents to escape human control. He believes that governments and companies should prioritize AI safety and ethical considerations.</p>

          <p>Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, targeted by an Israeli airstrike, has been a focal point of international concern due to its potential for producing plutonium, which can be used in nuclear weapons. Though never online, the reactor was part of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, under which Iran agreed to redesign the facility to alleviate proliferation concerns. Following the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in 2018, the Arak reactor became a point of contention. The U.N. nuclear watchdog confirmed that since it was not in operation and contained no nuclear material, there was no danger to the public after the strike.</p>

His detention highlights increasing ICE activity in Oregon's wine country and raises concerns about the treatment of immigrant workers.

          <p>The US is bracing for another hot and dry wildfire season, but federal fire crews are concerned that cuts to budgets and staff have left them underprepared. The administration’s crackdown on climate science and the dismantling of departments that provided world-class research and weather forecasting, may also undermine early warning systems, slowing response and strategic planning. There are also fears that Trump’s new wildfire directive to bring the country’s federal firefighters together under a new agency will be rushed. Experts and firefighters express concerns about the loss of support staff, reduced workforce, and a return to a “full-suppression” ethos.</p>
