          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of ten beverages inspired by its short-lived CosMc's drink concept, aiming to attract Gen Z customers with bold flavors. The drinks, including cold brews and fruit refreshers, will be introduced at 500 locations, starting in Wisconsin and Colorado. This initiative represents a strategic shift to integrate successful beverage ideas directly into McDonald's restaurants following the closure of the standalone CosMc's chain. The move is part of a broader effort to boost sales and appeal to evolving consumer tastes.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" about Republicans expanding their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections, citing historical trends that typically favor the party not holding the presidency. He pointed to the number of Democratic-held districts that President Trump won in 2024 and demographic shifts as key opportunities for the GOP. Johnson also predicted that the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which extends tax cuts and adds work requirements for benefits, would serve as "jet fuel" for the economy, eventually winning over voters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for local governments to remove homeless individuals from public spaces and place them into treatment facilities. The order seeks to reverse legal precedents that restrict such actions and redirects federal funds toward rehabilitation and mental health services to "restore public order." This policy arrives as homelessness has reached record highs, driven by a housing shortage. The move was condemned by the National Homelessness Law Center, which argued it criminalizes homelessness and will ultimately worsen the crisis.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn Alina Habba's nomination to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a procedural maneuver that allows her to serve in the position in an acting capacity. This move bypasses a federal court's decision to replace her and circumvents the need for Senate confirmation, which was blocked by New Jersey's Democratic senators. The situation has created a complex legal and political showdown between the Department of Justice, which supports Habba, and federal judges in the state who had appointed her deputy to the role instead.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated that the complainant's testimony was not found to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The high-profile case centered on whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, consented to subsequent sexual acts with the other four men who entered the room. The players' lawyers maintained their clients believed she had consented throughout the encounter.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a critical component for developing ultra-high-power laser weapons. This synthetic crystal, measuring 60mm in diameter, can efficiently convert laser beams for long-distance transmission and can withstand immense power levels, far exceeding existing military-grade materials. The breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based laser systems capable of disabling satellites, overcoming previous technical hurdles related to self-damage that have limited the power and range of such weapons.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster demonstrated a notable transformation at the Big Ten media day, delivering a poised and confident address that contrasted sharply with his widely mocked, unrehearsed performance a year ago. Foster used humor to acknowledge his past stumbles while expressing strong optimism for the program's future, citing an overhauled staff and the high-profile transfer of quarterback Nico Iamaleava. His turnaround onstage mirrors the momentum his team built in the latter half of last season.</p>

          <p>USC head football coach Lincoln Riley stated emphatically at Big Ten media day that he wants to continue the university's historic rivalry game against Notre Dame. Riley explained that while he is a strong proponent of the matchup, the primary obstacle to scheduling future games is the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the College Football Playoff format. He argued that a playoff model with automatic qualifiers for conferences would help preserve important nonconference rivalries by reducing their impact on playoff selection.</p>

Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately disputed. While Trump reiterated his desire for lower interest rates, he also appeared to back away from recent threats to fire Powell, stating such a move was not necessary. The visit highlights the intense pressure the administration is placing on the traditionally independent institution.</p>

The plan would allow water agencies to comply with regulations through negotiated "voluntary agreements" involving habitat restoration, rather than strict river flow limits. While proponents call it a collaborative solution, environmental and fishing groups argue it will devastate the estuary's fragile ecosystem by failing to mandate adequate freshwater flows.</p>

This foregone profit comes as the company's core auto business is facing declining revenue and increased competition. (not investment advice)</p>
