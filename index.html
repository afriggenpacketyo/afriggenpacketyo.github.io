          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why 15 Million Vacant Homes Don't Solve the U.S. Housing Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the paradox of nearly 15 million vacant homes coexisting with a severe U.S. housing crisis. It clarifies that many vacancies are part of the normal rental market turnover, seasonal properties, or are located in areas with low demand, making them unsuitable for addressing shortages in high-cost cities. While initiatives in cities like Detroit and Baltimore to reclaim abandoned properties are vital for urban renewal, they are not a universal solution. The piece concludes that a multifaceted approach, including combating property speculation and constructing new housing, is necessary to resolve the affordability crisis.</p>

The market is also processing reports of potential U.S.-led tariffs on China and India over Russian oil purchases.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes the recent performance struggles of Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli, who has faced criticism for his lack of attacking output. It explores potential reasons for his downturn, including a lack of confidence and changes in the team's tactical style under manager Mikel Arteta, which may not suit his preference for running into open space. While Arteta continues to show trust in Martinelli, his form is under the microscope, especially following a significant summer transfer spending spree by the club. The piece speculates on whether a shift to a more direct, transitional style this season could help the Brazilian winger rediscover his goal-scoring prowess.</p>

          <p>Poland reported an "unprecedented" act of aggression after at least 19 Russian drones violated its airspace overnight, prompting the scrambling of Polish and allied fighter jets which shot down several of the unmanned aircraft. Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed the downings and stated Warsaw had requested consultations under NATO's Article 4, which allows allies to convene over a security threat. The incursion, which occurred during a large-scale Russian attack on Ukraine, was condemned by European leaders as a reckless escalation. While no casualties were reported in Poland, the incident marks a significant and dangerous new phase in the regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Nepal's army is patrolling the streets of Kathmandu after anti-corruption protests, initially led by "Gen Z" activists, escalated into widespread violence, resulting in 29 deaths and the prime minister's resignation. Government buildings and parliament were set ablaze, prompting a nationwide curfew. The original youth organizers claim their peaceful movement was "hijacked" by opportunistic elements and are now participating in cleanup efforts.

          <p>In an interview about his new book, "Science Under Siege," vaccine scientist Dr. Peter Hotez details his personal and professional battle against the growing anti-science movement. He explains his refusal to debate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing Kennedy's disinterest in scientific facts, and describes the movement as a lethal, globalizing force that threatens responses to pandemics and climate change. Hotez also recounts facing personal attacks, including antisemitic threats, for his work on a low-cost COVID-19 vaccine. He expresses deep concern that such hostility will deter the next generation of scientists from entering critical public health fields.</p>

          <p>French authorities have reported that three people, possibly including children, died while attempting to cross the English Channel from France to the UK. The victims were on a boat with 38 people and were likely crushed in the overcrowded vessel. This tragic event adds to the more than 20 lives lost in the Channel this year, highlighting the ongoing danger of these crossings. The incident occurred as the UK's new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, reiterated her commitment to stopping the "vile people smugglers" and restoring order to the immigration system, with over 30,000 people having made the journey in small boats in 2025.</p>

          <p>A Guardian investigation based on leaked flight records reveals the Trump administration is using an extensive network of charter flights to shuttle thousands of immigrants between detention centers across the U.S. The data from Global Crossing Airlines shows frequent, multi-leg journeys that effectively isolate detainees from their families and legal counsel, potentially violating their due process rights. The report details how this system creates a state of "purgatory" for immigrants, who are often kept unaware of their destination. This increased movement is seen by advocates as a cruel tactic designed to pressure individuals into accepting voluntary deportation.</p>

          <p>A 30-day period during which President Trump federalized Washington D.C.'s police and deployed the National Guard has resulted in a climate of fear, particularly within immigrant communities. While the administration claimed the move was to fight violent crime, reports indicate a surge in arrests for low-level offenses and widespread racial profiling of Black and brown residents. Federal agents have employed tactics like stop-and-frisks and checkpoints, which the local police department typically avoids. The takeover has been deeply unpopular with residents, who describe it as an occupation that has undermined safety rather than enhanced it.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans face a sharp increase in health insurance costs as the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which have lowered premiums for marketplace plans, are set to expire after 2025. According to policy experts, this "subsidy cliff" could cause average premiums to rise by about 75% for approximately 22 million people if Congress does not act to extend them. The potential expiration threatens to reverse recent gains in health coverage, which saw the U.S. uninsured rate fall to a historic low. Lawmakers are currently debating an extension, with the outcome holding significant financial implications for households relying on ACA plans. (not investment advice)</p>

Team Abnormal views a shutdown not as a policy fight, but as a necessary act of sabotage to stall anti-democratic moves.

          <h2>Universities of Kent and Greenwich to Merge, Creating UK's First Regional 'Super-University'</h2>

          <p>The universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge, forming the United Kingdom's first large-scale "super-university" under the proposed name of London and South East University Group. The single institution, which will have nearly 50,000 students, is expected to be operational by the 2026 academic year. While university leaders frame the move as an innovative way to create a financially resilient institution, the University and College Union warns of "almost certain" redundancies, suggesting it is effectively a takeover of the financially struggling University of Kent. The merger is being watched closely as a potential model for other UK universities facing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Transportation Safety Board provides frightening details about a Delta flight in July that encountered severe turbulence, injuring multiple passengers and crew members. The Amsterdam-bound flight flew into a thunderstorm over Wyoming, subjecting unbuckled occupants to gravitational forces up to 1.75 times their body weight and throwing them into the ceiling. The seat belt sign was off at the time, and the turbulence lasted for 2.5 minutes. The flight diverted to Minneapolis, where 18 people were hospitalized, highlighting the dangers of unexpected severe weather and the importance of remaining seated with a seatbelt fastened.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump dined at a seafood restaurant in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, an outing he used to promote his federal crackdown on crime in the city. While he was met with some cheers outside, a group of protesters inside the restaurant chanted against his policies, holding Palestinian flags before being removed by the Secret Service. Trump claimed his actions have made the city safe and that restaurants are now "booming," a statement that contrasts with reports of business disruptions and resident complaints about the heavy police and military presence. He also hinted at deploying federal forces to another city soon, continuing his strategy of federal intervention in largely Democratic urban areas.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, delivering a significant ruling in a legal clash over the central bank's independence. Trump had attempted to remove Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud that predated her appointment, but the judge ruled that the "for cause" provision for removing a governor applies only to their conduct while in office. The White House has vowed to continue its efforts to remove her. This case is seen as a crucial test of a president's power to exert political influence over the Federal Reserve's board.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States' global leadership in innovation is under threat due to cuts in research funding, political interference in science, and diminished support for education. The authors contend that the historical success of the U.S. innovation ecosystem was built on public-private partnerships, with federal investment in basic research being a critical foundation. With competitors like China increasing their investment, the article calls for policymakers to restore research funding, support small businesses, and defend free inquiry at universities. It warns that without decisive action, the U.S. risks losing the competitive edge that has long driven its economic dynamism.</p>

          <p>A review of the "The Kingdom of Pylos" exhibition at the Getty Villa highlights the remarkable artifacts from the late Bronze Age Greek site, which was damaged by a recent fire. The centerpiece of the show is the treasure-filled tomb of the "Griffin Warrior," an unknown aristocrat from 3,500 years ago. Among the finds is the Pylos Combat Agate, a tiny seal stone just over an inch long with an incredibly detailed and dramatic battle scene carved into its surface. The exquisite craftsmanship of the agate, likely created with a magnifying lens, challenges established timelines for ancient Greek art and artistic techniques, making it a "little bombshell" for art history.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a columnist reflects on a recent encounter where one of her family's dogs came into contact with a bat that later tested positive for rabies. The experience served as a stark reminder that once-common deadly diseases still exist and that modern society is protected largely due to the success of vaccination programs. She recounts the process of working with veterinarians and public health officials, expressing gratitude that her dog was up to date on its rabies vaccine, which prevented a fatal outcome. The author uses the scare to argue against vaccine complacency, noting that the luxury of not fearing such diseases has made people forgetful of the threats they still pose.</p>

The column suggests that the injection of partisan ideology into scientific funding and the courts allowing challenged policies to proceed could have generational consequences.

          <p>The first onshore wave power project in the United States has been launched at the Port of Los Angeles, marking a new milestone for renewable energy. Developed by the Swedish company Eco Wave Power, the pilot project uses a series of steel floaters attached to a wharf to harness the ocean's movement, generating clean electricity 24/7. This technology differs from more expensive offshore systems by keeping key components on land, making installation and maintenance easier. While the initial output is modest, the project aims to eventually scale up and demonstrate the viability of using existing coastal infrastructure to generate significant amounts of renewable power.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom subsequently provided a California Highway Patrol detail, but the temporary use of LAPD officers drew criticism from the police union. The article discusses the heightened threat level for Harris as a historic figure and the debate over whether public funds should be used for her continued protection, highlighting how even logistical matters can become intensely politicized.</p>

A series of federal actions, including proposed legislation to withhold education funding and directives from the Department of Health and Human Services, aim to compel states to permit religious or personal belief exemptions. These moves, combined with legal challenges from parents, threaten to undermine a mandate credited with significantly boosting vaccination rates in the state.

The report highlighted ongoing concerns, such as the use of lethal force in encounters with individuals showing signs of mental illness and a rise in shootings where officers mistakenly believe a person is armed.
