          <p>President Trump announced his intent to nominate Lindsey Halligan, a senior White House aide and former personal attorney, as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. This decision follows the abrupt resignation of Erik Siebert, the previous U.S. attorney, who reportedly faced significant pressure from the administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. The article details an ongoing Justice Department probe into James for alleged mortgage fraud, which her legal team vigorously denies, characterizing the investigation as an act of political revenge. Trump praised Halligan as "Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!", emphasizing her role in combating what he calls a "Weaponization of our Justice System."</p>

Despite frequent injuries in recent seasons, Trout continues to hit for power and get on base, though his overall playing time has decreased. He expresses loyalty to the Angels, the team that "took a chance on a kid from a little town in southern New Jersey," twice passing up free agency to stay.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011 has resurfaced, showing Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referring to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend," weeks after she publicly distanced herself from him. The Sun and Mail on Sunday published the email, in which the Duchess reportedly stated she had not used the word "paedophilia" in reference to him. A spokesperson for the Duchess explained the email was sent to assuage Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation, asserting she stood by her public condemnation of his actions and that her first thoughts are with his victims.</p>

In a separate, unrelated development, the White House clarified its new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, specifying that it applies exclusively to new applicants and not to current visa holders or those applying for renewals. This clarification was issued to address widespread confusion and is intended to level the playing field for American workers.</p>

          <p>British artist Morrissey canceled two upcoming shows in the U.S. following a credible death threat received before a concert in Ottawa, Canada. A 26-year-old Ottawa man was released on bail after allegedly uttering the threat to the singer, whose real name is Steven Morrissey. While the original Canadian event proceeded as planned, subsequent performances in Massachusetts and Connecticut were canceled "out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and the band." The article notes Morrissey's history of outspokenness on animal welfare and political issues, including a past protest against the Canadian seal hunt, which has often drawn strong reactions.</p>

These detainers are formal requests for local jails and prisons to temporarily hold individuals for federal immigration agents. The article reports that Illinois and New York formally declined cooperation, and California's initial lack of response led DHS to accuse them of obstructing immigration enforcement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of students are struggling with living costs, forcing them to juggle paid work alongside their studies or endure long commutes, as maintenance loans fall significantly short. Research indicates students in England need £61,000 over a three-year degree for a "minimum socially acceptable standard of living," but the maximum annual loan covers only half. The article shares stories of students working 30-hour weeks, missing academic opportunities, or commuting 90 minutes each way to save money. Universities are adapting by offering flexibility, while advocating for the reintroduction of maintenance grants and increased loan amounts.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, including improving short-term memory, mood, and focus, and possibly alleviating "brain fog." The article highlights that while extensive research has focused on its athletic performance enhancement, newer studies are exploring its impact on female biology and other body parts, including brain function, especially during perimenopause. Experts suggest creatine might help by increasing energy production in the brain, similar to its effect on muscles. However, more research is needed, and potential side effects and individual responses vary.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government, led by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, announced its intent to recognize a Palestinian state in September, coinciding with the UN General Assembly. This decision follows mounting pressure from Labour MPs and international allies, making a significant shift in British foreign policy. The article notes that the recognition is conditional on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a two-state solution, conditions unlikely to be met by the current Israeli government. Critics brand the move as "political posturing" or a "reward for terrorism," while proponents believe it will have an impact on the ground.</p>

The proposed bill specifies the statue's design and requires prominent signage proclaiming Kirk a "modern civil rights leader" and "martyr for truth and faith." The article highlights significant criticism of this comparison to Martin Luther King Jr., with MLK III explicitly rejecting it due to Kirk's past controversial statements on race and gender.

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including top CIA deputies and Democratic congressional staffers, without pre-notifying the White House. This action caused significant internal consternation, as officials were reportedly unaware of how the list was compiled or the evidence warranting the revocations. The article highlights that this episode has deepened existing animosity between Gabbard and the CIA, with White House advisors expressing frustration over the perceived blunder. Gabbard, however, stated her actions were at President Trump's direction, targeting individuals allegedly involved in the "politicization or weaponization of intelligence" or leaking classified information.</p>

The article highlights that Afghan officials have expressed opposition to a renewed U.S. presence, while current and former U.S. officials caution that re-occupying Bagram would be akin to a re-invasion, requiring substantial troop deployment and advanced air defenses.

The article highlights the complex legal debate surrounding a state's ability to regulate federal agent conduct, though the law also applies to local police.
