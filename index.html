          <p>The chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Representative John Moolenaar, has warned Panama about the potential for Chinese state influence over the Panama Canal. The warning comes amid reports that Chinese state-owned companies are bidding for concessions to operate key ports at the vital global shipping conduit. In a letter to Panama's maritime authority, Moolenaar expressed alarm over China's "malign influence" and urged officials to ensure that control of the ports does not fall to entities beholden to Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally requested several large California counties, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, to provide lists of all non-citizen inmates currently in their custody. The request includes details on their charges, convictions, and scheduled release dates. This action is part of the Trump administration's stated priority to identify and remove immigrants who have committed crimes after entering the country illegally. The DOJ has indicated it may use subpoenas if the counties do not comply voluntarily with the data request.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has sued the Trump administration to block the termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a key FEMA initiative for funding natural disaster mitigation projects. The lawsuit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the congressionally funded program, a move that threatens to halt critical infrastructure projects like flood control systems. The states contend the decision will leave communities more vulnerable to natural disasters and have requested an injunction to prevent the reallocation of the approved funds.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership is struggling to advance a $9 billion spending cuts package requested by President Trump due to internal disagreements over the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats are leveraging the controversy by proposing amendments to force the release of the documents, creating a difficult political situation for Republicans. The dispute highlights a growing rift within the GOP base concerning the administration's handling of the Epstein case, complicating the legislative agenda ahead of a critical deadline to pass the bill.</p>

          <p>Following public speculation about swelling in his legs, the White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. A memo from the president's physician described the condition as benign and common in older adults, resulting from leg veins struggling to pump blood back to the heart. The diagnosis was confirmed via ultrasound, which ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis, and the physician stated that the president remains in "excellent health" overall.</p>

          <p>A significant data breach has compromised the identities of over 100 British officials, including members of the SAS and MI6, as well as nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for resettlement in the UK. The leak occurred when a UK official inadvertently emailed a massive database of resettlement applications to an individual outside the government. This exposure has put both British personnel and Afghan applicants at serious risk of reprisal from the Taliban, prompting the UK government to create a covert resettlement route for those affected.</p>
