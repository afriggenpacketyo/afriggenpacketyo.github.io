          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to begin trade talks this week in Switzerland, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing trade war between the two largest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will represent China, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the United States. Since President Trump's return to the White House, he has imposed new import taxes on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing on some US goods. These talks represent a significant effort to find a resolution to the trade tensions. Optimism surrounding the talks has led to anticipation for potential positive outcomes.

          <p>CBS News investigates President Trump's claim of securing $9 trillion in new U.S. investments, finding the numbers don't add up. While companies have announced significant planned investments since his inauguration, the White House hasn't provided data to support the $9 trillion figure. Some investments highlighted by the administration were announced before Trump's reelection, and comparisons to the Biden administration are misleading, contrasting future investment pledges with completed projects. Experts caution that investment announcements don't guarantee action, as companies often make such pledges to curry favor with a new administration, and it is too early to directly tie new investments to Trump administration policies.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the mixed reactions to the Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh, both first-time attendees. Some fans felt the stars were dismissed, particularly during Khan's red carpet interview where the Vogue livestream hosts seemed unaware of his global fame. While Vogue noted Khan's clip was included and Nwodim referred to Khan being the first male Bollywood star to appear at the event, the camera quickly panned away from Dosanjh. The incident sparked online disappointment, with many feeling the South Asian superstars deserved more respect on the international stage.</p>

The article also notes the scrutiny from Democratic senators and the potential impact on pending cybercurrency legislation, suggesting Trump's crypto dealings could lead to impeachment if Democrats retake the House.

          <p>India announced its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure." The operation, named "Operation Sindoor," follows a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed 26 people last month. India's Ministry of Defence stated the actions were measured and non-escalatory, avoiding Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war, vowing a robust response. The situation remains tense, with potential for further escalation between the two nuclear powers.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Ross Douthat analyzes how American television portrays the rich through aspiration, judgment, and reassurance, noting that these spirits often coexist. He discusses "Your Friends & Neighbors," an Apple TV show, which eliminates aspirational identification by depicting the wealthy as unhappy and insecure, despite their affluence. The show serves as a direct response to meritocratic status anxiety, portraying the rich world as a place where unhappiness is magnified and financial security is an illusion. Ultimately, Douthat questions the truth of this bleak portrayal, suggesting that while some cultural trends have stripped away elements of fun associated with upper-class lifestyles, many wealthy individuals still manage to enjoy their lucre.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of GCSE students will receive their grades via a new app as part of a government trial in Manchester and the West Midlands. The Education Record app aims to streamline the process and save money for college admissions teams. Students will still have the option to collect their paper results in person. The app will make results available at 11:00 on results day, while in-person collection starts at 08:00. Education minister Stephen Morgan said it was "high time exam records were brought into the 21st century."</p>
