            <p>India's central bank reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, the lowest since September 2022, in an effort to stimulate economic growth. The decision comes as concerns mount over the impact of U.S. reciprocal tariffs, which include a 26% levy on goods from India. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cited increased uncertainties and headwinds for global growth and inflation due to rising tariffs. HSBC predicts the tariffs will directly reduce India's full-year growth by 0.5 percentage points for the financial year ending March 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency, is holding talks to establish binding regulations for phasing out fossil fuel use in global shipping. A key proposal is the implementation of a global emissions tax or carbon credit scheme, which could be a landmark climate deal. However, concerns over U.S. tariffs, a potential trade war, and member reluctance pose challenges to reaching an agreement on a carbon levy. The shipping sector accounts for approximately 3% of global carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>Hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal are fading as tensions escalate, with tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. soaring above 100%. China has adopted a more assertive stance, choosing to retaliate with reciprocal duties. Analysts suggest the conflict could extend beyond trade to technology and geopolitics. Trump has threatened further tariffs if Beijing doesn't back down, but China remains firm. The report underscores the challenges in reaching a resolution and the potential for continued volatility.

            <p>President Trump's latest round of sweeping tariffs, which dramatically increases import duties on goods from major trading partners like China and the EU, has left US businesses shaken. While the administration argues these measures are necessary to restore America's manufacturing base, analysts warn of potential global economic damage. Businesses are uncertain how the escalating trade fight will end and are pausing shipments to assess the situation. The rapid change has created trepidation and uncertainty in the market.

            <p>Chinese researchers have achieved a breakthrough by using a real quantum computer to fine-tune an artificial intelligence (AI) model with 1 billion parameters. The team used Origin Wukong, China's third-generation superconducting quantum computer, to improve training performance by 8.4% while reducing the number of parameters by 76%. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to enhance the training of large language models. The improved AI model also showed better results on specific tasks, such as mental health conversation and math problem-solving.</p>

The country is seen as being unfairly targeted due to its trade surplus with the U.S. The tariffs are considered a bigger crisis than the COVID-19 pandemic due to the uncertainty they create.</p>

Potential measures include restricting purchases of services from US firms, increasing tariffs on US soybeans, and banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films. These suggestions indicate a possible escalation of the trade dispute beyond goods to include services. This shift could have significant implications for US companies operating in China.
