          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including major U.S. allies like the U.K. and Canada, has issued a joint statement demanding an end to the war in Gaza. The statement strongly condemns Israel for the "inhumane killing of civilians" and for its restrictive "drip feeding of aid," which has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. The nations also called for the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas. This international pressure mounts as Israel announces an expansion of its ground operations into new areas of central Gaza, displacing tens of thousands more Palestinians and raising concerns for the safety of remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Malcolm-Jamal Warner, the actor celebrated for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54 in an accidental drowning incident in Costa Rica. Officials reported he was caught in a strong current while swimming. Warner's career extended well beyond the iconic sitcom, earning him a Grammy Award in 2015 and roles in numerous other television shows. Friends and colleagues, including Bill Cosby, remembered him as a kind, professional, and culturally conscious artist who was deeply concerned with the representation of Black Americans in media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has initiated proceedings to deport lawful permanent residents accused of supporting or collaborating with violent gangs in Haiti. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the move targets individuals linked to the Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which the Trump administration has designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The announcement coincided with the reported arrest in Miami of Pierre Reginald Boulos, a prominent Haitian businessman and former presidential candidate. This policy is a response to the escalating gang violence that has destabilized Haiti, causing thousands of deaths and widespread displacement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 200,000 pages of previously sealed FBI records concerning the surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr. The release proceeded despite objections from King's family, who warned against weaponizing the documents to tarnish his legacy. In a statement, his children contextualized the files as products of a "predatory" government campaign to discredit the Civil Rights Movement and reiterated their belief that King was killed in a conspiracy. Critics like Al Sharpton framed the release as a political distraction from other controversies facing the administration.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that a vote on a resolution calling for the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein will not occur before Congress's August recess. Johnson stated the administration needs "space to do what it is doing," following a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury transcripts. The delay has drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, like Rep. Thomas Massie, who are pushing for immediate transparency. The move comes amid intense public and political pressure on the Trump administration to disclose more information about the deceased sex offender.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has released declassified documents related to the 2016 Russia investigation, claiming they show evidence of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials to undermine Donald Trump. Gabbard's memo alleges manipulation of intelligence, a claim fiercely disputed by Democrats who point to multiple bipartisan reports confirming Russian interference. Critics, including Rep.

          <p>Following deadly floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is urging President Trump to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting systems, arguing it is a matter of public safety and fiscal responsibility. In a letter to the president, the Democratic senator outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading Doppler radar and weather satellites. The call for investment comes as the Trump administration has proposed significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Cantwell contends that proactive investment could reduce the multi-billion dollar costs associated with increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Emil Bove, one of President Trump's most controversial judicial nominees, who is close to securing a position on the federal bench. During his first term, Trump significantly reshaped the federal courts by appointing conservative, originalist judges, often selected with the help of the Federalist Society. The piece suggests that the nomination of figures like Bove indicates a continuation of this strategy. It frames Bove as a potential face of a new "MAGA judiciary," prompting consideration of how the administration's judicial nomination process is evolving in its second term.</p>

          <p>Despite China reporting robust headline economic figures, many citizens are experiencing a starkly different reality of financial strain and job insecurity. The article highlights the story of an accountant in Chengdu who has not had a raise in five years and now faces potential layoffs, making his dream of homeownership unattainable. A University of Hong Kong finance professor notes this growing disconnect between official data and the actual feelings of households and businesses. This sentiment reflects a broader uncertainty about the future and a weak job market felt on the ground.</p>

          <p>The judge assigned to Donald Trump's $10 billion libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal is Darrin Gayles, the same federal judge who presided over a previous lawsuit Trump filed and later dropped against Michael Cohen. In that earlier case, Trump withdrew the suit after Judge Gayles scheduled a deposition for the then-president. The assignment raises the possibility that Trump could again face being questioned under oath, this time by Murdoch's legal team, about his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Commentators are divided on whether Trump will pursue the case or withdraw as he did before.</p>

          <p>The Texas Legislature has begun a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, a move pushed by the Trump administration to increase the number of Republican-held seats in the U.S. House. With a slim GOP majority in Congress, this mid-decade redistricting effort is seen as a purely political maneuver to benefit the party in the 2026 midterm elections. The Justice Department has also weighed in, alleging that several current districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Critics argue the plan is legally and politically risky and could undermine the voting power of communities of color.</p>

Despite having a work permit, he is being held in a Georgia facility and faces removal proceedings. Guevara, who previously leaned Republican, says the experience has made him reconsider his political alignment and warns Latino voters against supporting an administration that acts against their community.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's new tax bill will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. The legislation makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, including a reduced corporate rate, while offsetting only a fraction of the lost revenue with $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. These cuts are expected to leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034. The bill also boosts funding for border security and immigration enforcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration clashed in federal court over the government's decision to freeze more than $2 billion in federal grants to the university, ostensibly to combat antisemitism. Harvard's lawyers argued the move harms vital public research and is an attempt to control the university's internal affairs. Government lawyers contended the cuts are a necessary punishment for anti-Jewish bias on campus. The presiding judge expressed skepticism about the administration's claims, questioning how cutting medical research funding would address antisemitism and calling the government's legal reasoning "mind-boggling."</p>
