          <p>North Korea has successfully launched a warship, just two weeks after an initial launch attempt resulted in damage and harsh criticism from leader Kim Jong Un. The 5,000-tonne destroyer is now moored at a pier, according to state media, after workers used barrage balloons and tethers to restore its balance. Kim Jong Un had previously condemned the failed launch as a "criminal act" resulting from carelessness and unscientific empiricism, leading to the arrest of at least four officials. Analysts suggest Kim's swift response indicates the regime's commitment to advancing its military capabilities and protecting his image as a leader of a rising military power, with the warship expected to be deployed early next year.</p>

          <p>Numerous undocumented immigrants were detained at their scheduled ICE check-in appointments at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in Los Angeles, with some held overnight in the building's basement. Immigration lawyers report that hundreds were detained, with dozens held in rooms designed to accommodate up to 30 people. Attorneys describe the conditions as inhumane, with limited access to food and water; one family, including a U.S. citizen child, was detained despite the father having a stay of removal. ICE arrests have surged under the Trump administration, with daily arrests significantly exceeding those during Biden's last year in office, raising concerns about the capacity to handle large-scale deportations.</p>

          <p>At the SuperReturn conference in Berlin, private equity leaders acknowledged that a previously anticipated boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized, putting pressure on the industry. Despite this, attendees displayed a strong resolve, defending against the narrative that dealmaking is declining and highlighting growth opportunities in areas like European defense firms and Middle Eastern data centers. Experts noted that exits have slowed due to geopolitical tensions and public market volatility, leading companies to remain private longer. Some argue that private equity continues to outperform public markets over the long term, while others point to the high prices paid during the recent period of low interest rates as a challenge to achieving target returns.

This decision follows prolonged water outages after the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture, both highlighting the urgent need for infrastructure maintenance and disaster preparedness. Key allocations include funds for maintaining vital services, repairing sewer pipes, reinforcing bridges, and constructing disaster prevention infrastructure like erosion control dams and river embankments.</p>

          <p>A public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has elicited responses from various figures, including billionaires, politicians, and pundits. The conflict began after Musk criticized Trump's tax-cut and spending bill, leading to online exchanges where Trump threatened to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies. Bill Ackman urged the two to reconcile, while Steve Bannon suggested Trump seize control of SpaceX and suspend federal contracts with Musk. The disagreement has sparked debates about political allegiances and the influence of billionaires in American politics, with some suggesting the creation of a new political party.</p>

          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually because of lost, damaged, or missing evidence, according to data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offenses, due to issues such as lost physical or digital evidence, unavailable witness statements, and key evidence not gathered from crime scenes. A leading criminologist attributes the increase to resourcing issues following cuts to police forces, while former officers cite the overwhelming amount of evidence they handle. The BBC's findings highlight the increasing proportion of prosecutions failing due to unavailable evidence, impacting victims' mental states and potentially endangering the public.</p>

However, tariffs remain on many imports, leading companies like Pepsi, Goldman Sachs, and Target to warn of potential losses due to uncertainty. Consumer spending, a key economic driver, could weaken if import costs rise, though unemployment remains low and inflation has cooled. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Innovative Program Forces Sanctuary Cities to Comply with Federal Immigration Rules</h2>

          <p>Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, aims to force sanctuary cities to cooperate with federal immigration authorities by using judicial warrants to detain criminal illegal aliens. The program targets illegal aliens with prior deportations who are arrested locally, seeking federal criminal warrants for felony re-entry. This approach bypasses sanctuary cities' policies of ignoring ICE detainer warrants, leading to the arrest of numerous individuals. The article argues that every U.S. Attorney's office should adopt this strategy to restore immigration law enforcement and remove criminal illegal aliens from sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>Pride celebrations are moving forward despite a corporate exodus that has resulted in significant budget shortfalls for organizers. Many Pride organizations have reported a 20% to 30% decrease in corporate support, attributed to financial strain, internal transitions, and fear of backlash. Some brands became "silent partners," donating without public acknowledgement, while others scaled back or withdrew their support altogether. Despite the challenges, organizers are determined to hold Pride events, but express concerns about the long-term impact on year-round programming and community support.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Copyright Office is experiencing unprecedented turmoil, including the abrupt firing of its ex-head, Shira Perlmutter, and a lawsuit against President Trump. This occurs as the office releases a report on whether using copyrighted works to train generative AI constitutes fair use, potentially influencing numerous lawsuits. The report concludes that the fairness of such use depends on the specific circumstances, and the Copyright Office paused issuing new registration certificates. Experts describe the situation as a foreshadowing of the generative AI battle and note the unusual nature of these events within the normally stable agency.</p>

          <p>The FAA aims to modernize the U.S. air traffic control system, replacing outdated technology like floppy disks and paper strips. However, this ambitious goal faces challenges due to decades of underinvestment and failed attempts at modernization. While Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy estimates the price tag is in the tens of billions of dollars and wants to complete it within four years, former FAA administrators emphasize the need for increased funding and the difficulty of shutting down old equipment. The article notes that consolidation of air traffic control facilities could be politically challenging, and some industry experts are skeptical about the aggressive timetable.</p>

          <p>Senior Trump adviser Kari Lake plans to drastically reduce the staff at Voice of America, potentially diminishing the network's ability to provide accurate and comprehensive news to a global audience. Lake intends to maintain a minimal staff to comply with statutory requirements, which is being challenged in federal court. Former VOA leaders argue that gutting the workforce would effectively kill the network, undermining its role as an important source of soft power for the United States. This move follows cancellations of contracts with international news wires and a deal to offer programming from One America News Network, raising concerns about the agency's future.</p>

O'Brien has a history of hardline stances on immigration and a high asylum denial rate, raising concerns about the neutrality of immigration judges. The move has sparked debate about the politicization of immigration courts, with some viewing it as compensation for his unfair firing and others as a threat to the courts' impartiality. Critics fear the administration is transforming immigration courts into a "deportation factory" by bringing back like-minded civil servants.</p>

          <p>The feud between President Trump and Elon Musk raises questions about the future of government subsidies and contracts for Musk's companies, particularly SpaceX and Tesla. SpaceX's critical role in the U.S. space program and national security, including building spy satellites and providing Starlink services, makes it difficult to imagine the government cancelling contracts. However, Tesla could be affected by potential cuts to electric vehicle tax credits and federal funding for charging stations, although some experts believe other issues, such as focusing on the Cybertruck, pose a greater threat to the company. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld suggests further pain for Tesla could eventually plunge Musk's riches.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, overturning the 2022 court decision ordering the former executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The presiding judge said the government's earthquake assessment did not provide a sufficient basis for the utility to swiftly conduct construction work to protect against a huge tsunami, but added that in the future, executives of nuclear plant operators should be considered as bearing greater responsibility.</p>

The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes. The new rules will be included in the Future Homes Standard, and while the government has not committed to the previous Conservative government's proposed 40% figure, they are promising to require some solar panels even if that target cannot be met.</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The move, a third consecutive rate cut since February, aims to address lower-than-anticipated growth amidst a challenging global environment. The decision was influenced by softened inflation and better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While maintaining its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, the RBI revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% and shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further easing.
