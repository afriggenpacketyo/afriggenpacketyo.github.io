          <h2>Wall Street Rebounds After Initial Tariff-Induced Losses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 18:49:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a period of market volatility triggered by President Trump's imposition of global tariffs, Wall Street experienced a significant recovery, driven primarily by gains in the technology sector, with Microsoft and Nvidia leading the charge. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both surged by 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 1.4%. This resurgence, marking the ninth consecutive day of gains, was fueled by a surprisingly positive jobs report indicating the addition of 177,000 new jobs in April, coupled with renewed optimism surrounding potential US-China trade negotiations. While some analysts suggest that the jobs data alleviates concerns about a looming recession, others caution that the long-term effects of the tariffs remain uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's latest budget proposal seeks to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), along with the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, echoing similar efforts from his first term that were ultimately thwarted by bipartisan congressional support. The proposal, justified as a measure to decrease the size of the federal government and enhance accountability, has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who view it as an attack on the arts. Despite past failures to eliminate these endowments, the Trump administration has already begun to curtail their activities by canceling grants and reducing staff, raising concerns about the future of arts funding and cultural initiatives across the country.</p>

          <h2>Trump Struggles to Defend Tariff Policies Amid Rising Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is facing criticism for his defense of tariff policies, which he claims will have minimal impact on American consumers, suggesting they might only have to buy fewer dolls. This message contrasts sharply with previous promises of ending inflation and delivering economic benefits without sacrifice. Experts argue that the tariffs represent a significant tax increase for Americans, and Trump's inability to acknowledge their pain is contributing to declining approval ratings on the economy. The article contrasts Trump's approach with past presidents who asked for sacrifices during times of crisis, noting his difficulty in convincing ordinary Americans that he understands their struggles.</p>

Health officials caution that it is too soon to determine if the outbreak is ending, and they are monitoring for potential increases related to Easter holiday travel.

          <p>George H. Ryan, the former governor of Illinois who imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in 2000 due to concerns about wrongful convictions, has died at the age of 91. Ryan, a Republican, cited a "shameless record of convicting innocent people" as the reason for his decision, which sparked a national debate over capital punishment. Later in his life, Ryan was convicted on corruption charges related to his time as Illinois Secretary of State and served time in prison. His actions on the death penalty drew praise from world leaders, while his corruption conviction marked a significant fall from grace.</p>

          <p>Radio Free Asia (RFA) is implementing mass layoffs, affecting approximately 90% of its staff, and shutting down numerous language services due to a funding fight with the Trump administration. President Trump ordered the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to minimize operations, leading to the termination of congressionally appropriated grants to RFA and other U.S. government-funded broadcasters. A federal judge had previously ordered the administration to reinstate RFA's funds, but a D.C. appeals court granted an administrative stay, freezing the court order.</p>

Ia Sukhitashvili's performance portrays Nina as stoic and emotionally distant, with her actions often inscrutable.

While the White House is expected to request Congress claw back the CPB's allocated funds, legal challenges are anticipated, with public media executives vowing to fight the order. The CPB argues that most of its funding goes to local public radio and TV stations that serve as vital sources of journalism in their communities.</p>
