          <h2>Trump Appoints Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as Interim NASA Chief</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the interim head of NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The president cited Isaacman's Democratic political donations and his close professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX holds major NASA contracts, as reasons for the change. Duffy's appointment comes at a critical time for the space agency as it pursues missions to return astronauts to the moon and eventually to Mars. Duffy is the latest official in the administration to hold dual roles in the government.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy rate steady at 2.5% to evaluate the effectiveness of recent measures designed to control Seoul's rapidly inflating housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged by over 19% in June, prompting authorities to act against the expansion of household debt. Despite a minor economic contraction earlier in the year, the central bank prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. Officials cited the need to assess policy impacts amid rising housing market risks and potential foreign exchange volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will implement a 50% tariff on all copper imports starting August 1, a decision based on a national security assessment. The White House emphasized copper's critical role in defense, technology, and infrastructure, stating the tariff aims to revive the domestic copper industry. The move has already caused a significant spike in copper prices, with analysts forecasting potential price increases for U.S. consumers on a wide range of goods and services.

          <p>Recent U.S. tariff announcements targeting transshipments from Southeast Asia have created significant uncertainty for Chinese manufacturers who have relocated operations to the region. These companies, which moved to avoid direct tariffs on Chinese goods, now face ambiguity as Washington has threatened high levies without providing clear implementation details. The policy has put a damper on Chinese investment in the region, as businesses are forced to adopt a cautious wait-and-see approach. This development directly impacts the profitability and strategic planning for many small and medium-sized Chinese exporters.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian aggression, reversing a recent pause in some shipments. The Pentagon confirmed the decision, stating the goal is to ensure Ukraine can protect itself while diplomatic efforts for a lasting peace continue. The move comes after the president expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian populations. The White House had previously halted some arms transfers as part of a broader review of global military aid.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner has ruled that the death of Lucrecia Macias Barajas, a 46-year-old U.S. Army veteran, was an accidental overdose from the combined effects of fentanyl and methamphetamine.

The encampment had previously been the site of another death and injury earlier in the year.

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to raise prices for American consumers on a wide array of goods, according to economists and industry experts. Copper is a vital component in electrical wiring, appliances, electronics, and vehicles, and the tariff could lead to inflation across these sectors. While the administration argues the tariff will incentivize domestic production and create manufacturing jobs, analysts note that ramping up U.S. copper mining would be a multi-year process. The U.S. currently imports over half of its copper, primarily from Chile and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

The report highlighted a series of law enforcement breakdowns that left the then-presidential candidate vulnerable.

          <p>The European Union has expressed optimism that a framework for a trade agreement with the United States could be reached within days, even as the Trump administration escalates its global trade war. President Trump recently announced new tariff threats against multiple countries, including a steep 50% tariff on Brazil and potential levies on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Despite the aggressive U.S. posture, EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic indicated that significant progress has been made in negotiations. The new tariff threats, if enacted, would push U.S. duties to their highest levels in nearly a century.</p>

A former county official who helped install the system noted the delay occurred during a critical window.

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest number of infections recorded in 33 years and surpassing the total from the significant 2019 outbreak. The majority of cases are linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, which resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the nearly-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates, as coverage has fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity. The CDC maintains that the risk to the general population is low but is higher in communities with low vaccination coverage.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for mass layoffs of federal workers across numerous agencies. The decision allows the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to significantly reduce the size of the federal government. A coalition of labor unions had successfully sued to block the layoffs, arguing the president exceeded his authority, but the Supreme Court found the government was likely to succeed in its legal argument. The ruling deals a blow to federal unions and affects thousands of government employees.</p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted city services, most notably causing widespread trash accumulation. The 9,000 striking workers, including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, secured a three-year contract with 3% annual raises and a one-time $1,500 bonus. The agreement was a significant compromise from the union's initial 32% wage increase demand. Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm on affordability, and workers began returning to their jobs immediately, with trash cleanup expected to be completed by the weekend.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece explores how Pixar's animated film 'Elio,' about a boy who feels like an outsider, resonates with the current political climate surrounding immigration and ICE raids in the United States. The author argues that the movie's themes of alienation and finding belonging speak directly to the experiences of Latino children witnessing anti-immigrant policies. The article also touches on claims that the protagonist's queer identity was removed from the film during production. Ultimately, it suggests that the fear generated by immigration enforcement may have negatively impacted the film's box office performance by deterring Latino families from going to theaters.</p>
