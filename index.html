          <p>Investing $500,000 in an annuity can provide a substantial monthly income, but the exact amount varies based on several factors. These factors include the annuitant's age, gender, the type of annuity chosen (fixed, variable, immediate, or deferred), and the prevailing interest rate environment. Monthly payouts could range from $2,600 to over $5,200, according to an analysis of Cannex data by Annuity.org. Choosing the right annuity requires careful consideration of individual retirement needs, risk tolerance, and financial goals, as well as comparing different annuity types and checking the financial strength of the provider.

Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there's a $10,000 limit on the federal deduction on state and local taxes, known as SALT, which will sunset after 2025 without action from Congress.

The Trump administration instituted 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports starting April 2, which came on top of other select duties he had leveled previously.

          <p>Ethics experts are questioning the implications of President Trump's potential acceptance of a luxury plane from the Qatari government. The gift, estimated to be worth around $400 million, raises concerns about violations of the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause, which prohibits public office holders from accepting gifts from foreign states. Critics worry that accepting the plane could lead to Trump feeling beholden to the Qatari government and could incentivize other countries to offer similar gifts to influence presidential decision-making.</p>
