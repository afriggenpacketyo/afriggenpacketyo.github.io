          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her bid to have her fraud conviction appeal reheard by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, effectively exhausting her options within the appellate system. Holmes was found guilty in January 2022 of deceiving investors about Theranos' blood-testing capabilities and was subsequently sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison. With this denial, her last recourse is to petition the Supreme Court to hear the case, a move that legal experts view as a long shot given the established precedent and the thoroughness of the initial trial and appeals process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the termination of a humanitarian parole program affecting over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela. This program, known as CHNV, granted temporary legal status and work authorization to these individuals. The administration argues that a lower court's decision to halt the termination infringes upon the Executive Branch's authority over immigration policy and foreign affairs. Critics of the move contend that ending the program would destabilize communities and disrupt the lives of those who relied on its protections, raising concerns about the potential humanitarian consequences.</p>

The autopsy showed only two bullet wounds instead of three, none of which directly hit the heart, leading forensic pathologists to conclude that Mahdi likely bled out over time while conscious. This has led Mahdi's lawyers to file a claim with the South Carolina Supreme Court arguing that the execution was botched and constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to discontinue tracking the costs associated with billion-dollar disasters, citing evolving priorities and staffing changes.

Experts fear that the absence of this consistent and trusted record will hinder efforts to assess climate risks, allocate resources, and make informed decisions about infrastructure investments. The NOAA will make archived data from 1980 to 2024 available, but future disaster costs will not be tracked.</p>

Trump believes Powell's reluctance is hindering economic growth, especially given that other countries have already implemented rate cuts. The Fed, however, is maintaining its current interest rate range due to concerns about economic uncertainty and potential inflation resulting from Trump's trade policies. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the goal of maximizing employment and price stability.</p>

But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. This isn't a trade deal, but an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods. What was announced today is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement.</p>

          <p>An underwater volcano located 300 miles off the coast of Oregon, known as Axial Seamount, shows signs of potential eruption. Scientists monitoring the volcano have detected an increase in earthquakes and swelling of the structure, indicating it is filling with molten rock. While the eruption poses no direct threat to humans due to its remote location and depth, it offers a valuable opportunity for researchers to study and refine eruption forecasting techniques. The volcano has erupted three times in the past 30 years, and scientists are analyzing patterns of activity to improve prediction models.</p>

While Trump has expressed support for raising the top tax rate, Johnson and other Republicans have resisted the idea.
