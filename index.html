          <p>Daniel Born, the Social Democrat deputy speaker of Baden-Württemberg's parliament, has resigned after admitting to drawing a swastika on a ballot paper. This controversial act, which Born labeled a "serious mistake" and a "momentary lapse," took place during a vote for deputy members to the cross-border Upper Rhine Council, with the symbol appearing next to a far-right AfD lawmaker's name. The incident highlights Germany's profound historical sensitivity concerning Nazi symbols and the immediate political consequences for such transgressions. His resignation underscores the country's unwavering commitment to democratic principles and the expectation of swift accountability for actions that evoke its dark past.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker revealed her early financial struggles, living on $40 for three days after moving out at 18, which taught her the profound security of paying bills. Adjusting for inflation, that $40 is equivalent to about $132 today. The article highlights how this experience shaped her understanding of financial stability, prioritizing it over fame. Financial experts in the article offer contemporary advice for freelancers and gig workers, suggesting a "bucketing strategy" for income allocation rather than strict rationing, emphasizing building an emergency fund to absorb income volatility. This approach aims to help individuals shift out of a scarcity mindset and develop sustainable financial habits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Trump's visit to open a new course at Trump International Golf Links in Scotland, local residents shared mixed reactions, often intertwining his politics with his business. David Milne, a neighbor who refused to sell his property, lamented the loss of the untouched landscape, viewing the golf course as a lesser alternative. While the course employs over 80 people and has a positive economic impact, many Scots, including a walking club, hold grudges over how neighbors were treated. Veteran labor union activist Tommy Campbell plans protests, declaring Trump unwelcome due to policies at odds with local values, underscoring deep-seated local divisions.</p>

          <p>The Republican Study Committee (RSC), a significant 189-member House GOP group, has launched a working group to outline a potential second "big, beautiful bill" for President Trump's agenda. This move aims to capitalize on momentum from their initial reconciliation bill, which made parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and imposed new work requirements. RSC Chairman August Pfluger stated the goal is to further drive down living costs and restore America's promise. This legislative effort underscores the GOP's intent to utilize the budget reconciliation process, which bypasses the Senate's 60-vote threshold for fiscal policy, to push through comprehensive partisan reforms.</p>

          <p>A newly released NTSB report has concluded that excessive moose meat and antlers improperly secured to a wing were primary factors in the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene “Buzzy” Peltola Jr., husband of then-Alaska Democratic congresswoman Mary Peltola. Peltola Jr. was flying alone, and the Piper PA-18 plane exceeded its maximum certified gross weight by nearly 120lbs, with antlers tied "cupped upward and perpendicular to the direction of flight." Investigators determined these unapproved modifications and overloading led to "degraded takeoff performance and flight characteristics," causing him to lose control. Peltola Jr. initially survived but succumbed to his injuries hours later, underscoring the critical importance of adhering to aircraft weight limits and safety regulations.</p>

          <p>Uncertainty now surrounds the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release negotiations after both US envoy Steve Witkoff and the Israeli negotiating team departed Doha. Witkoff asserted that Hamas displayed "a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire," prompting the US to consider "alternative options." Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu's office also confirmed its team's withdrawal for consultations. Conversely, Hamas expressed surprise at these "negative statements," with an official indicating that mediators had informed them of the Israeli delegation's expected return next week. The core impasse remains Hamas's demand for a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel insists on hostage release and Hamas disarmament, further exacerbating the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

While ICE defends the practice as necessary for agent safety, lawmakers are advocating for legislation that would mandate visible identification.

          <p>The ongoing Jeffrey Epstein case and the Trump administration's fluctuating position on releasing related files are creating significant fissures within the online MAGA conspiracy wing. While some loyalists maintain unwavering trust in President Trump's strategic acumen, others are vocally demanding full transparency, criticizing his perceived stonewalling. A recent Justice Department and FBI memo, which dismissed the "Epstein didn't kill himself" theory and denied the existence of a "client list," has further exacerbated this internal frustration. This dynamic reveals the complex challenge for prominent MAGA influencers as they attempt to reconcile their support for the president with their long-held advocacy for complete disclosure regarding the Epstein saga.</p>

          <p>The food distribution system in Gaza since late May has devolved into a "horror," with over 1,000 Palestinians reportedly killed seeking aid at centers overseen by Israeli and US governments. Prime Minister Netanyahu's March blockade and subsequent military offensive created untenable conditions, leading to the establishment of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), funded by the Trump administration. GHF's few distribution points are described as "killing fields" where Israeli troops allegedly open fire for crowd control, and US contractors are accused of deliberate shootings. Traditional aid agencies are largely barred, leaving GHF with a monopoly, and the situation is appalling, with mass starvation looming.</p>

          <p>South Park co-creator Trey Parker delivered a mock apology to President Donald Trump after the animated show's 27th season premiere controversially depicted him naked with Satan and satirized his litigiousness. The White House swiftly condemned the episode as "fourth-rate" and irrelevant, asserting Trump's achievements. The episode also comically addressed the recent Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger, which received FCC approval after Paramount settled a prior legal dispute with Trump. Despite the political backlash, the show's creators recently secured a five-year, $1.5 billion deal with Paramount+ for new episodes, underscoring its enduring cultural impact and capacity for sharp political commentary.</p>

          <p>Brussels is actively preparing for a "no-deal" trade scenario with the United States, as the prospect of a comprehensive trade agreement remains uncertain before the August 1 deadline for potential 30% US tariffs on EU imports. European lawmakers have already approved a substantial package of counter-tariffs, targeting a wide range of goods valued at 93 billion euros, and discussions are underway to potentially deploy the EU's robust "trade bazooka" — its anti-coercion instrument. Experts anticipate a "tit-for-tat" retaliatory approach from the EU, involving reciprocal 30% tariffs on specific US goods. However, President Trump's unpredictable decision-making introduces high uncertainty, compelling the EU to be ready for immediate and proportionate responses.</p>

          <p>A tense bilateral summit in Beijing between Chinese President Xi Jinping and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen exposed deepening geopolitical and trade tensions, yielding only modest progress. EU leaders voiced concerns over China's export surplus flooding European markets and its alleged support for Russia's war in Ukraine, while Xi called for open trade and cautioned against restrictive economic tools. Despite the disagreements, both sides agreed to "step up" efforts on climate change and establish an "upgraded export supply mechanism" for rare earth materials. Analysts suggest this summit is unlikely to alter the long-term trajectory of strained EU-China relations, urging Europe to re-evaluate its broader China strategy.</p>

Long-simmering tensions, recently exacerbated by a Cambodian soldier's death and a landmine incident, led to both nations downgrading diplomatic relations.

          <p>President Trump has significantly escalated his "media war" by filing a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. The lawsuit was prompted by an article detailing a sexually suggestive birthday card Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. This legal action aligns with Trump's established pattern of using courts to target media outlets, including previous settlements with CBS and ABC, and imposing penalties on others like Voice of America. Analysts suggest the lawsuit's objectives are multi-fold: to exact vengeance, discredit unfavorable reporting, and issue a stern warning to other news organizations, thereby asserting greater control over independent media narratives.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that the death of 19-year-old Jay Slater in Tenerife was accidental, resulting from a fall down a ravine. Slater, from Lancashire, went missing on June 17, 2024, after informing friends he was "in the middle of the mountains" and thirsty, attempting a 14-hour walk home following a night of drug and alcohol consumption. The inquest at Preston Coroner's Court concluded he died instantly from skull fractures and brain trauma sustained from a fall of up to 25 meters. Contributing factors included his unsuitable attire, lack of sleep, insufficient mountain training, and the potential after-effects of the substances consumed, providing some closure for his grieving family.</p>

Under the agreement, 92% of UK exports to India will see tariffs removed or reduced, while 99% of Indian goods shipped to Britain will become tariff-exempt.
