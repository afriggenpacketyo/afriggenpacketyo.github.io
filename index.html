        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has announced housing market reform plans aimed at reducing costs, delays, and failed sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated that the changes would "fix the broken system" and save money for working people. First-time buyers could save an average of £710, and property transaction timelines could be reduced by up to four weeks. The proposals include legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide key property information upfront, such as home condition, leasehold costs, and property chain details. Binding contracts may also be introduced to prevent parties from walking away late in the deal, halving the number of failed transactions. A new mandatory Code of Practice for estate agents and conveyancers is being proposed to boost professional standards across the housing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article discusses China's need to shift its economic strategy from export dominance to becoming the world's largest importer. The author argues that this transition would mark a pivotal evolution in China's economic strategy and carry significant geopolitical and economic implications. The upcoming 15th five-year plan is critical for China to accelerate its transition to a consumption-driven economy and address structural imbalances. This shift would require prioritizing domestic demand over investment and exports, fostering a more balanced and sustainable economic model. Embracing this new era would signify a move from 'made in China' to 'consumed in China.'</p>

          <p>A man was arrested and charged with possessing a Molotov cocktail outside the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C., prior to the Red Mass. Louis Geri, 41, was apprehended after setting up a tent on the church steps and refusing to leave; he had previously been barred from the Cathedral. Police discovered suspicious items inside the tent, including vials of liquid and possible fireworks, prompting a response from the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team and the Arson Task Force. Geri faces charges including unlawful entry, threats to kidnap or injure, and possession of a Molotov cocktail, though his motive remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla strengthened into a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean and is expected to intensify further, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm formed off the west coast of Mexico and is forecast to move parallel to the land, bringing dangerous surf and possible flooding. Tropical storm watches are in effect for a significant portion of the Mexican coastline. While Priscilla is not expected to make direct landfall, tropical storm conditions and heavy rainfall could affect coastal areas, potentially causing flash flooding and life-threatening rip currents. Residents are advised to monitor updates and heed warnings from local authorities.</p>

          <p>Several Indiana Republicans, including Governor Mike Braun and Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith, criticized Indianapolis leaders for violence following the stabbing of Mark Sanchez, before Sanchez was charged in the incident. Braun and Beckwith deleted their tweets calling for state intervention, but Indianapolis Councilor Michael-Paul Hart's post remained. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears responded to Braun, accusing him of exploiting violence for political gain. Sanchez was arrested on misdemeanor charges after an altercation with a 69-year-old man who stabbed him in self-defense, according to court documents. Violent crime statistics show a decrease in homicides this summer compared to last year.</p>

          <p>Three experienced cavers were rescued after being trapped for over 30 hours in Dowber Gill Passage, North Yorkshire, during Storm Amy. The alarm was raised when they failed to return, prompting a rescue operation involving over 100 volunteers from various caving teams. Worsening weather, flooding, and challenging terrain hampered the rescue efforts, with rising water levels making the simplest exit route impassable. The cavers were eventually guided to safety, exhausted but unharmed, after enduring cold and wet conditions. The successful rescue was attributed to the cavers sharing their route details beforehand.</p>

          <p>The Conservative party is invoking Margaret Thatcher's legacy at their annual conference, celebrating 100 years since her birth. With the party facing poor poll numbers, activists are looking to Thatcher's leadership for inspiration. Leader Kemi Badenoch is reportedly drawing from Thatcher's early years in power. The party is debating whether Thatcherite policies hold lessons for Badenoch as she attempts to revive the Tories' fortunes, with some suggesting a focus on reining in government bodies and promoting enterprise. The economy is seen as a key area for the Conservatives to regain public trust.</p>

Trump said negotiations were "going very well", and that he heard there was no need for flexibility. Israeli air strikes continue in Gaza despite Trump's call to halt the bombing, but the Secretary of State Marco Rubio said bombing needs to stop to facilitate a hostage release.</p>
