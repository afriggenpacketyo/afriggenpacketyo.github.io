          <h2>UK Government Considers Expanding Sugar Tax to Milkshakes and Lattes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 03:28:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, including non-dairy alternatives. This move aims to tackle obesity, particularly among children, by incentivizing manufacturers to reduce sugar content. While the original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to concerns about calcium intake, the government now believes the harms of excess sugar outweigh the benefits. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage criticized the measure, while health advocates welcomed the potential expansion, citing the success of the original tax in reducing sugar in soft drinks. The consultation will run until July 21st, with the industry already reducing sugar content by a substantial amount in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars announced plans to cut costs by $1.87 billion after its operating profit fell sharply in the first quarter of the year. The decline is attributed to planned inventory reductions, adverse currency effects, and increased competition in the electric vehicle market. The company's cost-cutting measures will include reductions in investments and potential layoffs at its global operations, with more details to be released later. CEO Håkan Samuelsson cited a heavy headwind in the market, including price competition from new EV players and potential tariffs, making it difficult to predict the future. Shares of Volvo Cars fell sharply following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is encouraging the public to draw inspiration from Mao Zedong's essay "On Protracted War" as a guide to navigating ongoing economic tensions with the United States.

It emphasizes the importance of avoiding defeatist attitudes and unrealistic expectations of a quick resolution. This call to revisit historical strategies comes amid escalating tariff measures between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won Canada's federal election, a stunning turnaround fueled by anti-Trump sentiment. The victory comes after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation earlier in the year. Carney successfully framed the election as a fight for Canada's economic survival against President Trump's tariff threats and comments undermining Canadian sovereignty. While the Conservatives made significant gains, they fell short of securing a majority. The results highlight divisions within Canada, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where alienation from Ottawa remains strong.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party achieved a significant victory in the Canadian election, largely due to the influence of Donald Trump. The US president's constant threats towards Canada and suggestions of annexation coincided with a reversal of fortune for the Liberal Party. Carney focused his campaign on the threat posed by Trump to Canada's sovereignty and economy. This victory breaks the trend of incumbent governments losing ground, and positions Canada to potentially seek stronger partnerships with Europe.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers have been released from prison after serving sentences related to national security convictions. Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki served over four years on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion. The charges stemmed from their participation in an unofficial primary poll in 2020. Critics argue that the lawsuit was part of a broader assault by Beijing on rights and democracy in Hong Kong following the imposition of the national security law.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower GDP and export growth in the first quarter compared to the rest of the country. The city's GDP grew by 5.2%, falling short of China's overall 5.4% gain, while exports declined by 8.7%. Experts attribute this underperformance to a high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the tariff war and industrial transition. Some enterprises are facing high costs and insufficient orders, putting pressure on foreign trade and exports.</p>

Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st state played a significant role in the campaign. Carney called a snap election shortly after taking office to seek a "strong, positive mandate" amid the unpopularity of his party.</p>

          <p>F1's regulations change from time to time due to the governing body feeling the need to intervene in some way. The new engine rules are to make the sport more attractive to new manufacturers, which worked as Audi came in and Ford came back, in partnership with Red Bull. The new rules retain 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, and the electrical capacity has been upped so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, and will run on 100% sustainable fuel. The new engine rules required further changes, so moveable aerodynamics were introduced to reduce drag on the straights.</p>
