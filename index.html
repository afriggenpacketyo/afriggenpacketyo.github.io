          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, set to begin next month. The move is explicitly linked to the ongoing criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which the U.S. leader described as a "Witch Hunt." This action is part of a broader tariff strategy, but the rate for Brazil is the highest threatened so far. In response, Brazilian President Lula da Silva affirmed his country's sovereignty and stated that Brazil would react by invoking its economic reciprocity law (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam, the four wealthiest individuals in Africa possess more wealth than the bottom 50% of the continent's population combined. The report highlights a dramatic increase in the number of African billionaires since 2000 and notes that the continent is home to nearly half of the world's most unequal countries. Oxfam argues that government policies, particularly ineffective tax systems, are biased against the poor and enable the super-rich to accumulate more wealth. This growing inequality is presented as a threat to democracy, poverty reduction, and climate action.</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans, poisoned by a severe toxic algal bloom, were released back into the wild in Huntington Beach after successful rehabilitation. The bloom, caused by high levels of domoic acid, was the deadliest such event in the region in nearly a decade, affecting numerous sea animals including sea lions. The pelicans were treated at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center, and their release symbolizes a moment of hope for local wildlife. The event highlights the growing environmental challenge posed by increasingly frequent and intense toxic algal blooms along the California coast.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth concerns. This decision comes as the central bank evaluates recent government measures designed to cool down Seoul's rapidly accelerating housing market, which saw prices spike over 19% in June. Authorities are particularly concerned about the rapid expansion of household debt, a significant portion of which is tied to the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system. The bank aims to stabilize the market without derailing the broader economy, which has faced challenges from softening exports (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Recent, back-to-back flooding events in New Mexico and Texas have yielded vastly different outcomes, underscoring the critical role of preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where floods were anticipated due to wildfire 'burn scars,' the community was ready and damage was mitigated, despite the tragic loss of three lives. In contrast, the ferocity of the Texas floods caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 119 deaths. Experts note that recent experience with a specific disaster type significantly informs a community's response, making them more likely to heed warnings and evacuate, a factor that appeared to be at play in New Mexico.</p>

This stance indicates that a permanent cessation of hostilities is contingent on Hamas's total disarmament.

Duffy takes over leadership at a critical time for NASA as it pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the Moon and undertaking the first human mission to Mars, while also facing significant proposed budget and staff cuts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that a 50% tariff on copper imports will be implemented on August 1, following a national security assessment. The administration justifies the tariff by citing copper's critical role in manufacturing for defense systems, semiconductors, and other key technologies. This move has caused a significant spike in U.S. copper prices and is expected to create a wide price gap between domestic and global markets. The U.S. imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, and experts suggest it will take years for domestic production to significantly increase in response to the new protectionist measure (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 senior-level positions at NASA, targeting employees with specialized skills and management experience. According to documents obtained by Politico, the move is part of a broader push to reduce the size of the federal government through buyouts and early retirements. This potential loss of decades of institutional knowledge comes as the agency faces a proposed 47% budget cut to its science activities for fiscal year 2026. Former NASA officials have warned these cuts could cede U.S. leadership in space exploration to competitors like China.</p>

          <p>As catastrophic floodwaters rose in Kerr County, Texas, some emergency alerts were reportedly delayed as dispatchers waited for supervisory approval.

A former county official who helped install the system confirmed that such alerts required authorization, which was not immediately given.

          <p>The United States has recorded 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest total since 1992 and surpassing the significant outbreak of 2019. The majority of infections are linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, which has seen over 750 cases and resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the highly contagious virus, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, to declining vaccination rates in certain communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the most effective protection against the disease.</p>

The unions had successfully argued in a lower court that the president exceeded his authority by ordering the cuts without congressional approval. The Supreme Court's majority stated the government was likely to succeed on the merits of its argument, allowing the contested workforce reductions to proceed.</p>
