          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a judge's ruling that Apple cannot prevent developers from using external links for payments. The game was previously removed in 2020 for circumventing Apple's commission fees. The ruling allows developers to avoid Apple's in-app purchase system, which takes a 15% to 30% cut. Amazon and Spotify have already updated their apps to take advantage of this change. Apple is appealing the ruling, and still has the option to reject Fortnite's resubmission, continuing the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested lowering tariffs on China from 145% to 80% ahead of trade negotiations. Analysts warn that even with the reduction, prices for consumers may not significantly decrease, and product shortages could still occur. The current high tariffs have already led to warnings from companies like Mattel about potential price increases. Uncertainty surrounding trade policy makes it difficult for businesses to adapt their supply chains effectively. An economics professor at Brigham Young University stated that an 80% tariff would still have a dramatic effect on consumers.</p>

The deal aims to reduce car tariffs to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if certain conditions are met.

          <p>Newly appointed German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made a swift inaugural visit to Brussels, emphasizing unity and support for trade deals, de-escalating tariff tensions with the U.S., curbing irregular migration, and strengthening Europe's defense. Merz stressed the need for more efficient defense spending and a pragmatic approach to joint procurement within NATO. However, his announcement of a "de facto entry ban" for migrants triggered concern across Europe. He also called for a swift ratification of the free trade agreement with the South American Mercosur bloc.</p>

          <p>Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary transit system in the San Francisco Bay Area, shut down all trains for several hours due to a computer networking issue. The outage affected all 50 stations and caused major delays for commuters. Riders sought alternative transportation, such as carpools, buses, and ferries. BART has struggled to regain ridership since the Covid-19 pandemic, with passenger traffic remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency assisted BART riders at certain stations during the shutdown.</p>

While the refugee program remains suspended for others, white South Africans have been processed much faster, raising concerns about politically motivated immigration policies. The administration will be relying on the Department of Health and Human Services to assist the Afrikaners.</p>

The minimum performances listed reflect the new standards for a passing score for 30-year-old combat soldiers.</p>

Discussions will likely cover U.S. semiconductor exports and Saudi Arabia's desire for its own civilian nuclear program.

The witness testified that she kept saying, “Please don’t, please stop, I don’t want this,’” but he didn’t listen during the sexual assault. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is already serving a 16-year sentence for a 2022 sexual-assault conviction in California.</p>

A witness statement from a safari camp official puts Mr. Moi in the area where the crime was committed at the time. The Met kept the statement hidden without fully investigating the claims. The Ward family believes that this is because of a cover-up orchestrated by the Foreign Office (FCDO) and involving the Met, to preserve good relations with Kenya. Jonathan Moi, who died in 2019, had previously denied rumours of his involvement in Julie’s murder, or being anywhere near the area where she was killed.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural nostalgia surrounding factory jobs in America, questioning whether the desire to bring them back aligns with the reality of American manufacturing today. Despite President Trump's promises, the manufacturing sector has declined significantly since its peak in 1979. Salaries for manufacturing jobs are now in the bottom half of all jobs. Automation and productivity growth have reduced the need for human labor in factories. Some argue that conservative views around traditional families and national security concerns contribute to the political appeal of bringing back factory jobs.</p>
