          <p>President Trump denied that bond market volatility influenced his decision to pause aggressive tariffs against U.S. trading partners. In a Time magazine interview, Trump stated the pause was to allow time for negotiation, not due to market concerns. He added that he would consider it a "total victory" even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now. Trump also mentioned that the bond market had gotten the "yips," but he remained confident in the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader poised to become Germany's chancellor, faces low popularity due to perceived untrustworthiness and unpopular stances. Merz broke promises on debt and passed a motion with AfD support, alienating voters. He is also unpopular among women due to past votes against recognizing sexual assault within marriage as a crime and his stance on gender-balanced cabinets. His hardline stance on Russia has also hurt his standing in eastern Germany, and his focus on immigration has not helped him shake off the AfD. </p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new carnivorous caterpillar species on Oahu, Hawaii, dubbed the "bone collector," that disguises itself by adorning its silk case with the remains of its prey, mostly insects captured in spiderwebs. Researchers believe this macabre practice serves as camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feed on the spider's meals without being detected. The species is rare, with only 62 individuals found in over 20 years, and its origins date back at least 6 million years. Scientists are urging conservation efforts to protect this unique lineage.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Rep. George Santos faces sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors are seeking 87 months in prison, citing his "wholly fictitious biography" used to enrich himself and defraud voters and donors. Santos has asked for leniency, accepting responsibility but claiming prosecutors are unfairly targeting him. He agreed to pay more than $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture as part of his plea deal, and has said he will request solitary confinement.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, known as a "dirty line." This line lacks the firewall protections of the Defense Department's classified and unclassified systems, potentially making it vulnerable to monitoring. Hegseth has denied sharing classified war plans over Signal, but the use of an unsecured line raises concerns about the security of sensitive communications. A DOD spokesperson initially declined to comment, citing classification, then later denied the report as "fake news."</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger, charged with the murders of four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty despite his autism diagnosis. Kohberger's attorneys argued that his autism reduces his culpability, but the judge stated that only an intellectual disability precludes the death penalty. The judge also ruled that jurors can hear much of the 911 call made by surviving roommates and see text messages sent around the time of the attack, assuming prosecutors lay the proper foundation.</p>

          <p>Analysts are increasingly concerned that Trump's economic policies, particularly the trade war, are jeopardizing the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The White House's confused policy aims and disregard for the rule of law are leading investors to dump American assets. The world's reliance on the dollar gives the U.S. an "exorbitant privilege," but this depends on trust in American financial institutions and governance, which Trump's policies are eroding. A sinking dollar could reduce families' purchasing power and weaken the U.S.'s international leverage.</p>
