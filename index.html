          <p>A shooting incident near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta resulted in a police officer being critically injured and the suspect's death. The suspect reportedly fired multiple rounds at the CDC building before being engaged by police at a nearby pharmacy. Authorities confirmed that no civilians were harmed, including 92 children at a daycare on the CDC campus at the time. The suspect died from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and the FBI is now investigating the event.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are grappling with a significant blow after star offensive tackle Rashawn Slater suffered a season-ending ruptured patellar tendon. Coach Jim Harbaugh described the loss as a "gut punch," expressing confidence in Slater's recovery but acknowledging the immediate challenge for the team. The injury forces a major reshuffle of the offensive line, with rookie Joe Alt moving to left tackle and other players stepping into new roles. The team is now exploring the free-agent market to add depth before the preseason continues.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic legislators, who broke quorum by leaving the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, have received support from California's leadership. Governor Gavin Newsom hosted the Texas lawmakers and vowed to potentially initiate a ballot measure to redraw California's own congressional map to "nullify" the GOP's actions in Texas. This move escalates a partisan battle, with Texas Republicans threatening legal action and withholding pay from the absent Democrats, who are determined to prevent the redrawing of five Democratic-held districts.</p>

The announcement comes as a White House deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire approaches, backed by the threat of secondary sanctions. The potential summit marks a significant diplomatic development, though the prospect of ceding territory is a politically fraught issue for Ukraine, which has been communicating with European leaders about the situation.</p>

Recent bans on adverts from major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S have ignited a debate about a potential resurgence of the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. While brands defend their models as healthy, the ASA has ruled that certain poses, lighting, and styling have made them appear unwell, raising concerns about regressing from the body positivity movement.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the negative psychological effects that hook-up apps like Grindr can have on some gay men. It features personal accounts from users who describe feeling objectified, developing addictive behaviors in pursuit of validation, and experiencing increased anxiety and depression. The piece suggests that for some, the culture of instant gratification and casual sexual encounters fostered by these apps can be toxic and leave them feeling empty and more isolated, rather than connected.</p>

          <p>The president of Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU), a joint venture in Suzhou, China, has identified geopolitics as the most significant threat to academic freedom and scientific research. President Xi Youmin stated that global division, driven by wars and trade conflicts, is increasingly permeating university life and pressuring institutions to make concessions. He proposed that easing visa restrictions for foreign students and visitors could be a way to foster better understanding of China and mitigate these challenges.</p>

          <p>In a major diplomatic achievement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially brokered by the United States under President Donald Trump. The deal aims to end nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. A central feature of the agreement is the creation of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, to be named after Trump, which will grant the U.S. exclusive development rights and is expected to boost regional exports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to occupy Gaza City, a move that is opposed by both the Israeli military establishment and a majority of the public. This analysis suggests Netanyahu's decision-making is primarily driven by the need to maintain the support of his narrow, hard-right coalition, which is essential for his political survival. This deference to a small, messianic minority over strategic advice and public opinion is prolonging the war and deepening the conflict.</p>

          <p>An Independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, admitted he mistakenly identified a charity rowing team off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post where he called for their deportation. After he alerted authorities, the vessel was confirmed to be a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease. Lowe later apologized for the false alarm and donated £1,000 to their cause, though he maintained his vigilance on immigration is necessary.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will lower the price cap for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil to $47.60 per barrel, down from the previous $60. This action aligns Canada with its G7 partners, including the European Union and the United Kingdom, who have also lowered the cap. The coordinated move is intended to further restrict Russia's oil revenues and increase economic pressure on Moscow over its continued war in Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>
