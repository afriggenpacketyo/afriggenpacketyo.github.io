        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant wildfire near the Mourne Mountains in County Down, Northern Ireland, is being treated as arson after it led to the evacuation of nearby homes. Over 100 firefighters battled the blaze, which stretched for approximately two miles and threatened local properties. The fire service believes the fire was started deliberately, prompting warnings for the public to remain vigilant given the amber wildfire warning issued for the weekend.  Silent Valley Mountain Park has been closed indefinitely due to the wildfires in the area.</p>

          <p>British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has announced a temporary pause in U.S. shipments as it assesses the impact of President Trump's newly implemented tariffs on vehicle imports. The move comes as the automotive industry grapples with disruption from the administration's sweeping tariff rollout. Jaguar Land Rover, a major British car manufacturer, considers the U.S. an important market and is developing mid- to longer-term plans to address the new trading terms. An escalating trade war is expected to significantly affect the global car industry due to its reliance on international supply chains.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing to advance plans for a $20-billion water tunnel in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta before his term ends, leading to escalating tensions. The State Water Resources Control Board is holding hearings on amending water rights permits to allow diversions from new points on the Sacramento River for the tunnel intakes. Supporters argue the project is vital for climate adaptation and protecting water supplies, while opponents claim it is an expensive boondoggle that would harm the environment and communities.

          <p>AstraZeneca's annual general meeting (AGM) is facing scrutiny over pay, investigations in China, and potential tariffs from the U.S. The company is under investigation in China for import and data breaches, and it recently abandoned plans to expand its vaccine site in the UK. Investors are also concerned about the possibility of Trump imposing tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. Despite these challenges, AstraZeneca reported strong financial results, with a 38% increase in profits and a confident prediction of $80 billion in revenues by 2030.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing significant challenges due to office closures, staffing and service cuts, and policy changes implemented by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge).

The SSA plans to eliminate thousands of jobs, and employees are being forced to take reassignments, while phone services are being cut and field offices are slated for closure.

          <p>Donald Trump has suggested he is "not joking" about seeking a third term as president, despite constitutional limits, raising concerns about the normalization of extremist ideas. While legal experts dismiss the possibility, Trump's comments follow a pattern of floating controversial ideas that gradually gain traction within the Republican party. Some Republicans are downplaying Trump's remarks, but others are pushing for constitutional changes to allow a third term. Democrats are countering these efforts by reaffirming support for the 22nd amendment, which limits presidents to two terms.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that the Trump administration's decision to move the federal student loan program to the Small Business Administration (SBA) could increase the risk of borrowers defaulting. The SBA lacks experience with student loans and is facing significant staff reductions, potentially leading to poor service and inadequate borrower protection. This move coincides with changes to borrower repayment plans and rising living costs, exacerbating the challenges for student loan borrowers. Some had expected the loan operation to move to the treasury department, which is better equipped to manage the complex system.</p>

          <p>Britain should not be cowed by Trump's tariff policies but instead seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond, according to an article.  The article argues that Trump's view of trade is flawed and that Britain should combine with other nations to sustain a rules-based global trading system. It suggests forming a privileged trade partnership with Canada and extending it to a newly relevant Commonwealth. The article also calls for increased defense spending and public investment to offset potential recession.</p>

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan ahead of a drill last week, a move analysts say was likely to be training to counter American warships nearby and to explore alternative routes in the event of a conflict over the island. Instead, the warship transited via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago, according to mainland Chinese and Taiwanese military experts.  Analysts said the new route could give the People’s Liberation Army alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, which is seen as a strategic chokepoint.</p>
