          <p>Eleven adult men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. One inmate, Kendell Myles, has been apprehended, but ten others, including Gary Price, who faces attempted first-degree murder charges, remain at large and are considered armed and dangerous. Authorities believe the inmates likely had assistance and have changed clothes, urging the public to remain alert but avoid panic, while emphasizing the seriousness of the escape and promising a thorough investigation into how it occurred and accountability for those involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home electricity bills in the U.S. are projected to hit a 12-year high this summer, averaging $784, a more than 6% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). This spike is attributed to rising electricity costs outpacing inflation and higher temperatures driving up cooling demand. Low-income families, who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy, may struggle to afford adequate cooling, potentially leading to health risks, with concerns that public assistance programs have not kept pace with the increasing frequency and duration of heat waves.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a significant setback when conservative Republicans on the House Budget Committee blocked it from advancing, citing insufficient federal spending cuts. Five Republicans voted against the legislation, demanding quicker implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients and deeper spending reductions, with one member changing his vote for procedural reasons. The bill, which aims to extend tax cuts and increase spending on military and border security, faces further hurdles as blue-state Republicans also seek changes to the cap on state and local tax deductions, highlighting the challenges in unifying the party behind the legislation.</p>

The recovery underscores the importance of staying invested during market volatility, as these stocks erased their losses and benefited from easing U.S.-China trade tensions and business deals announced during Trump's Mideast tour.

          <h2>Republican Tax Plan Could Harm Lower-Income Americans Despite Overall Tax Cuts, Analysis Shows</h2>

          <p>A new analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that while most Americans may see lower taxes under the Republican tax plan, some lower-income individuals could experience a decrease in after-tax income due to spending cuts. The report indicates that people making less than $51,000 a year could see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026, because they are factoring in both the tax cuts and the plan to pay for them by slashing federal spending on programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. The analysis highlights the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the potential for the poorest Americans to be disproportionately affected by the proposed changes.</p>

The fraud charge stems from Boeing's alleged misleading of regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes.</p>

          <p>While it is legally possible to stop paying credit cards, doing so can lead to serious financial and legal consequences, including damaged credit, collection activity, and potential lawsuits. Credit card debt is unsecured, meaning there's no collateral for the lender to seize, but creditors can still pursue legal avenues to recover unpaid balances. Before stopping payments, it's advisable to explore options like hardship programs, credit counseling, debt settlement, or bankruptcy to manage debt without long-term damage.
