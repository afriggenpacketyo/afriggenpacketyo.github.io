          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults, offers five simple parenting rules for raising smart and successful children. She advises parents to trust their instincts, follow their culture's child-rearing traditions, and pay attention to their child's individual interests. Ross emphasizes the importance of focusing on enjoyment rather than solely on development and encourages parents to be their real selves, not striving for an unattainable ideal. Her approach aims to reduce parental anxiety and promote a more intuitive and joyful parenting experience. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, has expressed concern over Iran's increasing stockpile of highly enriched uranium. According to a confidential report, Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a level close to weapons grade. The IAEA stated it could not confirm whether Iran's program remains peaceful. Israel accused Iran of being determined to acquire nuclear weapons, while Iran maintained its program is for peaceful purposes. The IAEA's assessment also detailed troubling findings about Iran's past nuclear activities. The optimism score is 25.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and witnessed the Earth from space before returning to land in West Texas. The New Shepard rocket reached an altitude of nearly 65 miles, just above the internationally recognized boundary of space. This marks Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight, having now launched 68 individuals into sub-orbital space. The company's competitor, Virgin Galactic, is expected to resume flights next year after upgrading its spacecraft. The optimism score is 85.</p>
