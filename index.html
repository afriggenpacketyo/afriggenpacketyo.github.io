          <p>An undocumented Honduran immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine for remaining in the U.S. after a 2005 removal order. ICE is charging her $500 for each day she has remained in the country since the order was issued. Her attorney argues she is eligible for U.S. residency and has three U.S. citizen children who would suffer if she were deported. The attorney has seen an uptick in ICE issuing fines to clients who remain in the country illegally and will appeal the fine, arguing her client was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S. once the removal order was issued.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The GDP data was worse than economists anticipated, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, offsetting domestic demand growth of 0.6%. While a weak yen provided a competitive edge, it was overpowered by China's machinery and tool exports. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain current rates, anticipating a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. to mitigate tariff impacts.</p>

Ventura testified these were "just words," and she sometimes initiated acts out of fear and to make Combs happy. She said the "freak-offs" were like a job she hated, especially when Combs recorded them, and if she refused, Combs would become violent.</p>

NJ Transit is encouraging people to work from home and has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service, but it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. The agency and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen have been at odds over pay raises, with the union arguing that competition pays more and the cost of living has increased.

The Supreme Court is weighing whether a single federal judge should dictate policy for the entire country. The analysis also shows that cases during Trump's second term have increasingly been landing before judges in Massachusetts, which is the bluest district in the circuit with the bluest appeals court.</p>

          <p>Green Tea Group had a tepid trading debut in Hong Kong on Friday, as traders sidestepped its small stock sale in anticipation of the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO) next week. Shares of the Hangzhou-based restaurant chain began trading unchanged from the offer price, before plunging 7 per cent in a declining market. Traders are looking forward to the trading debut on Tuesday of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world’s largest maker of battery packs for electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency told staff members that he believes President Donald Trump is a bold man with a bold vision for the agency -- but that FEMA doesn't yet have a full plan to tackle hurricane season. An internal document prepared for Richardson indicated the agency was ill-prepared for the upcoming hurricane season. Richardson said he and staff sat down for "about 90 minutes" and started to come up with a plan for this year's disaster season, and that the plan would be ready soon.</p>

The study did not highlight a specific reason for this increase, but the country is already grappling with a range of challenges caused by its rapidly ageing population and this trend threatens to compound the problem.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat from migrating whales, leading to experimental solutions like pop-up gear to reduce whale entanglements. Traditional crab fishing ropes have harmed hundreds of whales, prompting the state to shorten the season. Fisherman Brand Little uses a high-tech pop-up system that minimizes rope use and has not injured any whales. However, the cost of the new technology presents a challenge for many fishermen in an already struggling industry.</p>
