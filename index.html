          <p>Chinese robotics firms are rapidly expanding by leveraging mature supply chains and quick product iteration. Yarbo, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer, has gained attention for its hybrid snow-blowing and lawn-mowing robots designed to withstand extreme cold. The company raised US$3.45 million on Kickstarter and delivered its first 1,000 units. Custom low-temperature batteries and adaptive blades have helped Yarbo secure over 6,000 presale orders, demonstrating China's growing presence in the global robotics market. The article highlights China's ability to turn tech innovation into market presence and pricing power. </p>

          <p>Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander stated that Labour MPs are feeling despondent after Lord Mandelson's dismissal and Angela Rayner's resignation. Mandelson was dismissed due to newly surfaced information regarding his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, while Rayner's departure was mourned by many. The government is now searching for a new ambassador to the US just before President Trump's state visit. Some Labour MPs expressed anger at the handling of the Mandelson situation, while Conservatives have called for the publication of all vetting material. </p>

Their departure was initially delayed by the White House to assess their willingness to stay and train Americans. South Korea's president and Hyundai's CEO expressed concerns about the raid's impact on future investments. The South Korean foreign ministry has called for US Congressional support for a new visa for Korean firms, while Hyundai anticipates a factory opening delay of at least two months. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, with the largest contraction in manufacturing output for a year. The Office for National Statistics will now focus on growth over a rolling three-month period, which saw a 0.2% expansion. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure to boost economic growth ahead of the Autumn Budget. The service sector grew by 0.4%, but this was offset by a fall in output from the production sector, leading economists to anticipate a slowdown in the second half of 2025.

          <p>SK Hynix, a South Korean memory chipmaker, announced it is ready to mass produce its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips, positioning itself ahead of competitors. HBM is used in chipsets for AI computing, including Nvidia's chips, a major SK Hynix client. The company has completed internal validation and quality assurance for HBM4, which doubles bandwidth and increases power efficiency by 40% compared to the previous generation. HBM4 is expected to be the main AI memory chip for Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, reinforcing SK Hynix's key supplier status and driving its stock to its highest since 2000. </p>

          <p>Ros Atkins examines the principle of proportionality in international law concerning Israel's military operation in Gaza. International law requires that military responses be proportionate to the threat and that harm to civilians be balanced against military advantage. Experts largely agree that Israel's actions have been disproportionate due to civilian casualties, restricted access to food, and destruction of buildings. The article discusses the challenges of assessing proportionality and the ongoing debate over Israel's right to self-defense and its adherence to international law. </p>

          <h2>Report Finds Rising Costs and Poor Care in Children's Homes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 00:17:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Audit Office (NAO) reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, yet many children still receive inadequate care. Councils spent an average of £318,400 per child in children's homes in the year ending March 2024, but this expenditure does not represent value for money. The report attributes rising costs to a record number of children in care, their increasingly complex needs, and a profit-driven market. The NAO recommends greater oversight from the Department for Education. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks concluded their season with a 103-75 defeat to A'ja Wilson and the Las Vegas Aces, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2020. The Aces dominated with a WNBA regular-season record of 22 three-pointers, led by Jewell Loyd, Chelsea Gray, and Wilson. Despite efforts from Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum, the Sparks could not overcome the Aces' talent. Cameron Brink suffered a nose injury during the game and did not return, while rookies Sarah Ashlee Barker and Alissa Pili contributed in the loss. </p>

The Sun features a chilling picture of the suspect in the Kirk murder and laments the rise of political violence in the US. The Financial Times discusses potential replacements for Mandelson in Washington, including David Miliband. </p>

          <p>China has become the leading foreign investor in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, committing US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024. This investment accounts for 16% of the total in the cluster, second only to Thailand itself. Chinese investors are also involved in infrastructure projects, including a high-speed railway line. The railway project, initiated seven years ago and paused during the pandemic, is expected to take another five years to complete, showcasing China's growing economic influence in the region. </p>
