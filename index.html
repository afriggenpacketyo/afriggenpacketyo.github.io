          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit, where the Gaza peace plan is expected to be signed, marking a potential historic turning point after two years of conflict. Downing Street emphasized the UK's "key role" in shaping the plan, although this assertion was challenged by US Ambassador Mike Huckabee and Israel's deputy foreign minister, who credited President Trump. The summit, co-led by Trump and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, will gather over 20 world leaders to formalize the ceasefire, facilitate urgent humanitarian assistance into Gaza, and establish a foundation for lasting peace and security. Starmer is set to thank Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey for their efforts and urge continued coordination towards the truce's next phases.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance has issued a stark warning about impending "painful" job cuts if the government shutdown persists, now entering its third week, blaming Democrats for the impasse over health insurance subsidies. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are already on unpaid leave, with some initial layoffs at agencies like the CDC partially reversed due to errors. While essential workers continue without pay, the Trump administration has secured funds to pay military personnel, creating a notable exception. The stalemate has caused widespread disruption, including the closure of Smithsonian museums, and underscores the deep partisan divide preventing a resolution to the budget dispute.

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that Hamas might release the remaining 20 hostages "a little bit early" as he headed to the Middle East to oversee the peace deal. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump expressed satisfaction with the progress, calling the initial retrieval of captives "amazing" and noting his administration's involvement in the complex negotiations. His comments precede a Monday deadline for Hamas to return all remaining hostages to Israel, a crucial element of the peace agreement that brought an end to the two-year Israel-Hamas conflict. The president's visit highlights the intensive diplomatic efforts aimed at finalizing this significant phase of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Renowned mathematician Shing-Tung Yau shared his insights on what China needs to achieve global leadership in science, focusing on the crucial development of domestically groomed talent. He discussed the ongoing formulation of China's 15th five-year plan, suggesting its potential to overcome technology "choke points" amidst escalating tensions with the United States. Yau acknowledged China's substantial progress in manufacturing, largely attributing this success to its vast and competent skilled labor force, which allows it to effectively challenge the US in certain technological sectors. His perspective underscores the importance of internal capacity building for sustained scientific and industrial advancement.</p>

Both leaders envision Sino-Indian ties as a cornerstone of a multipolar world and a new Asian century, aiming to foster solidarity among developing countries.

Despite denying the claims, Danone will dedicate funds over the next three years to develop plastic-free alternatives for Evian in the US and will add a statement to its website about the limitations of plastic recycling.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump have held discussions regarding Ukraine's air defenses and the potential delivery of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Zelenskyy, whose country faces persistent Russian air attacks on its energy infrastructure, is actively seeking to enhance Ukraine's long-range precision strike capabilities, including additional ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles. Trump indicated he has "sort of made a decision" on providing Tomahawks but emphasized the need to understand how Kyiv would utilize them to avoid escalating the conflict. Meanwhile, Moscow has expressed "extreme concern" over the possible delivery, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko voiced doubts about Washington's commitment to supplying the missiles.</p>

          <p>Matt Cross from Lincolnshire, a first-time participant, has been crowned the overall World Conker Champion, triumphing over women's victor Mags Blake in the ultimate showdown. The 60th annual event, held in Southwick, Northamptonshire, drew 256 competitors from nine countries and featured heightened security measures, including "airport-style" scanners, in response to last year's cheating scandal involving a steel nut. Cross, 37, expressed his speechlessness at the unexpected win, attributing his success to "just force and accuracy" and the inherent element of chance in the game. Notably, one man was disqualified for attempting to introduce his own conker, underscoring the strict enforcement of competition rules.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which formalizes the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays, has ignited significant public debate. Tabloids sensationalized the move, claiming "extra holidays" for Muslims, a notion swiftly dismissed by legal and Islamic scholars as merely formalizing a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom. Germany's holiday regulations are typically state-specific and often rooted in Christian traditions. This agreement extends the same principle of unpaid leave for religious observance to Muslim holidays, aligning with existing state laws and promoting integration and equality within a diverse society.</p>

          <p>Penn State has announced the firing of head football coach James Franklin, effective Sunday, following a disastrous season collapse that extinguished the preseason No. 2 team's national title aspirations by early October. The decision came less than 24 hours after a 22-21 home loss to Northwestern, which also saw quarterback Drew Allar suffer a season-ending injury. Franklin, who compiled a 104-45 record over 11 seasons, notably struggled against top-10 opponents. The university now faces a substantial financial commitment, owing Franklin nearly $50 million in a contract buyout that extends until 2031, amidst a planned $700 million renovation to Beaver Stadium.

Eyewitnesses described widespread panic as dozens of families fled their homes under heavy gunfire, noting this time they were "running from their own people." The Hamas-run interior ministry asserted its forces were restoring order, while the Dughmush family alleged Hamas sought to evict them from a refuge building to establish a new base for its forces.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Ukrainian counteroffensive operations have achieved significant gains in both the southern Zaporizhzhia region and a crucial area of the Donetsk region. Zelenskyy reported an advance of over 3 kilometers in Zaporizhzhia near Orikhiv, with Ukrainian units successfully bringing the village of Mali Shcherbaky under their control. These recent successes follow weeks of reported advances around Dobropillia in Donetsk, a focal point of the conflict. While Russia's Defense Ministry did not acknowledge Ukrainian advances, it claimed to have struck Ukrainian troops in Zaporizhzhia. This news emerges amidst conflicting battlefield reports from both sides regarding the more than 3.5-year-old war.</p>

          <p>A Texas student, Megan Ashlee Davis, has spoken out after a fabricated social media post, featuring her real mugshot, falsely claimed she was an Olive Garden waitress arrested for throwing breadsticks at customers. The viral hoax, which generated significant backlash, has become Davis's "worst nightmare," ruining her life with inappropriate comments and AI-generated content. Her mugshot stemmed from an August arrest for public intoxication, occurring weeks after her mother's death. Despite Olive Garden's denial of her employment, copies of the un-fact-checked post continue to circulate, highlighting the damaging effects of online misinformation, especially since Meta stopped third-party fact-checking in the US.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance confirmed that President Donald Trump is "looking at all options," including invoking the Insurrection Act, to deploy military troops on US soil for domestic unrest. This consideration comes amidst legal challenges to federal deployments in cities like Chicago, where courts have blocked the administration's efforts. Vance justified these considerations by citing "out of control" crime rates in cities, though violent crime has been falling. The Insurrection Act, rarely used since the 1960s, allows presidential deployment of military forces in cases of insurrection. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker vehemently opposed these threats, accusing Vance of "tidal wave of lies" and asserting he would stand up for the law.</p>

Residents gathered for a candlelit vigil, sharing their grief and memories of lost family, friends, and coworkers in the small, rural town. After nearly two days with no sign of survivors, authorities have tragically shifted from rescue to recovery efforts, with rapid DNA analysis ongoing to identify remains. The cause of the explosion remains unknown, and federal investigators from the ATF anticipate it could take up to a month to safely access the main site due due to the volatile materials, which also necessitate controlled detonations to secure the area.</p>

          <p>China has strongly accused the US of "double standards" following President Donald Trump's threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, warning of unspecified "countermeasures." A commerce ministry spokesperson asserted that China is "not afraid" of a trade war, criticizing US export restrictions on chips and semiconductors while defending its own rare earths controls as legitimate national security measures. Trump initially escalated tensions, labeling China "very hostile," but later softened his stance, suggesting everything "will be fine." These diplomatic exchanges have unsettled financial markets, rekindling fears of a trade conflict despite a previous agreement to drop triple-digit tariffs, and are widely interpreted as strategic positioning ahead of potential future trade negotiations.
