          <p>Starbucks is exploring options for its China business, including a possible stake sale, as growth in the region stalls due to macroeconomic pressures and increased competition from local players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee. The coffee chain has contacted private equity firms and technology companies to gauge interest in the assets, which could be valued at several billion dollars. Starbucks currently operates over 7,750 stores in China and generated approximately $740 million in net revenue during the quarter ending in March, while Luckin's net revenue was $1.2 billion in the same period. The company may decide not to proceed with a deal, but is expected to submit initial feedback soon.</p>

          <p>A Gloucester Township, New Jersey couple, Branndon Mosley and Brenda Spencer, have been arrested and charged with multiple offenses including kidnapping and sexual assault after allegedly abusing and confining a child in their home for years. The victim, now 18, escaped with help from a neighbor and reported the abuse, which reportedly began around 2018 when Spencer took them out of school. The victim stated they were forced to live in a dog crate and a padlocked bathroom, and were sexually abused by Mosley, the stepfather.

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with President Trump's "one, big beautiful bill," a major budget package addressing defense, energy, and tax priorities, despite internal divisions. Three committees have voted to advance contentious parts of the bill, but Republicans remain divided on issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT), Medicaid, and food stamp changes. The Ways and Means Committee advanced the tax portions after nearly 18 hours of debate, while the Energy and Commerce Committee addressed Medicaid cuts, including work requirements. The Agriculture Committee also voted on food stamp changes, increasing the age requirement for able-bodied adults. The House aims for a vote next week, but the Senate still needs to weigh in.</p>

          <p>Mexican officials reported that 17 family members of drug cartel leaders, including the former wife of Ovidio Guzmán López, crossed into the United States as part of an apparent deal between Guzmán López and the Trump administration. Guzmán López, son of "El Chapo" Guzmán, was extradited to the U.S. in 2023. The Mexican Security Secretary suggested that the family's entry was due to negotiations with the U.S. Department of Justice. This confirmation coincided with the U.S. Attorney General's office charging top cartel leaders with "narcoterrorism."</p>

The T-4 jet disappeared from radar shortly after departing Komaki Air Base, and the investigation may face difficulties as the aircraft had no flight recorder.

The votes, taken in three key committees, are a crucial step towards what Trump calls the “big beautiful bill,” which Republicans aim to pass in the House by the end of next week. The measure would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cut and enact his campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, with cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies offsetting the costs. However, the plan faces dissent from conservative lawmakers and Republicans from high-tax states, as well as opposition in the Senate.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation by British maritime authorities determined that the Bayesian superyacht, which capsized off Sicily last year killing seven people, was likely overturned by an intense gust of wind due to its towering single mast. The report noted that the yacht's signature feature increased its vulnerability to capsizing in high winds, and the young deckhand on watch delayed waking up the captain. The report also stated that once the yacht heeled beyond 70 degrees, the situation became irrecoverable. The yacht's operating manual lacked critical data about its instability in high winds, and its angle of vanishing stability was lower than many sailboats.</p>

Newsom announced that the state faces an additional $12-billion budget shortfall next year, necessitating cuts in healthcare for low-income undocumented immigrants and reduced overtime for government employees.

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been freed from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his rights to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested by immigration agents in March, with authorities accusing him of spreading Hamas propaganda. The judge refuted claims that Suri had ties to Hamas through his wife, whose father was a government official in Gaza. The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings, and several students and academics have been investigated for allegedly advocating violence and terrorism.</p>

          <p>China-Philippine ties face a reckoning after President Marcos' efforts to diminish the Duterte camp's influence fell short, potentially paving the way for improved relations if Duterte succeeds in the 2028 presidential election. Observers noted that Duterte, likely to survive an impeachment trial, could become a formidable candidate with her "pragmatic" stance on China. Preliminary results showed that Marcos' allies secured fewer Senate seats than expected, while Duterte's allies are poised to claim enough seats to shield her from conviction. A professor at Fudan University said Marcos had failed to eliminate the Duterte political dynasty's grip on power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's increasingly hostile approach to South Africa, including welcoming white Afrikaner refugees and halting foreign aid, is rooted in the president's long-held concerns about the treatment of white farmers. Influenced by conversations with Afrikaner activists and golfer Gary Player, Trump believes white South Africans are facing persecution and land seizures. The administration's policies also reflect a broader focus on eradicating diversity and inclusion programs and a growing rift between the two countries over Israel's war in Gaza. Despite evidence to the contrary, Trump has perpetuated the narrative of a "genocide" against white farmers, leading to diplomatic tensions and controversial policy decisions.</p>

Trump stated that he didn't know if Putin would attend without him, but that Rubio would be very effective.

          <p>Following an offer by President Trump to resettle Afrikaner refugees escaping alleged government-sponsored discrimination, white South Africans are divided on whether to leave their home country. While some Afrikaners, like Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, remain committed to contributing to South Africa's success, others, like Ilse Steenkamp, have applied for the refugee program due to experiencing crime and land invasions. The US embassy has clarified that the offer applies to Afrikaners or racial minorities of South African nationality who can cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future. Critics argue that Afrikaners are not genuine refugees, while supporters claim they face systemic oppression.</p>

Dong, an economics graduate, entered medicine through Peking Union Medical College’s “4+4” program, bypassing the traditional 10-year medical education route.

The revival of the thrusters, which had been out of action since 2004, ensures that the spacecraft can maintain its orientation and continue sending back data. The engineers took a risk by switching Voyager 1 to its primary roll thrusters and turning them on before attempting to fix and restart the heaters. This success ensures that Voyager 1 can continue operating until it's able to contact home again next year.</p>

The Republican-controlled legislature approved a measure that would ask voters to ban abortion again, except in medical emergencies or in cases of rape or incest reported within 48 hours. The question will appear on the ballot in November 2026, although the governor could call a special election sooner. The move defies the trend of voters siding with abortion rights in recent ballot measures, and opponents of abortion rights have grown wary of putting the question before voters.</p>
