          <p>Labour MP Dan Norris, representing North East Somerset and Hanham, was arrested on suspicion of rape, child sex offenses, child abduction, and misconduct in public office following a referral regarding alleged non-recent child sex offenses. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed the arrest of a man in his 60s, who was later released on conditional bail as investigations continue, with the alleged offenses dating back to the 2000s and including a rape allegation from the 2020s. The Labour Party has immediately suspended Norris, who previously served as a junior minister and Mayor of the West of England, pending the outcome of the police investigation, meaning he is also unable to sit as a Labour MP in the Commons.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Zoo announced the successful hatching of four Galapagos tortoises, marking the first time in its 150-year history that these critically endangered reptiles have been born at the zoo. The hatchlings are offspring of Mommy and Abrazzo, the zoo's oldest residents, both nearly 100 years old. These tortoises are being closely monitored and are thriving behind the scenes in the Reptile and Amphibian House, with a public debut planned for April 23. Mommy is considered one of the most genetically valuable Galapagos tortoises, and these hatchlings represent a significant step in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' species survival plan.</p>

          <p>The IRS is planning to cut up to 25% of its workforce, beginning with the elimination of its Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, according to an internal email. The agency cites increased efficiency as the reason for the reduction, which will be implemented in phases and include early retirement incentives.

Critics argue that such content reinforces conservative ideas, placing men at the center of the universe and promoting an unattainable ideal of physical perfection and success-obsessed individualism.

          <p>Economists are questioning the formula behind President Trump's tariff announcement, stating that it is based on flawed assumptions and results in inflated tariff rates. The formula, which calculates tariff rates based on a nation's trade deficit with the U.S., divided by its exports, then divided by two, assumes an elasticity rate lower than it should be in practice. Adjusting the elasticity assumptions would result in significantly lower tariff rates, with most countries being at the baseline of 10%. A report from the Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than they are in reality.</p>

While stocking up on some items may seem logical, economists warn that the tariffs are expected to increase prices for everyday items and could potentially lead to a recession. Experts advise consumers to take a measured approach and consider their long-term financial situation and goals, avoiding panic buying and unnecessary debt.

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has dismissed his deputy, Shahram Dabiri, for taking a "lavish" trip to Antarctica with his wife during Nowruz, the Persian New Year. The President's office cited Iran's ongoing economic challenges, stating the trip was unjustifiable. A picture of Dabiri and his wife in front of the MV Plancius, bound for Antarctica, sparked outrage in Iran. Pezeshkian emphasized the importance of simplicity for those in positions of authority, especially given the economic pressures on the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has cautioned that the Republican Party risks a "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if President Trump's tariffs lead to a recession. Cruz expressed concern that the tariffs, if prolonged and met with global retaliation, could trigger a trade war that would damage the U.S. economy. He emphasized that retaliatory tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession, leading to a Democratic House and possibly a Democratic Senate.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza City allegedly killed at least 31 Palestinians, including numerous children, according to medics in the Hamas-ruled enclave. The Israeli military claims it targeted a "Hamas command and control center" in the area and took steps to lessen harm to civilians, but provided no immediate evidence to support the claim. The strikes occurred amid intensified military operations and evacuation orders in northern Gaza, leading to widespread displacement and shortages of essential supplies.</p>

          <p>Michigan and 18 other states have filed a lawsuit against President Trump's executive order regarding elections, arguing that it is an unconstitutional invasion of states' authority to run their own elections. The lawsuit seeks to block key aspects of the order, including requirements for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and the demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. State attorneys general argue that the President lacks the power to control state voting laws, which are enshrined in state constitutions.</p>

          <h2>Experts Critique Trump's Tariff Formula as Misrepresenting Global Trade Economics</h2>

          <p>Economic experts are criticizing President Trump's tariff formula, stating that it misrepresents global trade economics and is based on misleading calculations. The formula, which calculates tariffs based on a nation's trade deficit with the U.S. divided by its imports, is not aligned with modern definitions of trade deficits. Experts argue that the formula is unlikely to yield the results the administration is seeking and that it deviates from established rules of trade policies followed by most industrial countries since World War II.</p>
