        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Wall Street Journal report indicates that the Pentagon has been quietly blocking Ukraine from using US-made long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to strike targets inside Russia. This policy represents a significant limitation on Kyiv's ability to deploy powerful weaponry in its defense against Moscow's invasion. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly has the final say on the use of these and other US-supplied or US-intelligence-reliant European weapons. This development occurs as US President Donald Trump expresses growing frustration over the prolonged conflict and the stalled peace process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new fitness trend on TikTok, the "6-6-6" walking routine, is gaining traction for its fat-burning benefits without requiring intense workouts. The method involves a six-minute warm-up, a 60-minute brisk walk, and a six-minute cooldown, often performed at 6 AM or 6 PM. Experts like celebrity personal trainer Kollins Ezekh emphasize walking as an overlooked exercise for stress reduction and consistency. This low-intensity approach aligns with Zone 2 training, burning approximately 65% of calories from fat, and is seen as a sustainable starting point for a more active lifestyle.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone, aiming to boost tourism, with Russian groups being the first international visitors. Anastasia Samsonova, a Russian tourist, described a tightly controlled visit, accompanied by guards and a fixed itinerary, on almost-empty, pristine beaches. The resort, inspired by Spain's Benidorm, has faced criticism from human rights groups over alleged forced labor during its construction. Despite restrictions and high costs, Samsonova enjoyed the unique experience, though future Russian tours are uncertain.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its 33rd resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) early Sunday, sending a Dragon capsule with 2.5 tons of equipment and supplies. A key addition is an add-on thruster kit, featuring Draco engines, designed to help maintain the ISS's altitude by counteracting atmospheric drag, a task largely handled by Russia previously. This boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed annually, with the first burn planned for September 3. The mission also delivers 50 research projects, including studies on bone loss, 3D metal printing, and bioprinting for nerve regeneration.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has ordered the evacuation of over 586,000 people from central provinces as Typhoon Kajiki, with winds of 166km/h, approaches and is expected to strengthen before making landfall on Monday. Flights have been cancelled and boats ordered ashore, with authorities urging residents to stay indoors after Sunday afternoon. The storm is predicted to weaken inland but still bring winds of 200km/h and significant rainfall, alongside storm surges of 2-4 meters. Officials fear it could be as devastating as Typhoon Yagi in 2024, which caused hundreds of deaths.</p>

          <p>Three young sisters, aged nine, 11, and 17, drowned in a dangerously overcrowded rubber boat carrying migrants across the central Mediterranean, according to German rescue charity RESQSHIP. The vessel, which departed from Libya, began taking on water in rough seas, leading to panic and the tragic deaths. Approximately 65 people, including the sisters' mother and brother, were rescued, many suffering severe chemical burns from mixed seawater and petrol. This incident adds to the over 700 deaths reported this year in the treacherous crossing from North Africa.</p>

          <p>US sanctions against China's nuclear power industry, including blacklisting China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) and suspending equipment licenses, have reportedly backfired. Instead of hindering, these measures have inadvertently spurred China's advanced capabilities and industrial scale, making its nuclear sector an "unattainable benchmark" of efficiency. As Western nations struggle with delays and supply chain issues in their own nuclear expansions, China's exclusion from global cooperation now threatens to impede the West's atomic energy revival. Experts advocate for balancing global cooperation with local participation in the nuclear supply chain.</p>

          <p>Despite China's "charm offensive" on trade, aimed at countering American pressure, US allies are largely resisting meaningful political alignment with Beijing. The article argues that centuries of shared identity, security integration, and cultural allegiance bind these nations irreversibly to Washington's strategic architecture. While economic ties with China remain significant, foundational security priorities, including US intelligence-sharing pacts and defense commitments, remain paramount for these allies. This indicates a persistent gap between China's global economic ambitions and the geopolitical realities of its relationships with Western-aligned countries.</p>

          <p>Amid market uncertainties, top Wall Street analysts are recommending three dividend-paying stocks—MPLX LP, EOG Resources, and Home Depot—for investors seeking steady returns. MPLX LP, a midstream energy company, offers a 7.5% yield and is expected to grow distributions. Oil and gas producer EOG Resources, with a 3.4% yield, is bolstering its position in Utica shale and focusing on shareholder returns. Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, yields 2.2% and shows improving underlying trends despite market challenges. Analysts highlight these companies' strong fundamentals and ability to navigate economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.7%, up from an earlier estimate of 2.1%, driven by recent increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). While a higher COLA means more money for retirees, the Senior Citizens League (SCL) warns that these adjustments often lag behind actual inflation, causing a long-term erosion of purchasing power.

          <p>The UK government plans to overhaul its asylum appeals system to reduce delays and reliance on hotels for migrants awaiting rulings. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite appeals, which currently take over a year to process, leaving 51,000 cases pending. The Refugee Council, however, argues that reducing mistakes in initial decisions is the fastest way to cut the appeals backlog, noting about half of original decisions are overturned. This initiative comes amidst rising public frustration and protests over the use of asylum hotels.</p>

The ongoing Louisiana lawsuit against the Jesuit order highlights the church's historical struggles with clergy sexual assault. Arrupe's cause for canonization, which opened in 2019, is now under scrutiny due to his alleged inaction in this case.</p>

This move, while seen as a political gamble, aims to challenge Trump's power grabs and could significantly impact the 2028 presidential race.
