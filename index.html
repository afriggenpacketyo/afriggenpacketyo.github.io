          <h2>Japan Grapples with 'Toilet Panic' Preparedness Following Noto Peninsula Earthquake</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the devastating Noto Peninsula earthquake, Japan is facing scrutiny over its preparedness for maintaining sanitary toilet facilities during disasters, as damaged sewage systems led to unsanitary conditions and a phenomenon known as 'toilet panic.' The article highlights that while necessities like food and water are prioritized, the importance of functional toilets is often overlooked, leading to potential health crises. Many people are unfamiliar with using portable toilets, exacerbating the problem, thus educators are beginning to teach children about their use in emergency situations. Experts urge people to stockpile portable toilets at home and workplaces to ensure sanitation in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, as it can take weeks to install temporary toilets. These measures aim to prevent the spread of disease and ensure people do not avoid using the toilet due to unhygienic conditions.</p>

          <p>Large-scale protests erupted across Los Angeles following an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation that led to numerous arrests, prompting President Trump to threaten federal intervention. Trump criticized California's Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Bass, claiming they were unable to manage the situation and threatening to deploy the National Guard. Newsom responded by accusing the federal government of intentionally escalating tensions and deploying additional California Highway Patrol units. The protests included blocking streets, setting fires, and clashes between protesters and authorities, leading to multiple arrests and injuries. The demonstrations stemmed from ICE raids in several Los Angeles districts, with officials confirming dozens of arrests related to harboring undocumented individuals, leading to condemnation from local leaders and promises of resistance. Optimism for de-escalation is low given the strong stances from both sides.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. Venture capitalists have sparked debate by suggesting that European companies need to embrace overwork to compete globally, but many founders argue that this approach is unsustainable and detrimental to employee well-being. They emphasize that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through innovation and a focus on sustainable work cultures rather than excessive hours. Founders also contend that Europe needs more funding and resources to support its startups, enabling them to hire enough talent and avoid burnout. The discussion highlights the clash between different work philosophies and the importance of work-life balance in the European tech scene.</p>

De Kai argues that AI should not be viewed as a technological arms race but as a change to the social climate, akin to climate change. In his book, 'Raising AI,' he advocates for treating AI as children that learn from their environment, emphasizing the importance of being conscientious about the data and interactions AI systems are exposed to.

          <p>Italy is deeply divided over a referendum proposing to halve the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, aligning the country with most of Europe. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and urging Italians to abstain from voting. The reform aims to expedite citizenship for legal foreign residents who contribute to Italy's economy and society, potentially benefiting up to 1.4 million people. Supporters argue that it would integrate long-term residents, while opponents claim it undermines Italian identity. The debate highlights the sensitive issue of immigration and national identity in Italy.</p>

This initiative is part of Prime Minister Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional economies and reverse the trend of people moving to major cities like Tokyo. The system would involve registering via a smartphone app and receiving certificates, providing users with information on local events and services. While the program aims to attract tourists and those who donate through the hometown tax system, some officials are skeptical about its ability to foster regional growth.</p>

The decision by Sovereignty's connections to skip the Preakness Stakes paid off, allowing the horse to secure a decisive victory in the Belmont. The race, held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations, saw Journalism finish second and Baeza third, repeating the Derby's top three. Despite the absence of a Triple Crown on the line, the race provided a compelling narrative and helped rejuvenate interest in horse racing, marking the first time in 22 Triple Crown races that there was a repeat Triple Crown race winner.</p>

          <p>An ancient writing system from Zambia, Sona or Tusona, is being highlighted through the Women's History Museum of Zambia's social media project, challenging the notion that African societies lacked their own knowledge systems. Sona, used by the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, involves geometric patterns that carry mathematical principles, messages about nature, and instructions on community life. The original custodians of Sona were women, and the project aims to revive and document this cultural heritage that was nearly erased by colonialism. The project showcases various Zambian artifacts collected during the colonial era, revealing the significant roles women played in pre-colonial communities.</p>
