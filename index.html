          <h2>Trump Administration Issues Executive Order Targeting College Sports Revenue and NIL Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 20:24:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating the evolving landscape of college sports, specifically Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to ban "third-party, pay-for-play payments" while preserving athletes' rights to brand endorsements and ensuring revenue-sharing plans support women's and non-revenue sports. It also directs universities with high athletic revenues to maintain or increase scholarship opportunities for sports that generate less income. The move attempts to introduce federal guardrails into what the White House described as an "out-of-control" system, addressing concerns about competitive balance and the preservation of non-revenue athletic programs.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Governors Reportedly Consider Leaving National Governors Association Over Trump Disputes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 20:22:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is reportedly leading an effort among Democratic governors to potentially withdraw from the bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA). The frustration stems from a belief that the NGA has not adequately pushed back against the Trump administration's perceived overreaches on states' rights, such as the deployment of the National Guard and clashes over federal funding. While no governor has publicly confirmed their departure, sources indicate at least two are considering not paying their dues. The NGA maintains its commitment to bipartisan consensus, while some insiders suggest the controversy is a product of internal Democratic power struggles ahead of future elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted an extensive interview with Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, concerning her association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, reportedly answered all questions without declining. The meeting marks the first time the Department of Justice has formally questioned Maxwell since her conviction, coming amid mounting pressure on the Trump administration to release more information from the Epstein investigation. This development occurs as the House Oversight Committee also subpoenas Maxwell for a deposition, signaling intensified efforts to uncover more details about Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will formally recognize the State of Palestine in September at the UN General Assembly. This decision aligns with France's historical commitment to a two-state solution and follows similar moves by other European nations like Spain and Ireland. The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials but condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated the move "rewards terror." The decision comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and international pressure for a ceasefire and a lasting peace settlement in the region.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested while in costume for allegedly stealing and using a customer's debit card.

Police confronted the man, Jermel Jarreau Jones, during his shift and escorted him out of the establishment in the full mouse costume. The stolen debit card was allegedly found in his pocket, and he faces felony charges for larceny and fraudulent use of the card.</p>

          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, Donald Trump and Chairman Jerome Powell engaged in a tense, public dispute over the cost of the central bank's building renovations. President Trump claimed the project was over budget at $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately contested, stating the president was including a separate, older building in his calculation. The confrontation, captured on camera, highlights Trump's escalating pressure on Powell, whom he has frequently criticized for not lowering interest rates more quickly. The spat over construction costs appears to be another front in the president's ongoing campaign against the Fed's independence.</p>

These potential candidates are also adopting more moderate rhetoric on sensitive cultural topics, such as gender identity, in what appears to be a course correction following the 2024 election loss.

Citing Alphabet's recent decision to increase capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and necessary for future profitability.

          <p>The nightly pop culture show “E! News” is being canceled, with its final episode scheduled to air on September 25 after a run of more than three decades. Staff were informed that the decision was driven by a shift in audience preference towards consuming breaking entertainment news on social media throughout the day rather than a scheduled nightly broadcast. The cancellation will result in about 20 job eliminations. While the linear show is ending, E!'s news operation will continue its robust online presence and maintain its popular live coverage of red carpet events like the Oscars.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is positioned for a significant contract extension next offseason, following the trend of young NFL receivers securing lucrative deals. After two standout seasons, the former fifth-round draft pick will earn just over $1 million this year, making him one of the best bargains in the league. With veteran Cooper Kupp's departure and the arrival of Davante Adams, Nacua has ascended to the role of the team's top receiver. If he maintains his high level of production in the upcoming season, he could command a nine-figure contract in 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at empowering local governments to clear unhoused people from public streets and spaces. The order seeks to reverse judicial precedents that limit officials' ability to compel individuals into mental health treatment and other long-term institutional settings to "restore public order." The move comes as homelessness reaches record highs in the U.S. and follows a Supreme Court ruling that allows cities to penalize people for sleeping outside. Critics and advocacy groups condemned the order, arguing that it criminalizes homelessness and will worsen the crisis without addressing its root cause: a lack of affordable housing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis examines why the Biden administration did not release the complete Jeffrey Epstein files, despite their potential to contain damaging information about Donald Trump. The article suggests several factors, including the legal barriers to releasing secret grand jury testimony, which requires a judge to find an exceptional public interest. Furthermore, appearing in the files does not inherently imply wrongdoing, and the FBI rarely releases investigative material that doesn't lead to criminal charges to protect privacy. Therefore, even if the Biden administration had wanted to release the documents for political reasons, it likely would have been unable to do so without court approval, a hurdle Trump's own administration is now facing.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis connects the FCC's approval of the Skydance-Paramount merger to a series of concessions made to the Trump administration. The report highlights how Paramount's $16 million settlement of a Trump lawsuit, Skydance's promise to eliminate DEI programs, and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show created a favorable environment for the deal's approval. The article notes that Skydance CEO David Ellison's father, Larry Ellison, is bankrolling the deal and is a known Trump ally. Critics argue these actions create a chilling effect on media organizations, demonstrating the administration's power to pressure companies with pending regulatory decisions.</p>
