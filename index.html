          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices. This plan aims to tie the prices of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Trump administration previously attempted to implement this idea during Mr. Trump's first term, but court orders blocked the proposal. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning, pointing to higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic.</p>
