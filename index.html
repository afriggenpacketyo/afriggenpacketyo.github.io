        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A White House meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy focused on pathways to a peace deal with Russia. Key topics included the potential for a trilateral summit with Vladimir Putin and the provision of U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine. The meeting, which was also attended by seven European leaders, was notably more cordial than a previous encounter. However, Trump signaled a shift away from demanding an immediate ceasefire, a position that created some tension with the European contingent who view it as a crucial first step for negotiations.</p>

Zeta-Jones also shared her passion for fashion, particularly her extensive collection of Fendi Baguette bags, and reminisced about her fond relationship with her late father-in-law, Kirk Douglas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump announced his intention to issue an executive order to ban mail-in ballots and certain voting machines, claiming they are corrupt. However, legal experts interviewed for the article explain that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to regulate federal elections. Experts also noted significant logistical hurdles and the likelihood of legal challenges, making such a ban highly improbable to implement before the 2026 midterm elections. The move is seen by some as an effort to undermine confidence in the electoral process.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that numerous women are effectively trapped in Afghanistan's largest women's mental health center, often abandoned by their families and with no legal or social means to live independently. Many patients, who are victims of domestic abuse or have been cast out by their families, are medically ready for discharge but have nowhere to go due to the Taliban's severe restrictions on women's rights. The facility is overcrowded and struggling to cope with rising demand, reflecting a broader mental health crisis exacerbated by years of conflict and the current oppressive regime.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, known as the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges, including distribution of ketamine resulting in the death of actor Matthew Perry. She is the last of five individuals charged in connection with Perry's October 2023 overdose to reach a plea deal. The U.S. Attorney's Office stated Sangha supplied the fatal dose through intermediaries, and she also admitted to selling ketamine linked to another overdose death in 2019. Sangha faces decades in prison for the charges.</p>

          <p>Leeds secured a 1-0 victory against Everton in their Premier League return, thanks to a contentious penalty decision that has sparked debate over handball rules.

          <h2>Hamas Reportedly Agrees to Latest Ceasefire and Hostage Release Proposal</h2>

          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is said to involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with further negotiations on a permanent ceasefire to follow. Israel's official response remains unclear, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously insisted on the release of all hostages at once. The development comes amid intensified Israeli military operations in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>As "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services grow in popularity, so do defaults, raising questions about debt relief options. The article explains that because BNPL plans are a form of unsecured debt, they can potentially be included in debt forgiveness programs, similar to credit card debt. However, eligibility can vary, as some BNPL providers may not negotiate settlements and instead send delinquent accounts directly to collectors. For consumers struggling with BNPL debt, other strategies like direct negotiation with the provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling may also be effective alternatives.

          <p>The Polari Prize, a prominent UK award for LGBTQ+ literature, has been canceled for the year following a major controversy. The dispute arose after author John Boyne was longlisted for his novel; Boyne had recently written an article defending J.K. Rowling and using the term "TERF," prompting numerous other nominated authors and a judge to withdraw in protest. After more than 800 publishing figures signed an open letter criticizing the nomination, organizers decided to pause the prize to review its governance and increase trans representation on its judging panels.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, President Trump stated that a ceasefire is not a necessary precondition for a peace deal with Russia. This marks a reversal from his position just a week prior and creates a point of contention with European allies, who strongly advocate for a halt in fighting before negotiations proceed. While Trump did suggest the U.S. would help provide security guarantees for Ukraine, he emphasized that European nations would be expected to bear most of the responsibility for ensuring a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin fell to around $115,000 after reaching a new all-time high of over $124,000 last week, part of a wider downturn in the cryptocurrency market. The sell-off was reportedly triggered by macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected inflation data that has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The price drop led to over $500 million in forced liquidations of long positions across the crypto market, with Ether and other major digital assets also experiencing significant declines.

          <p>Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX, suffered a brief but widespread network outage on Monday, with thousands of users reporting service interruptions.

          <p>This analysis piece observes that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy adopted a more cautious and collegial approach during his recent White House meeting with President Trump, a stark contrast to their acrimonious encounter in February. Joined by several European leaders who seemed to be running interference, Zelenskyy largely avoided confrontation while Trump boasted of his peacemaking abilities. While few concrete details of a peace plan emerged, the meeting was notable for its lack of overt conflict, suggesting all sides were keen to project a unified front and shift the onus for peace back onto Russia.</p>
