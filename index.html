            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people, including three passengers and the driver, prompting an investigation by prosecutors. The incident occurred when a cable supporting the cabin snapped near the top of Mount Faito. Emergency services rescued other passengers from a second cabin, while one person was seriously injured and airlifted to the hospital. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed condolences, and the company operating the cable car service called the tragedy "unimaginable."</p>

            <p>Director James Cameron, known for films like "The Terminator," has shifted his perspective on artificial intelligence, now viewing it as a tool to reduce VFX costs and speed up production in Hollywood. He joined Stability AI's board to understand AI development and integrate it into VFX workflows. Cameron believes AI can automate tasks like rotoscoping, allowing artists to focus on more creative aspects. While he once warned about AI weaponization, he now sees its potential to enhance filmmaking, emphasizing the need for ethical management and copyright protection.</p>

            <p>An international graduate student from UCLA was detained at the U.S.-Mexico border by Customs and Border Protection, prompting a campus rally in support. This incident follows the Trump administration's cancellation of over 1,000 foreign student visas, including some at UCLA. While the reasons for the student's detention are unclear, it raises concerns about immigration enforcement actions targeting international students. The administration has cited national security concerns and alleged support for terrorist groups as justification for visa cancellations, though attorneys for students claim minor infractions are also being used.</p>

            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China has missed several key targets in its "Made in China 2025" plan, which aimed for technological self-sufficiency. While the country has achieved domestic dominance in autos, it has fallen short in aerospace, high-end robots, and manufacturing value-added growth. The plan, initially met with international criticism, has also fostered unhealthy industrial competition. The U.S. has responded with restrictions on China's access to high-end tech and incentives for domestic manufacturing.</p>

            <p>The U.S. administration is planning to impose port fees on Chinese ships in an effort to revive shipbuilding in the U.S. and challenge China's dominance in the industry. The fees will be based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle number, and will increase over the next three years. Exemptions apply to empty vessels carrying bulk exports and ships moving goods between American ports. The move comes amid concerns that it could further disrupt global trade already affected by Trump's tariffs.</p>

Both Mr Trump and Mr Bukele said they have no basis to send Abreo Garcia back to the US, even though the Trump administration called his deportation an "administrative error".</p>
