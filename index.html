          <p>Former President Trump announced that he intends to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump expressed hope for a productive day that could lead to a ceasefire, emphasizing that the war should have never occurred. The Kremlin confirmed the planned call, marking the second publicly acknowledged conversation between Trump and Putin on the topic during Trump's second term, after their first call in February was celebrated by Moscow. This development follows direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul, which resulted in a prisoner swap but no ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a critical presidential election between the hard-right "sovereignist" George Simion and the pro-EU liberal Nicusor Dan, with the outcome potentially triggering a crisis in the European Union. Simion, known for his pro-Russian views and nationalist rhetoric, won the first round, while Dan, the current mayor of Bucharest, advocates for closer European integration. The election is considered pivotal due to Romania's strategic importance within the EU and NATO, particularly its long border with Ukraine and its role in regional security, making the choice between democracy and illiberalism crucial for the country's future.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly pursuing a deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, aiming to avoid military conflict, despite resistance from conservative factions within the U.S. government. While Trump insists on halting uranium enrichment, Iran maintains its right to enrichment for civilian purposes under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Negotiations are ongoing, led by Steve Witkoff, with potential compromises involving long-term freezes on enrichment and phased sanctions relief. However, significant gaps remain, testing Trump's ability to navigate domestic opposition and secure a lasting agreement.</p>
