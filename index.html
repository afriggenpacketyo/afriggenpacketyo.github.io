          <p>Following a national outcry, the Trump administration has reversed its decision to revoke the legal status of a four-year-old girl and her family, who came to the U.S. in 2023 seeking medical care for a rare condition. The family's humanitarian parole was initially terminated, leading to a deportation order, but doctors warned that the girl would likely die if forced to return to Mexico. Democratic lawmakers intervened, urging the Department of Homeland Security to extend the family's legal status, emphasizing the need for humanitarian aid. The administration has now granted the family humanitarian parole for one year, effective June 2, 2025, allowing the child to continue receiving life-saving treatment.</p>

Banks criticized Reese for accusing Fever fans of racism and expressed disappointment that the Fever and WNBA have not apologized for the false accusations. He argues that the allegations are demeaning to the state and its fan base, especially given the WNBA's "No Space for Hate" initiative launched this season.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lifted restrictions imposed on Wells Fargo in 2018 following a scandal involving the creation of fake accounts. The asset restriction, which limited the bank's growth, was put in place due to a toxic sales culture that pressured employees to open unauthorized accounts. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf announced that each of the bank's 215,000 employees would receive a $2,000 award for turning the bank around. The removal of the asset cap allows Wells Fargo to pursue growth in deposits, new accounts, and investment banking businesses.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and blaming those who voted for it. Musk, who recently left the Trump administration, expressed concerns that the bill would massively increase the budget deficit and burden citizens with unsustainable debt. The legislation includes tax breaks, increased defense spending, and a raised debt ceiling. Musk's comments reflect wider tensions within the Republican Party over the bill, which faces opposition in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded a Biden-era policy that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions, according to a New York Times article. The decision revolves around the interpretation of a federal law that bars hospitals from turning away poor or uninsured patients. This move signals a shift in the administration's stance on abortion access and healthcare regulations.</p>

          <p>The UK has been temporarily exempted from US President Donald Trump's executive order that doubles tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%. This exemption is tied to the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (ECD) signed in May, which aims to eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs. The UK government said it is "committed to protecting British business and jobs" and will continue to work with the US to implement the agreement. However, Trump indicated that the US might increase the tariff on the UK on or after July 9, 2025, if it determines that the UK has not complied with relevant aspects of the EPD.</p>
