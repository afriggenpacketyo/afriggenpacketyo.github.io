          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a top NFL Draft pick, experienced a significant drop in the draft, with several quarterbacks being selected before him. Despite the unexpected fall, Sanders remains confident, expressing gratitude to God on social media. Reports surfaced earlier in the week suggesting some coaches viewed Sanders as "entitled" and "not that good," potentially impacting his draft stock. The remaining rounds of the draft will determine where Sanders ultimately lands, as teams reassess their quarterback needs. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision to charge a sitting judge marks an escalation in the Trump administration's battle with local authorities over deportations. The arrest underscores the administration's intent to take a harder line against those who impede federal immigration enforcement efforts.</p>
