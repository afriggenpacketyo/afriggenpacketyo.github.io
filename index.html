          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" and "sex" as biological. The guidance addresses the inclusion of transgender individuals in single-sex facilities like hospitals and schools, stating that trans women should not be permitted to use women's facilities. The EHRC emphasizes the need to protect transgender individuals from discrimination while balancing the rights and safety of all individuals.</p>
