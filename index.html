          <p>eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform, experienced a 40% surge in its stock price during its Nasdaq debut after raising nearly $310 million in its IPO. The company sold almost 6 million shares at $52 each, exceeding the expected range of $46 to $50, resulting in a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. Wall Street is closely watching eToro as a potential indicator of renewed interest in IPOs, especially after previous delays due to tariff concerns. Other fintech companies like Chime and Hinge Health are also testing the IPO market, indicating a possible resurgence in initial public offerings.</p>

The tariffs have been lowered to 30% for 90 days, meaning there's going to be a Christmas this year.

Chelsea currently sits fifth in the league, but their Champions League qualification is uncertain due to close competition with Aston Villa.

          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced new legislation to address overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales, which are described as being in crisis. The changes will limit how long some offenders can be returned to prison for breaching their license terms, aiming to free up around 1,400 prison places. The move is intended to bypass lengthy parole board assessments and will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years, who have been released and recalled for breaching their license terms. Mahmood warned that building new prisons would not be sufficient to resolve the crisis and that the government would face running out of spaces for male offenders by November.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report highlights the reasons why Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs compared to other high-income countries. A RAND Corporation study found that drug prices in the U.S. are almost three times higher on average than in 33 other nations, mainly due to the complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control. Drug prices in the U.S. are typically set by pharmaceutical companies and negotiated by private insurers, unlike many European countries where governments negotiate directly with drug companies. However, unbranded generic drugs tend to be cheaper for U.S. patients compared to other nations.</p>

This position poses a challenge for the Trump administration, which finds Russian officials making extreme demands that do not align with the actual battlefield situation.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers, who claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse, had previously been serving life sentences without the possibility of parole. A judge struck the special circumstance that previously barred them from parole consideration, citing new evidence. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings, with relatives expressing hope for their release.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that men are twice as likely to die from stress-related heart condition commonly called "broken heart syndrome" compared to women. The condition, formally known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is associated with severe emotional distress or stressful events. A study analyzing data from nearly 200,000 U.S. adults found that while the condition is more common among women, the death rate among men was significantly higher. Researchers suggest hormonal differences or physical stress being a more common trigger for men could contribute to the discrepancy.</p>

One of Cantor’s investments was a $775m purchase of shares in Rumble, a Trump-aligned video platform, in a deal that closed in February.

Shipments arriving in the United States from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800 could face 54 percent tariffs. For the past decade, a tax loophole known as the de minimis exemption allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the United States without import duties, angering American businesses that said the loophole made it difficult for them to compete.
