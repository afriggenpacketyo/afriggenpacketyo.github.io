          <p>President Donald Trump has invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act to place the city's police force under federal control and deploy 800 National Guard troops, citing what he described as rampant crime and squalor. The move, which is historically unprecedented, was met with strong condemnation from local officials who pointed to official statistics showing that violent crime in the district has actually fallen to a 30-year low. Trump justified the action as a "Liberation Day" for the capital, while D.C.'s attorney general labeled it "unnecessary, and unlawful," signaling a potential legal challenge against the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially stated that gold will not be subjected to tariffs, resolving recent market uncertainty. The announcement came via a post on his Truth Social platform, following reports from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that suggested the precious metal might face duties. Gold futures had reached a record high on the speculation, prompting the White House to promise an executive order to clarify the situation. This confirmation provides a clear policy stance, ending the speculation that had influenced recent trading activity in the commodities market.</p>

          <p>Amid rising living costs and economic uncertainty, some seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity without having to make monthly payments. This financial tool allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert a portion of their home's value into cash. The article suggests this option could be particularly beneficial for three groups: those needing to supplement a fixed retirement income, those with significant home equity but low liquid cash, and those who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. While offering a potential solution, the article stresses that a reverse mortgage is a significant decision with potential risks. (not investment advice)</p>

France has issued its highest-level red alert for several regions, while the U.K. has issued amber heat health warnings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal trial has begun in California concerning President Trump's authority to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles to handle protests. The case pits the Trump administration against California Governor Gavin Newsom, who argues the deployment was an illegal infringement on state authority and a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. While a lower court initially sided with Newsom, a federal appeals court reversed that decision, granting deference to the president's authority. The trial's outcome could set a significant precedent for presidential power, especially as the administration has recently federalized the National Guard in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights office has condemned a targeted Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed six journalists, including five from Al Jazeera, calling it a grave violation of international law. Israel's military claimed it targeted correspondent Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim he had denied and for which Israel has provided limited evidence. Media rights groups like Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have voiced outrage, demanding an independent investigation. The attack brings the number of journalists killed in the conflict since October 2023 to at least 186, according to the CPJ.</p>

          <p>In an unconventional agreement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the federal government 15% of their revenue from artificial intelligence chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted. President Trump confirmed he personally negotiated the deal with Nvidia's CEO, stating the revenue would benefit the country. The revenue-sharing plan is a highly unusual move, as export licenses are typically not fee-based, and it reflects the administration's transactional approach to managing technology exports and national security concerns related to China.</p>

For investors, the deal is seen as a net positive, as 85% of revenue is better than zero, though it raises long-term uncertainty.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, becoming the fifth named storm of the current hurricane season. Located west of the Cabo Verde islands, the storm currently poses no immediate threat to the United States. However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season as it moves west toward the Caribbean later in the week. The development of Erin aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season, which typically peaks between August and October.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned President Trump that he will lead an effort to redraw his state's congressional maps if Republicans in Texas and other states proceed with mid-decade redistricting. In a letter, Newsom accused the GOP of attempting to "rig the upcoming midterm elections" and destabilize democracy. He stated that if Republican-led states do not stand down from their efforts, California would be forced to redraw its own districts to neutralize any partisan gains. This threat escalates the national political battle over redistricting, which has already seen Texas Democratic lawmakers flee their state to block a vote.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithium-related stocks experienced a surge on Monday following news that Chinese battery giant CATL has suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The suspension was due to an expired permit, and the company is working to renew it to resume operations. This single mine accounts for approximately 4% of the projected global lithium supply for 2025, and its temporary closure has tightened an already constrained market. As a result, investors anticipate a rise in lithium prices, which has driven up the share prices of miners like Albemarle and related ETFs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was among approximately 300 parliamentarians detained by police in New Delhi during a protest against alleged electoral malpractice. The demonstrators marched on the Election Commission headquarters, claiming that recent electoral roll revisions in key states, like Bihar, are designed to benefit Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling BJP party. Critics argue the process could disenfranchise millions, particularly Muslims, by requiring documentation that many citizens in poorer regions lack. The BJP government supports the changes, stating they are necessary to remove illegal immigrants from voter lists.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has rejected the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking case. Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that releasing the materials would risk undermining the fundamental secrecy of grand jury proceedings. He also noted that the transcripts contained no significant new information beyond what was presented at Maxwell's trial and dismissed the government's motion as a potential "diversion" rather than a genuine move for transparency. The decision comes amid political pressure on the Trump administration to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>A new wellness trend, dubbed "cowmaxxing," is gaining popularity, promoting the use of cow-based products like beef tallow moisturizer, raw milk, and supplements made from bovine organs and colostrum. Proponents, including some influencers and political figures, claim these products offer superior health benefits, from clearer skin to improved gut health, by embracing a more "natural" and "ancestral" lifestyle. However, many of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and public health officials warn that some practices, like drinking raw milk, can be dangerous. The trend reflects a broader cultural desire for purity and a distrust of modern, processed goods.</p>

Over 1,000 firefighters are working to contain the blaze, which was caused by lightning and has burned over 130,000 acres west of Denver with only 7% containment. Another significant blaze, the Elk fire, is also active in the region, prompting evacuation orders for several mountain communities and a correctional center. Governor Jared Polis has declared a disaster emergency to support response efforts as smoke from the fires triggers air quality warnings across the state.</p>

Farley stated the company is radically changing its design and manufacturing processes to lower costs and build EVs that address what consumers truly want.
