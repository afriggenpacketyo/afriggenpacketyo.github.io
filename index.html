          <p>CVS Caremark will stop covering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, impacting thousands of Americans who will be forced to switch to a less effective medication, according to new research. This decision highlights the power of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and their secret deals with drugmakers, which can limit patients' access to treatments. While CVS Caremark claims this move will lower drug prices, patients and doctors express concern over the disruption of treatments and reduced ability to tailor prescriptions. This change will only affect patients with private insurance whose employer opted for the benefit manager’s most popular list of medicines.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane carried dozens of white South Africans, claiming discrimination, to the United States as refugees, a move that contrasts with the Trump administration's restrictive refugee policies. This has sparked criticism, with some viewing it as a politically motivated attempt to discredit South Africa, while others argue it is a necessary response to racial discrimination against Afrikaners. The refugee process for this group has been expedited, raising questions about the fairness of the system. Optimism score is 50.</p>
