          <p>The Japanese government is launching offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The government hopes marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp will play a key role in mitigating climate change due to their high CO2 absorption capacity. The Environment Ministry will commission studies to assess the environmental impact of such projects, with a goal to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040. This initiative reflects Japan's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

Trump argues these cuts will create jobs and boost the U.S. economy. However, the article questions what everyday Americans are trading away in the process, as these changes could have significant environmental and health consequences.

          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their young daughter from her father, who was convicted of child sexual assault, criticizes a new government bill. The Victims and Courts Bill would remove parental responsibility from convicted individuals convicted of child sexual assault, but only if they abused their own children. The family spent over Â£30,000 to protect their daughter, as the father retained parental responsibility despite his conviction. The government says it will continue to improve the law to ensure it is as strong as it needs to be.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, the acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer and former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, has died at the age of 98. Grigorovich, who led the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, was celebrated for revitalizing male dance and creating productions such as "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet." His work was deeply rooted in classical ballet traditions, and he is remembered as one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to the first ever dancers' strike at the theatre in its 200-year history.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's potential to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. CATL's IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally. The company plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's expansion into Europe comes amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China.</p>

          <p>A Peruvian man has been arrested after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on an expressway in central Japan, resulting in collisions with multiple vehicles. The 34-year-old resident of Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, was arrested for failing to report an accident after hitting two vehicles on the Shin-Meishin Expressway. The incident led to a pile-up involving four vehicles, injuring four women. The man is believed to have continued driving the wrong way for about 10 kilometers after the initial collisions, and police suspect he may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway.</p>

The revision follows Honda's earlier announcement that it would delay the operations of an EV plant in Canada by two years, initially scheduled to start in 2028.
