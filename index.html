          <p>Christopher Schwarzenegger's recent weight loss was prominently featured in photos from a family lake trip shared by his sister, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt. He has been on a health journey since 2019, motivated by a desire to more easily participate in everyday activities. His father, Arnold Schwarzenegger, expressed pride in his son's self-discipline and motivation, noting that the family supported him by introducing healthy foods and gym access without direct pressure. The transformation has been highlighted in several family social media posts over the past few years.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, including members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, has warned that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are severely harming Asian-American-owned businesses. They argue that these small "mom and pop" stores are facing extreme cost increases, forcing them to either raise prices for consumers or risk shutting down entirely. Lawmakers shared specific examples, such as a restaurant seeing its spice costs double and an importer's shipping costs for medicinal oil increasing from $500 to $13,000 for a single shipment. The group is urging the administration to reverse the duties to prevent further economic damage.</p>

The company posted an adjusted earnings per share of $3.83 on $22.24 billion in revenue, attributing the success to strategic initiatives that are reducing costs and improving customer experience. The growth was driven by a 6% increase in average daily volumes for domestic packages, though its Freight segment saw a decline. FedEx also provided a positive outlook for 2026, forecasting revenue growth between 4% and 6%. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the backlash against Jimmy Kimmel is part of a broader political effort to punish dissent and misuse government power, framing it as an attack on the values of Los Angeles. The author contends that the controversy is less about Kimmel's specific comments and more about making an example of a prominent figure from a city that embodies inclusivity and progressive ideals. The piece connects the censorship of Kimmel to other governmental actions, such as immigration raids and pressure on universities, suggesting they are all part of a unified assault on civil liberties. It calls for residents to recognize these threats as interconnected and to defend the city's foundational principles.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity company Netskope saw its stock jump over 18% on its first day of trading on the Nasdaq, achieving a market capitalization of $8.6 billion. The company, which specializes in data and network security for cloud and AI applications, raised over $908 million in its initial public offering. The successful debut signals a renewed appetite in the IPO market, which had been sluggish due to economic uncertainties.

          <p>Intel's stock experienced its best day since 1987, surging nearly 23% after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in the company. The strategic collaboration will focus on co-developing data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's AI and computing expertise with Intel's central processing units (CPUs). This investment follows recent support for Intel's turnaround from the U.S. government and SoftBank, significantly boosting the chipmaker's market position. The White House praised the partnership as a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, though the deal does not currently include Nvidia manufacturing chips at Intel's foundries.

          <p>In an interview, political violence scholar Arie Perliger argues that the public discourse following Charlie Kirk's assassination has been unproductive, with both political sides cherry-picking details to fit their narratives. Perliger suggests that instead of focusing on the shooter's individual politics, it is more important to examine the societal conditions that facilitate such violence, such as extreme political polarization and a dysfunctional political system. He explains that when people lose faith in democratic processes, they may turn to extreme actions. The article highlights his view that both the left and right contribute to a climate of delegitimization that normalizes political violence.</p>

          <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is urgently seeking to lease hundreds of private office spaces across the country to accommodate a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers for widespread raids.

The rush for new facilities is causing chaos and frustration among GSA employees, who recently endured major downsizing and lease cancellations under a government efficiency initiative.

A White House official stated frankly that the trip would not alter the president's positions on key issues like trade and tariffs. While the two leaders publicly downplayed disagreements, such as the UK's plan to recognize Palestinian statehood, the analysis concludes that Starmer's primary achievement was maintaining a respectful relationship without changing Trump's fundamental stances.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is praised as a bleak but captivating vision of modern times, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former revolutionary vigilante living in hiding. The movie, inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland," is set in the present day and touches on urgent themes of political violence and government overreach. The review highlights the film's departure from Anderson's typically slower pace, delivering a kinetic action thriller with beautifully shot car chases and shoot-outs. The performances of DiCaprio, Sean Penn, and newcomer Chase Infiniti are lauded in what is described as an emotional and visceral triumph.</p>

          <p>Transportation ministers from Germany's 16 federal states have agreed to raise the price of the "Deutschlandticket," a popular monthly public transit pass, to €63 starting in January 2026. This is the second price hike for the ticket, which allows for unlimited travel on local and regional transportation across the country and currently costs €58. While officials described the decision as a necessary compromise to ensure the program's continuation until 2030, mobility associations criticized the move. Critics fear the higher price will undermine trust and lead to widespread cancellations, particularly among younger subscribers who rely on its affordability.</p>

The kits, which include essential items like diapers and hygiene products, are funded by a $9 million allocation in the state budget as part of a larger commitment to maternal health and affordable childcare. Baby2Baby addresses the significant financial burden of diapers for low-income families, noting that one in two U.S. families struggles with this cost. The organization has developed a manufacturing system that produces diapers at a substantially lower cost, enabling wider distribution.</p>

          <p>The government's response to criticism following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a fierce debate over free speech. Actions such as the State Department revoking visas for celebratory social media posts and Attorney General Pam Bondi's vow to target "hate speech" are causing alarm among legal experts. First Amendment scholars argue that these moves set a dangerous precedent, as most forms of hateful speech, short of direct incitement or threats, are constitutionally protected. The crackdown, which includes the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, is seen by critics as the government using its power to suppress lawful expression it disagrees with.</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny stated he is not performing in the 50 U.S. states on his current world tour due to fears that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could target his fans outside his concerts. Despite being a U.S. citizen from Puerto Rico, his concerns reflect a wider uncertainty within the arts community regarding immigration enforcement at cultural events. The Department of Homeland Security dismissed his claims as "fearmongering," but performers and presenters remain worried. The situation is compounded by new logistical and financial hurdles for foreign artists seeking U.S. work visas, which may lead others to bypass the country as well.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted Brayan Ramos-Brito, a Los Angeles protester, of charges that he assaulted a border patrol agent during a demonstration in June. The verdict is a significant setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents who testified, including a senior border patrol chief. Witness footage of the incident showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault. Discrepancies in official reports and the cross-examination of a key witness about past misconduct for derogatory comments appear to have influenced the jury's swift decision.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer successfully navigated President Trump's state visit without major public disputes, reinforcing the UK's partnership with the U.S. However, this analysis questions whether the carefully managed visit resulted in any substantive change in Trump's thinking on critical foreign policy issues like Gaza and Ukraine. While Trump expressed feeling "let down" by Vladimir Putin, he did not commit to new actions. The true test of Starmer's influence will depend on the private conversations between the two leaders and whether the diplomatic effort can translate into tangible policy shifts, particularly in persuading Trump to apply more pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has decreased slightly, making it a more affordable option for homeowners looking to tap into record-high equity levels. A new $50,000 home equity loan with a 10-year term now has an average monthly payment of about $618, while a 15-year term costs around $487 per month. These costs are marginally lower than they were before the rate cut. While a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may offer a lower initial rate, its variable nature makes budgeting less predictable compared to the fixed rate of a home equity loan.

          <p>This historical essay explores the unresolved tension in American higher education, which has been pulled between three competing purposes since the late 19th century: providing cultural formation, preparing students for work, and advancing academic research. The article contrasts the classical, culture-focused college model of the past with the modern university system, shaped by figures like Harvard's Charles W. Eliot, who pushed for more practical, career-oriented training. This long-standing identity crisis continues today, as debates over the "return on investment" of a college degree and the value of the humanities persist. The piece suggests that universities are still struggling to strike a balance between preparing students for living and preparing them for a job.</p>

          <p>This article traces the career evolution of Jimmy Kimmel, from his early days as the crass, apolitical "everyman" host of "The Man Show" to his current role as a prominent liberal voice and critic of President Trump. His political turn began in earnest in 2017 with emotional monologues about his son's health care needs and a mass shooting in his hometown of Las Vegas. The piece argues that Kimmel's transformation mirrors a broader shift in American pop culture and that his "regular guy" persona makes his political commentary particularly resonant. His suspension is framed not as a consequence of his past controversial comedy but as a direct result of his effective and persistent criticism of the president.</p>
