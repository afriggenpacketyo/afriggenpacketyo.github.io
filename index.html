          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1. This move escalates trade tensions, with President Trump citing Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl as a primary justification, though he also mentioned broader trade deficits. The Canadian government has stated it will continue to defend its workers and businesses while working toward a revised deadline for trade talks. These new duties are separate from existing sectoral tariffs on items like steel and aluminum, and the administration has warned of higher levies if Canada retaliates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated third fight between boxers Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano is scheduled to take place at New York's Madison Square Garden. Despite Taylor holding a 2-0 record in their previous encounters, the rivalry remains intense and commercially successful, with both fighters set for career-high paydays. Their first match in 2022 was a groundbreaking event for women's boxing, and the second was a gripping, albeit controversial, rematch. This final chapter is expected to deliver similar excitement, solidifying their rivalry as one of the great trilogies in modern sports history.</p>

          <p>A significant confrontation occurred in Ventura County, California, when U.S. Border Patrol agents executed a warrant at a marijuana facility, leading to a clash with protesters. Agents deployed tear gas and less-lethal rounds to control the crowd, which had gathered to protest the raid on farmworkers. The incident drew sharp criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, while federal officials reported finding ten unaccompanied minors at the site, prompting a child labor investigation. The standoff resulted in several injuries and arrests, highlighting the intense friction over federal immigration enforcement actions in the state.</p>

          <p>European nations, with U.S. participation for the first time, have agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a multinational force to be deployed in Ukraine after a ceasefire. The force aims to provide logistical support, train Ukrainian armed forces, and secure the country's skies and the Black Sea to deter future Russian aggression. The meeting, held in Rome, included a U.S. delegation with President Trump's special envoy and bipartisan senators, signaling unified Western support for Kyiv. While no U.S. troops will be on the ground, the move is seen as a crucial step in ensuring long-term security for Ukraine and Europe.</p>

The BMA maintains that the strike is necessary as the government has refused to negotiate on pay, which they claim is 20% lower in real terms than in 2008.

While acknowledging the F-35's superior capabilities, the watchdog highlighted that delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages are undermining the UK's warfighting capability. The fleet's mission-capable rate is only about a third of the Ministry of Defence's target, and key weapons integrations are delayed.

The judge appeared to agree that the government had not provided sufficient evidence to refute these claims of indiscriminate targeting. A final order is expected soon, which could place significant legal constraints on the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Russia has unleashed another large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine, with authorities reporting over 150 drones intercepted across multiple regions and at least one death from a drone crash. The intensified air assault comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal in Rome to discuss strengthening air defenses and imposing tougher sanctions on Russia. Zelenskyy emphasized the urgent need for more support, particularly interceptor drones, to counter Russia's escalating attacks. The meeting highlights Ukraine's push for advanced weaponry and stronger international pressure to end the war.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The collapse occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, part of a major county sanitation project. A massive response, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, was deployed to the scene. Fortunately, none of the workers sustained visible injuries, and they were able to escape by climbing over a large pile of dirt. The project has been put on hold as Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the incident to ensure site safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, temporarily halting the policy from taking effect while the legal challenge proceeds. This ruling comes after a Supreme Court decision that limited universal injunctions but still allowed for class-action suits as a legal pathway. The White House has criticized the decision as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court, vowing to fight the ruling.</p>

His legal team argues the actions were a retaliatory measure against his constitutionally protected speech.

The organization condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" and said it was investigating the incident while regretting any harm to civilians.

Museum curators described the find as incredibly unlikely, comparing it to hitting a "hole in one from the moon." While not scientifically groundbreaking, the discovery has generated excitement and is now on display, becoming the museum's deepest and oldest fossil found on its grounds.</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, met with President Donald Trump at the White House on the same day his company became the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. The meeting comes as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China, which the Trump administration implemented for national security reasons. President Trump praised the company's stock performance, linking it to his tariff policies. The discussion likely touched upon the significant impact of these trade restrictions, which have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the massive Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, partly justified by his opposition to the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, is based on a contested interpretation of his emergency economic powers. The move cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same law at the center of a court challenge against his previous tariffs. Critics argue this new tariff is an abuse of power, noting that Trump's claim of a U.S. trade deficit with Brazil is factually incorrect, as the U.S. actually runs a surplus. This action further complicates the legal battles over presidential tariff authority. (not investment advice)</p>
