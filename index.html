          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane, with its center projected to pass east of Bermuda. Maximum sustained winds reached 75 mph, and rapid intensification is possible over the next two days. Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada. Despite earlier predictions for an unusually busy season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated, with only one prior storm making landfall in the US. The article provides details on its current position and movement.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid publicly supported Travis Kelce's "passion" after the pair had their second sideline confrontation in consecutive weeks during the Chiefs' 22-9 victory over the New York Giants. Reid downplayed the incident, stating he was "OK with that" and that Kelce's emotional outbursts stemmed from his intense commitment to the game. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also reinforced the strong relationship between the coach and tight end, emphasizing that such displays are characteristic of great players.

          <p>London Gatwick Airport's £2.2bn second runway project has been approved by the Transport Secretary, aiming to boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The plan involves relocating the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters for regular use, projected to increase annual flights to 389,000 and passenger capacity to 80 million by the late 2030s. While hailed by the Chancellor as a key step to "get Britain building again," the project faces strong opposition from environmental groups, who label it a "disaster" for climate efforts. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is urging President Trump to support international efforts to raise the mandatory airline pilot retirement age from 65 to 67, arguing that current policy forces thousands of experienced pilots into early retirement. This appeal precedes a United Nations aviation meeting where an airline trade group will propose the change, backed by several nations. However, the Air Line Pilots Association opposes the move, citing studies on increased health risks and cognitive decline in older pilots, a stance that previously led Congress to reject a similar proposal. The article highlights the ongoing debate between industry needs and safety concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hailed conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a "great American hero" and "martyr" at a packed memorial service in Arizona, attended by tens of thousands. Trump's speech, which included partisan remarks against his opponents, contrasted with Kirk's widow, Erika, who expressed forgiveness for her husband's alleged killer. The event, featuring other Trump administration officials and conservative figures, framed Kirk's death as a galvanizing moment for the conservative movement. Attendees, many in MAGA attire, created an atmosphere resembling a political rally, emphasizing Kirk's deep faith and activism for American liberty.</p>

          <p>New York Giants fans at MetLife Stadium voiced their discontent with quarterback Russell Wilson's play, chanting "We want Dart" and eventually booing during a game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Wilson's performance included two interceptions and overall struggles with accuracy, prompting a brief appearance by backup Jaxson Dart in specific offensive situations. Head coach Brian Daboll acknowledged the fan reaction, admitting he would also be booing due to the team's inability to score and finish drives. The article underscores the growing frustration among the fanbase regarding the team's offensive struggles and Wilson's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Christian Horner has formally left Red Bull Racing, securing a reported 60 million euros (£52 million) severance package following his dismissal as team principal in July. His departure came after controversial sexual assault allegations, of which he was twice cleared, and amid a power struggle within the team that coincided with a decline in competitiveness. Key figures like design leader Adrian Newey and sporting director Jonathan Wheatley had also exited, and Horner lost main shareholder support after a poor performance at the British Grand Prix. Red Bull acknowledged his "exceptional work" in establishing the team's success.</p>

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's book, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the prevalent idea that increasing two-parent Black families would largely resolve racial inequality. Her research demonstrates that Black children in two-parent households still face significantly greater struggles than white children in similar family structures, performing only as well as white children from single-parent homes. Cross argues that the singular focus on marriage promotion diverts attention and resources from more effective interventions, such as direct cash assistance or childcare subsidies. The article highlights persistent resource gaps, like income and wealth, that contribute to ongoing inequality even within two-parent Black families.</p>

          <p>This article raises significant concerns that President Trump's potential control over the Federal Reserve, possibly by removing a governor, could grant him unchecked power far beyond setting interest rates. Experts warn that the Fed's authority to lend unlimited money during emergencies and its role as a financial regulator could be weaponized to reward political allies or punish opponents, bypassing congressional spending power. This could transform the central bank into a "bottomless slush fund" or enable "debanking" of perceived enemies, with few legal or market checks to prevent such abuses, posing a serious threat to democratic norms.</p>

However, experts and residents express significant concern that the rapid pace prioritized speed over safety, leading to potential shortcuts and lax oversight. A major issue is the federal government's decision to forgo post-cleanup soil testing, with university research subsequently finding elevated lead levels in many "cleaned" homes. This raises questions about the long-term safety of the recovery effort and the potential for homeowners to bear the burden of further remediation.</p>
