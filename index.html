          <p>North Korean state media reported that the country, under the supervision of leader Kim Jong Un, successfully test-fired two newly developed anti-aircraft missiles. The tests were conducted as the United States and South Korea held their annual joint military exercises, which Pyongyang has consistently condemned as a rehearsal for invasion. A spokesperson for the Korean People's Army described the drills as reckless actions by "warmongers" that were pushing the Korean Peninsula into a state of "extreme tension."</p>

          <p>Over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in the recent US-led "Northern Strike" military exercises in Michigan, marking the largest contingent ever sent by Taiwan. This public acknowledgment of Taiwan's involvement represents a notable shift from past US policy, which typically avoided publicizing such military cooperation. The development is widely interpreted as a significant deepening of defense ties between Washington and Taipei, aimed at enhancing Taiwan's self-defense capabilities amid regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning a significant overhaul of sentencing rules that would allow courts to impose broader restrictions on individuals with non-custodial sentences. The proposed reforms would empower judges to issue bans from pubs, concerts, and sports matches, as well as driving and travel prohibitions, for any offense. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the goal is to ensure criminals have their freedom restricted, though hospitality industry groups have raised concerns about the practical implementation of such measures.</p>

          <p>A new BBC series features the story of Shane Gorman, whose father, David, was one of 167 men killed in the 1988 Piper Alpha oil platform explosion. Gorman recounts the trauma of his loss and explains his decision to follow in his father's footsteps by becoming an offshore safety officer, driven by a need to understand the systemic failures that led to the tragedy. The article revisits the disaster's causes, the scathing findings of the subsequent public inquiry, and the lasting impact the event had on safety regulations in the North Sea oil industry.</p>

          <p>Russia has blamed a Ukrainian drone attack for causing a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant in its western region, though officials stated the blaze was quickly extinguished with no change in radiation levels. The alleged attack occurred as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day, which marks its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. On the same day, international allies including Canada, the UK, and Norway reaffirmed their support for Kyiv with high-level visits and new commitments for military aid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming 2026 Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) may prove insufficient for retirees due to a fundamental timing issue in its calculation. The adjustment is based on inflation data from the third quarter of the previous year, meaning recipients often endure months of higher prices before their benefits increase, thereby eroding their purchasing power. This structural lag could be particularly problematic if inflation accelerates later in the year, highlighting how the COLA consistently arrives too late to fully offset increased expenses.

          <p>In their final preseason game, the Los Angeles Chargers fell to the San Francisco 49ers 30-23 in a contest marked by sloppy play, including multiple turnovers and penalties. Despite the team's overall struggles, undrafted rookie linebacker Marlowe Wax delivered a standout performance with several key defensive plays, making a strong case for a spot on the final 53-man roster. The game provided a final opportunity for coaches to evaluate players on the roster bubble before cuts are made for the upcoming regular season.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned President Donald Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, labeling it an "abuse of power" and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." This proposed action is part of a broader administration strategy of sending troops to major Democrat-run cities under the pretext of cracking down on crime. Chicago's mayor also voiced "grave concerns," warning that an "unlawful deployment" could inflame local tensions and undermine public safety efforts.</p>
