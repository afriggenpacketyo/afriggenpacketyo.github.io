          <p>Texas Republican Representative Michael McCaul stated he will vote for the Senate's proposed spending bill, emphasizing its provisions for border security, defense, and tax cut extensions. In an interview, McCaul dismissed concerns about the bill increasing the national deficit, arguing that dynamic scoring, which predicts increased revenue from tax cuts, was not considered by the Congressional Budget Office. He also addressed national security, asserting that a recent military operation against Iran has made the Middle East safer and that recently arrested Iranian nationals in the U.S. highlight the need for vigilance. McCaul expressed confidence that fiscally conservative colleagues will ultimately support the legislation.</p>

          <p>Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, affirmed that uranium enrichment is an "inalienable right" for his country and will not stop, framing it within the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He denied official threats against IAEA Director Rafael Grossi, attributing calls for his execution to individual opinions in the media, while confirming that UN inspectors in Iran are safe but have had their access suspended. Iravani stated that current conditions are not suitable for direct negotiations with the U.S. following recent military aggression, rejecting any talks that amount to a demand for unconditional surrender rather than a mutual give-and-take process.</p>

          <p>The racing film "F1 The Movie," starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski, secured the top spot at the box office with a $55.6 million domestic debut, marking the biggest opening weekend for an Apple-produced film. The movie, which also earned $88 million internationally, exceeded expectations but still faces a long road to profitability given its budget of over $200 million. Its success was bolstered by strong promotion for Imax screenings and positive audience reception, earning an "A" grade from CinemaScore. This hit provides a significant theatrical victory for Apple, whose previous high-profile films have struggled to attract large audiences.</p>

          <p>As "Love Island USA" experiences its most-watched season, the show is confronting intense cyberbullying directed at its contestants, prompting a public plea for kindness from the host and producers. This issue reflects a long-standing problem within the reality TV franchise, which has been linked to severe mental health struggles for past participants in its UK counterpart, including depression, anxiety, and several tragic deaths. While producers state they have enhanced mental health support, providing psychologists and welfare managers, experts note that the fundamental nature of reality TV, which thrives on conflict and drama, creates an inherent tension with ensuring contestant well-being. The rise in online harassment underscores the complex duty of care required for individuals thrust into overnight fame.</p>

          <p>During an interview on Fox News, President Donald Trump suggested that the United States engages in the same type of hacking and intelligence gathering that China is accused of conducting. When asked by host Maria Bartiromo how he could negotiate with China given its history of bad acts, Trump responded, "You don't think we do that to them?" adding that such activities are simply "the way the world works." The president maintained that he has a great relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping but emphasized that China would continue to face substantial tariffs. The comments drew parallels to a 2017 interview where he responded to Vladimir Putin being called a killer by stating the U.S. has killers too.</p>

The legislation, which combines permanent tax cuts with increased defense and border security funding, now faces a lengthy amendment process.

          <p>A policy analysis argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to China's dominance over the global supply of rare earth minerals, which are essential for modern technology and defense. The article highlights China's recent export controls as a weaponization of this dependency, criticizing years of insufficient US response across multiple administrations. While a recent trade framework offers a temporary reprieve, it exposes US firms to "competitive surveillance" and fails to address the core issue. The author calls for a unified, long-term national strategy to build a secure supply chain, treating critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BeyoncÃ© was forced to abruptly stop her performance in Houston when a major stage prop, a red Cadillac suspended by cables, began to tilt dangerously mid-air. The singer, who was sitting in the car high above the audience, was seen clinging to a flagpole for support as she called for the music to stop. The vehicle was safely lowered to the ground, and no one was injured in the incident, which her company later described as a "technical mishap." Fans captured the tense moment on video, recalling other instances of prop malfunctions on BeyoncÃ©'s tours, as the star continued the show without further issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to dismantle federal energy efficiency regulations, including the popular Energy Star program, which helps consumers identify energy-saving appliances. Following a presidential executive order, the Department of Energy and the EPA are planning to eliminate or modify dozens of rules governing appliances like dishwashers, light bulbs, and toilets. The move has drawn opposition from consumer and environmental groups, who warn it could lead to higher utility bills and remove a trusted guide for shoppers. However, the administration argues the current standards drive up costs and reduce product quality, while some manufacturers support deregulation, stating that modern appliances are already near peak efficiency.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, has apologized after a technical error led to thousands of Eurojackpot players being incorrectly notified that they had won millions of kroner. The mistake was caused by a faulty currency conversion from euros to kroner, which multiplied the prize amounts by 100 instead of dividing them. While no incorrect payments were made, the error caused widespread disappointment and anger, prompting the company's CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, to resign. The incident is the latest in a series of technical problems for Norsk Tipping, which now faces increased scrutiny from the government and the public.</p>

          <p>The recently designated SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands national monument in northern California, a sacred area for the Pit River Tribe, faces an uncertain future following President Trump's pledge to undo the protection. The designation, granted by President Biden, protects nearly 230,000 acres of forested lands from industrial development while preserving its cultural and ecological significance. However, the Trump administration has signaled its intent to rescind this and other monument protections to open land for economic use, backed by a recent Justice Department memo.

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the modern conservative movement. The book traces a direct line from Buckley's intellectual leadership to key political figures like Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and ultimately, Donald Trump. Tanenhaus argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics through his magazine, National Review, and TV show, "Firing Line," which reshaped the Republican Party. While Buckley was known for his intellectualism and civility, the biography concludes that he paved the way for the brasher, more populist conservatism embodied by Trump today.</p>

Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring Universal Credit's health-related component rises with inflation.

The problem is rooted in complex regulatory challenges and the difficulty of detecting faulty medicines without laboratory testing.

          <p>Wimbledon will feature 23 British players in the men's and women's singles tournaments, the largest home contingent since 1984, reflecting a growing depth of talent in the nation's tennis ranks. Jack Draper, ranked fourth in the world, leads the British hopes in the men's draw, while Emma Raducanu returns as the British women's number one. The strong representation is attributed to a combination of factors, including the inspiration of Andy Murray, improved training facilities, and a healthy rivalry among a new generation of players. The home presence is further bolstered by numerous wildcards awarded to up-and-coming and veteran players.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Urges Supermarkets to Promote Healthier Food Choices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:42:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans requiring supermarkets and food manufacturers to make it easier for customers to purchase healthy food. Under the strategy, retailers will partner with the government to encourage healthier shopping habits, with potential methods including promotions, loyalty point incentives, or altered store layouts. The policy, which will involve retailers reporting on healthy food sales, aims to tackle rising obesity rates and relieve pressure on the NHS. While the Health Secretary framed it as a collaborative approach, the opposition criticized the plan as a "nanny state" measure, arguing it is not the government's role to dictate consumer purchases.</p>

          <h2>Senate Advances Trump's Sweeping Tax and Spending Bill in Key Procedural Vote</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly advanced President Trump's signature "big, beautiful bill" in a 51-49 procedural vote after hours of intense negotiations to secure support from conservative holdouts. The legislation, a top priority for the president, combines the extension of his 2017 tax cuts with increased spending on the military and border security. The bill now moves to a lengthy debate and amendment process, known as a vote-a-rama, with Democrats forcing a full reading of the 940-page text. Despite its advancement, the bill faces fierce opposition from Democrats and criticism from some, including Elon Musk, over its potential impact on the national debt and green energy.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Sets Deadline for Chinese Immigrants to Renounce China Household Registration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:36:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 12,000 Chinese immigrants in Taiwan face a looming deadline to prove they have relinquished their household registration in China or risk losing their residency rights and potential deportation. The policy is part of a broader set of national security measures by President Lai Ching-te's administration to counter Chinese influence. Many affected immigrants, some of whom have lived in Taiwan for decades, have expressed fear and frustration, describing the process of obtaining the required documents from Chinese authorities as difficult and risky. While the government has offered an affidavit option for some, the policy has heightened tensions and stigmatized the immigrant community.</p>
