          <p>Two Israeli embassy staff members were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended after shouting pro-Palestinian slogans and is being questioned by authorities. The victims, identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were a couple about to be engaged. Officials have condemned the shooting as an act of antisemitism, with Israeli leaders calling it a horrific terrorist attack resulting from toxic incitement since the October 7th massacre. President Trump also condemned the attacks, emphasizing that hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. </p>

Additionally, the bill creates a $12 billion fund for border security efforts and accelerates the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit phaseout for wind, solar, and battery storage to 2028. </p>

          <p>Two Mexico City officials, a personal secretary and a close advisor of Mexico City's Mayor Clara Brugada, were murdered in a rush-hour shooting on a busy avenue. The murders were meticulously planned by experienced gunmen, prosecutors said Wednesday. At least four people were involved in the killing. The gunman had fled on a motorcycle that was hidden nearby and then changed vehicles twice as he and others fled into neighboring Mexico State. The circumstances suggest it was a direct attack and with an important degree of planning. One suspect was seen carrying out surveillance of the victims in the area of the attack in preceding days. </p>

          <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa's attempt to reset relations with the U.S. backfired when President Trump focused on false accusations of white genocide. Trump showed footage of a South African politician calling for the killing of Afrikaners, despite Ramaphosa's efforts to discuss trade and economic ties. South Africa needs the United States more than ever, with unemployment and inequality soaring, economic growth tepid and violence against South Africans of all races rampant. Despite the contentious meeting, Ramaphosa claimed success, citing progress on a trade deal and Trump's potential attendance at the G20 summit in Johannesburg. </p>

          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing in the UK has increased the likelihood of tax rises in the autumn, according to experts. Borrowing in April reached £20.2 billion, £1 billion higher than the same month last year, making it the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. Analysts suggest that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may struggle to meet spending and borrowing rules, with weaker economic growth impacting tax receipts. The potential reinstatement of winter fuel payments and increased defense spending further intensify the pressure for tax increases. </p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to install a new missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," resembling Israel's Iron Dome, has ignited controversy. The system aims to protect the U.S. from threats by air and outer space, costing an estimated $175 billion by 2029. Critics cite enormous costs and an unrealistic timeframe, while China has accused Trump of undermining global stability. Canada has expressed interest in joining the project. The system is intended to defend against intercontinental missiles with nuclear weapons, building on Reagan-era "Star Wars" missile defense plans. </p>

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing criticism over a proposed 10% rate hike to fund wildfire mitigation, following scrutiny over its role in the deadly Eaton fire. Ratepayers and consumer advocates argue that customers already pay high electricity bills. The CPUC is expected to make a decision this summer on the rate request. Edison plans to spend about $1.4 billion annually on wildfire mitigation, including undergrounding power lines. Some have called out recent bonuses given to Edison executives despite the company's equipment sparking wildfires. </p>

          <p>Paul Elie's "The Last Supper" captures a pivotal moment in social history when religion, art, and sexuality collided in the 1980s. The book surveys artists who grappled with crypto-religion, creating thought-provoking art in response to Ronald Reagan's rise and the conservative Christian movement. Artists such as Andy Warhol, Sinéad O'Connor, Bob Dylan, and Martin Scorsese negotiated the liminal space between belief and non-belief, producing work that challenged the church's narrow views. The book is a reminder of art's power in matters of the heart and soul. </p>
