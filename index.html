        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to formalize a deal allowing TikTok to operate in the U.S. under a new corporate structure, aiming to address national security concerns. This agreement designates it a "qualified divestiture," pushing back enforcement of a congressional ban by 120 days to finalize terms. Under the deal, Oracle will provide comprehensive security by hosting U.S. user data and reviewing TikTok's proprietary content recommendation algorithm, which will be retrained specifically for the American user base. The new U.S.-based entity is valued at $14 billion, with a majority of American investors and board members, though China-based ByteDance will retain a 19.9% ownership stake. This resolution aims to ensure the popular platform can operate safely and securely for its millions of users.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has convened a rare and unusually large meeting of numerous generals, admirals, and their staff from around the world at Quantico, Virginia, next week. While specific details remain scarce from the Pentagon, it is anticipated that the Secretary of War will address his senior military leaders on critical defense matters. This significant gathering follows Hegseth's earlier proposals to implement substantial cuts, including a 20% reduction in four-star and National Guard general positions. Speculation suggests the meeting could also involve the unveiling of the new National Defense Strategy, which is released every four years. President Trump, who recently renamed the Defense Department, publicly expressed his approval for the unprecedented assembly.</p>

          <p>Emergency 911 systems experienced a widespread outage across Mississippi and Louisiana on Thursday afternoon, causing significant disruption to public safety services. Authorities attributed the failure to damaged AT&T fiber optic lines, impacting most parishes in both states, including major population centers like Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Officials quickly urged residents to call alternative local phone numbers for emergencies, emphasizing there was no indication of malicious activity. While a resolution was expected within hours, the incident highlighted critical vulnerabilities in communication infrastructure. This extensive disruption underscored the vital importance of reliable emergency services for community stability and safety.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed music producer Jack Antonoff, known for his work with Taylor Swift, publicly criticized Live Nation Entertainment CEO Michael Rapino's assertion that concert tickets are "underpriced." Antonoff, advocating for fan fairness, proposed making it illegal to sell tickets above face value, arguing this would eliminate market chaos and restore control to artists. His comments come as the Federal Trade Commission has sued Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster for alleged illegal ticket resale tactics and antitrust violations. Antonoff emphasized that the current system often exploits audiences, and his team actively seeks innovative solutions to make concert experiences more affordable for fans.</p>

          <p>Bryson DeChambeau has undergone a significant transformation, emerging as a "gladiator" figure for the American Ryder Cup team, shedding his past image of individualism. Despite his controversial move to LIV Golf, his strong performances in major championships, including a 2024 US Open victory, secured his automatic qualification. Teammates and captain Keegan Bradley now commend his renewed team-first approach and "fiery" energy, a notable shift from previous ambivalence. DeChambeau's growing YouTube presence and association with former President Trump further amplify his profile, positioning him as a potential unifying force and talisman for the U.S. side as they seek to reclaim the trophy.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has commenced a phased restart of its operations, with several IT systems now back online following a cyber-attack in August that forced a company-wide shutdown.

However, production lines remain suspended until next month, prompting growing concerns for the financial stability of many suppliers, particularly small businesses.

          <p>Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook urged the Supreme Court to reject President Trump's request to fire her, arguing it would undermine the Federal Reserve Board's independence. Trump seeks to remove Cook over alleged mortgage fraud, claims she denies, following his criticisms of the Fed's interest rate policies. A coalition of former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries also pressed the Supreme Court to deny Trump's request to remove Cook for now. The core legal question is whether Trump has the "legal cause" required by the Federal Reserve Act to dismiss a governor, a standard Cook's lawyers argue is not met by "flimsy, unproven allegations." The ongoing litigation highlights a significant challenge to the central bank's autonomy.</p>

          <p>U.S. new car sales have received an unexpected boost heading into the fourth quarter, prompting Cox Automotive to revise its 2025 sales forecast upward to 16.1 million units. This surprising resilience in demand is largely attributed to consumers accelerating their purchases, driven by fears of impending tariffs and anticipated higher prices. Additionally, a surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales occurred ahead of the expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this month. While this "pull-ahead" effect benefits the automotive industry in the short term, analysts predict a slowdown in sales for the fourth quarter and into the upcoming year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced its "most powerful strike" in Yemen, with dozens of aircraft bombing Houthi security, intelligence, and military targets in Sanaa. This action was a response to repeated Houthi drone and missile attacks on Israel, including a recent drone attack in Eilat that injured 22 people. The Houthi-run health ministry reported eight killed and 142 injured, alleging civilian facilities were hit and calling it a "brutal crime." Israel's Defense Minister vowed further offensive operations against the Houthi regime, which has been attacking Israel and international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians since October 2023.</p>

          <p>Twenty-four hours after a fatal shooting at the Dallas ICE facility, migrants, unaware of its closure, arrived for their scheduled appointments, fearing deportation for non-attendance. Many had traveled long distances, like A. from Colombia and Marcos from Venezuela, who received no official notification of the postponement until Monday. Dallas Police officers, with limited Spanish proficiency, struggled to direct the confused individuals, highlighting a communication gap. This situation underscores the vulnerability of immigrants navigating complex legal processes and the human impact of disruptions to critical government services.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in Oregon for Ty Anthony Sage, a murder suspect who was mistakenly released from prison on bail, despite having been denied bail in court. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office called the error "unacceptable," stating an initial release order incorrectly indicated a $5,000 bail. Sage, 26, faces second-degree murder and first-degree robbery charges related to the 2021 death of 15-year-old Lowgunn Ivey. Authorities are reviewing the incident and searching "across the state," while the victim's mother expressed constant fear following the suspect's erroneous release.</p>

          <p>Following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, the monthly cost for a $40,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. At an average rate of 7.88%, a 10-year HELOC would cost about $482.78 per month, and a 15-year HELOC around $379.49. These payments are significantly lower than earlier in 2025 or last fall. Further rate cuts are anticipated, potentially reducing costs even more without refinancing. Borrowers also have the option to make interest-only payments during the initial draw period, offering greater flexibility in managing their finances in the current economic climate.

          <p>The Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black is set to be a fiercely contested event, with strategic factors like fast starts, managing crowd noise, and captaincy decisions likely determining the winner. European captain Luke Donald aims to reverse the trend of dominant home victories, emphasizing the pivotal role of Friday's opening foursomes. The notoriously boisterous New York crowds are a significant challenge, with Europe preparing to "pacify" them. Experience is also key, with Europe holding an advantage in playing experience and past away-game wins.
