          <p>Jamie Overton, a fast bowler for England, will miss the remainder of the one-day international series against the West Indies due to a broken finger. The injury occurred when Overton attempted to catch a return during England's victory in the series opener at Edgbaston. The 31-year-old player is expected to be sidelined for approximately one month, causing him to also miss the three T20 matches against the West Indies. No replacement has been named for the second ODI in Cardiff, where England has the opportunity to secure the series.</p>

          <p>Jewish organizers are increasingly confronting the Trump administration's policies, arguing that the exploitation of antisemitism charges is being used to justify repressive measures. These Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are pushing back against what they see as the systematic exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel from the national conversation over antisemitism. They are organizing protests, writing letters, and lobbying legislators to denounce the administration's actions. As the US universities have become political battlefields, much Jewish organizing is happening on campuses and academic spaces.</p>

          <p>Denmark is raising its retirement age to 70, prompting discussions about whether the U.S. might follow suit. While some propose raising the U.S. retirement age to address Social Security's financial challenges, experts note that the U.S. has greater income inequality and differences in life expectancy than Denmark. Raising the retirement age could disproportionately harm lower-income individuals who already receive benefits for a shorter period of time. Furthermore, the long-term nature of such a change means it may not address the immediate funding needs of Social Security (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* argues that President Trump and the MAGA movement represent an anti-conservative force that disdains laws, procedures, and the Constitution. The article claims that Trump seeks to empower the federal government for his own purposes, leading to a "thugocracy." The author contends that the Republican Party, now controlled by Trump, has abandoned its former principles and embraced the abuse of power and vengeance. Despite these concerns, the author expresses hope that the courts and resistance to Trump will prevent a complete shift toward authoritarianism.</p>

Deportation fears are causing some to abandon their jobs or forgo legal recourse against wage theft. Experts warn that the situation is likely to worsen under the current administration, potentially leading to a crisis in elder care, while selective immigration policies may be needed to address the country's economic and social needs.</p>

          <p>Governments can suppress free speech through indirect methods such as conditioning benefits on institutions altering their advocacy, intimidating speakers into self-censorship, and shaping government speech to promote official ideology. The Trump administration has used these tactics, including withholding funding from universities that embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or that, by the administration’s account, have fomented or tolerated antisemitism. The mechanisms of chilling speech make it hard to detect, but the current public climate strongly suggests that the Trump administration has dialed down the thermostat.

          <p>Despite President Trump's tough stance on drug dealers and the U.S. drug war, he has pardoned several convicted drug offenders, including Larry Hoover, a leader of the Gangster Disciples. These pardons have drawn criticism, with some experts pointing out the mixed messages being sent by the White House. While Trump has called for harsher penalties, he has also granted clemency to individuals with extensive criminal records. Some critics view these pardons as transactional, influenced by powerful figures, while others cautiously praise the decisions as a step toward addressing the harms of drug criminalization.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has warned that Gaza is the "hungriest place on Earth," with its entire population at risk of famine. The UN is calling on Israel to halt its campaign of deliberate starvation and allow food into the besieged enclave. Aid operations are being obstructed, and essential food is not reaching those in need. The UN has criticized the type of aid being allowed into Gaza, noting that it does not amount to a complete diet, and the UN special rapporteur on the right to food described the GHF as a “bait to corral people” which “violates every principle of international law”.</p>
