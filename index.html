          <p>Amazon sellers have significantly raised prices on nearly 1,000 products, averaging a 30% increase, primarily due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, impacting items from tech accessories to clothing. Importers are passing tariff costs to consumers, and even Chinese e-commerce sites like Shein and Temu have announced price hikes after the U.S. closed a duty-free loophole. While Trump claims negotiations could lower tariffs, Chinese officials deny ongoing talks, causing uncertainty for businesses planning supply chains amidst fluctuating tariff rates. This illustrates the immediate financial strain on consumers due to the ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI for allegedly obstructing an ICE task force from arresting an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, in her courtroom. The complaint alleges Dugan directed officers away from Flores-Ruiz, who was in court for a domestic abuse case, and escorted him through a non-public area, enabling him to initially evade arrest. Dugan's attorney protests the arrest, while the mayor criticizes the FBI's actions as a "show of force"; Dugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted.

          <p>President Trump's attempts to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine are being tested as President Putin launched airstrikes on Kyiv, despite Trump's direct plea to "stop" the bombing. Trump maintains that a peace deal is "very probable" and aims to save lives, while acknowledging his earlier claims of a 24-hour resolution were an exaggeration. Experts remain skeptical, with one suggesting the U.S. should either entice Russia with trade deals, rearm Ukraine to increase pressure, or withdraw and allow Europe to manage the conflict. Ambassador Witkoff is in Russia to meet with Putin as part of President Trump's efforts to make peace.</p>

          <p>The FBI arrested Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing federal agents attempting to arrest an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, in her courtroom, marking an escalation in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts. Dugan is accused of misdirecting agents and escorting Flores-Ruiz to a non-public area of the courthouse, after learning that ICE agents were waiting in the hallway to arrest Flores-Ruiz after a hearing in his criminal battery case. FBI Director Kash Patel stated that Dugan's actions endangered the public, as Flores-Ruiz initially evaded capture. Dugan has been released on bond and is scheduled for arraignment on May 15.</p>

          <p>Federal employees at the Commerce Department who were fired, rehired, and then fired again during the Trump administration are facing significant confusion and potential loss of health insurance coverage. After being initially terminated, employees were reinstated due to a court order, leading them to believe their benefits were restored; however, a subsequent court decision resulted in their re-termination, retroactively impacting their health insurance coverage. Employees are struggling to get clear information from Human Resources, with some facing potential medical bills that may not be reimbursed, and others delaying medical care due to the uncertainty. The situation highlights the chaos and instability caused by the administration's approach to federal employment and its impact on workers' benefits.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty in federal court to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, potentially facing the death penalty if convicted. The Justice Department argues that Thompson's killing was ideologically motivated by Mangione's anger toward the health insurance industry, demonstrating substantial planning and premeditation. Mangione's lawyers have requested the judge to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, claiming it violates his rights, and the judge has cautioned lawyers against public commentary that could impede Mangione's right to a fair trial. Mangione is separately charged in New York state court with the slaying, adding to the legal complexities of the case.</p>

George Santos was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, with the judge rebuking Santos for his repeated lies and lack of remorse.

          <p>The Chinese government is considering tariff exemptions on some essential U.S. imports, particularly in sectors crucial to supply chains and vulnerable to China's retaliatory tariffs. Officials from China’s commerce ministry are assessing which imports from the United States are vital, with health care products being a key area of concern. Some companies have warned that a prolonged tariff war could make their business models unsustainable in China, potentially leading to exits; China is trying to foster foreign direct investment. The consideration of exemptions suggests a nuanced approach to the trade war, balancing economic retaliation with maintaining critical supply lines.</p>

A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies of Ozempic and Wegovy while a legal challenge over the shortage of those drugs unfolds. The FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient. This decision upholds the FDA's determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over.</p>

          <p>Stars from the reality television show *Love On The Spectrum* are pushing back against Robert F Kennedy Jr's comments that people with autism make limited contributions to society. Kennedy, now the US Health and Human Services chief, stated that people with autism "will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date". The reality TV stars have called Kennedy's comments "completely false" and say the remarks were "extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive". Advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion while some parents feel Kennedy's comments resonate "with their lived experience".</p>

          <p>Members of an organised crime group have been sentenced for their part in a prostitution ring trafficking women into the UK from Romania. The nationwide enterprise saw 14 women aged in their 20s and 30s being brought in as sex workers in South Yorkshire, London and Norfolk. The women were advertised online and driven to locations to meet clients, with payments made to those running the network. The nature of the women's work left them open to physical and sexual abuse, the court heard.</p>

          <p>MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell reported that President Donald Trump is struggling with core economic issues, leading to a decline in his approval ratings, including among Trump voters. O'Donnell cited polls showing a significant drop in Trump's approval on the economy, attributing it to economic instability caused by tariffs and trade wars. He argued that swing voters who previously supported Trump have now turned against him, potentially jeopardizing Republican lawmakers' reelection prospects. This shift in voter sentiment could lead to GOP lawmakers abandoning Trump as they face difficult reelection battles, impacting the overall political landscape.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has signaled eagerness to reach a trade agreement with China, but China denies negotiations are underway and believes it has the upper hand. China's advantage stems from its relative independence from US trade, its ability to manage domestic demand, and the lack of allied support for Trump's trade war. China's control over rare earth minerals, essential for US manufacturing, further strengthens its position. Trump's trade war is facing political backlash in the US, potentially jeopardizing the GOP's control of Congress, making China less pressured to negotiate.</p>

          <p>As federal student loan collections resume, borrowers face the potential for garnishment of federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits. Social Security recipients may see up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced, while wages can be garnished up to 15% without a court order. Borrowers can avoid collection activity by taking steps to get out of default, such as enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation. Experts advise borrowers to request a retroactive forbearance to cover missed payments and a temporary forbearance until they can enroll in an income-driven repayment plan.</p>

Environmental advocates argue that the expedited procedures will strip away community input and harm public land and water sources, potentially leading to legal challenges.
