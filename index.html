          <p>Baltimore Ravens tight end Mark Andrews addressed the media regarding his crucial drop in the playoff game against the Buffalo Bills. Andrews expressed his disappointment and took responsibility for failing to secure the catch, which would have tied the game.

          <p>Trump's trade policies and comments have sparked a sense of Canadian patriotism, even among Quebec sovereigntists. Voters are prioritizing a strong federal government to counter potential threats from the US. This has led to a shift in voting intentions, with some Quebecers abandoning smaller parties to support the Liberals, who are seen as best equipped to handle the challenges posed by the US. The tariffs are expected to negatively impact Quebec's economy.</p>
