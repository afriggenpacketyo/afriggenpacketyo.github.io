            <h2>Belichick Expresses Regret Over Missed Opportunity to Draft Lamar Jackson</h2>

            <p>In his new book, Bill Belichick reflects on his time with the New England Patriots, specifically regretting not drafting Lamar Jackson. Belichick admits he passed on Jackson twice, once to draft Isaiah Wynn and again to draft Sony Michel. He acknowledges that while Michel contributed to a Super Bowl win, the team needed to think about the future at the quarterback position, especially with Brady's age. Belichick's regret highlights the Patriots' failure to secure a long-term successor to Tom Brady, leading to a period of decline after Brady's departure. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are creating panic buying and paralysis among consumers. Initial tariffs led to concerns about price increases and potential shortages, prompting some to stock up on goods. However, subsequent exemptions, like those for smartphones, have left consumers confused and uncertain about future costs. The tariffs are expected to significantly increase costs for American families, potentially leading to reduced consumer spending and economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from recently imposed tariffs, including those on Chinese imports. This decision follows concerns from U.S. tech companies about potential price increases on gadgets. The White House stated the exemptions aim to provide companies with more time to shift production to the U.S., although the goods remain subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl. Some analysts predict that this move will allow tech investors to 'breathe a huge sigh of relief'. (not investment advice)</p>

This action is seen as an attempt to silence dissent and enforce conformity, raising concerns about the suppression of free thinking and open debate.
