          <p>The UK government is organizing a chartered flight from Tel Aviv to evacuate vulnerable British nationals and their dependents from Israel due to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) is advising against all travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, citing the volatile security situation. While priority will be given to vulnerable individuals, available seats will be allocated based on need, with further flights being considered depending on demand and the evolving security landscape. Other countries, including India, the US, and China, have also initiated evacuation plans for their citizens amidst the rising conflict. The UK government is prioritizing the safety of its citizens in the region. The overall stability of the region is uncertain at this time.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a missile barrage on Israel, impacting multiple cities and wounding at least 21 people, according to Israeli emergency services. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that approximately 30 missiles were launched, with some causing significant damage to buildings and resulting in ongoing search and rescue operations. The Iranian assault occurred hours after President Trump announced U.S. military strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites: Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo. The IDF is investigating a potential issue with its missile defense interceptor system, as no alert sirens were activated in Haifa despite a missile impact. The rising tensions between the two countries are a serious concern.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 10:04:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert recommends avoiding phrases that trigger a child's fight-or-flight response and instead using language that fosters cooperation. Traditional phrases like "Because I said so" or threats are discouraged in favor of explanations, empathy, and problem-solving. The expert suggests alternatives that respect a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, such as explaining decisions, acknowledging emotions, and inviting problem-solving. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, leading to emotionally resilient adults. These communication shifts can improve parent-child dynamics.</p>

          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System has issued a bulletin warning of a heightened threat environment in the United States following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. While there are no specific, credible threats at this time, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks by cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government. The advisory also notes the potential for violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to be motivated by the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. Law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots in the U.S. since 2020, underscoring the need for continued vigilance. The potential for domestic unrest is elevated.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials have provided details on the U.S. operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, describing it as the largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history. The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, requiring multiple in-flight refuelings and coordination with fighter jets and support aircraft. The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, utilizing bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Despite the complexity of the operation, Iranian forces did not engage, and initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites. The U.S. has warned Iran against retaliatory action. The operation was deemed a success by the Defense Secretary.</p>

The organization anticipates that U.S. warships and merchant ships affiliated with Israel or the U.S. are likely targets for Iran and Houthi rebels. Maersk has already temporarily suspended port calls to Haifa, Israel's largest container port. Disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, could significantly impact global energy prices and supply chains. The conflict has led to a surge in ocean freight rates from Shanghai to the Arabian Gulf. These factors present potential difficulties for shipping companies.</p>

          <p>Verbal jousting and psychological tactics have begun ahead of the British and Irish Lions 2025 tour, with Wallaby coach Joe Schmidt and Lions general manager David Nucifora exchanging barbs. The article highlights the historical context of mind games on Lions tours, dating back to 1896 in South Africa. Nucifora called Schmidt a "deep thinker" and suggested that he might overthink things to his detriment. Schmidt subtly questioned the number of foreign-born players in the Lions squad. The tradition of psychological warfare is part of the tour.</p>

          <p>Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine told reporters that overnight US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had included 14 massive ordnance penetrator or "bunker-buster" bombs, more than two dozen Tomahawk missiles and over 125 military aircraft. Caine called "Operation Midnight Hammer" the largest B-2 operational strike in US history, explaining that seven B-2 stealth bombers had flown 18 hours from the US mainland to Iran and refueled mid-air several times along the way to carry out the mission. Despite claims from President Trump and Secretary of Defense Hegseth that Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated", Caine said a battle damage assessment was still ongoing. The US troops had used deceptive tactics and completed their mission of delivering some 75 precision-guided weapons to targets inside Iran undetected.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump says the US has carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran and said they have been "obliterated". Israel says they were in "full co-ordination" with the US in planning the strikes. US Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 US military aircraft including seven B-2 stealth bombers. One of the targets was Fordo - a uranium enrichment plant hidden in a remote mountainside that is vital to Iran's nuclear ambitions. Within the hours of the US bombing, Iran launched a fresh barrage of missiles which hit parts of Tel Aviv and Haifa, and the strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel.</p>
