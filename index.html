          <p>Canada's Prime Minister announced the country will recognize Palestine as a state at the UN General Assembly in September, following similar moves by the UK and France. The recognition is conditioned on the Palestinian Authority implementing significant reforms, including holding elections without Hamas's involvement and demilitarizing the future state. The decision has drawn criticism from Israel, which described it as a "reward for Hamas" that undermines efforts for a ceasefire and hostage release. This policy shift reflects growing international pressure regarding the conflict and the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A group of twelve Democratic members of Congress has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is illegally limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. The lawsuit claims the Department of Homeland Security is violating federal law that guarantees congressional oversight access to these facilities. The complaint follows several instances where lawmakers were denied entry or faced delays, which they argue inhibits their ability to monitor conditions for detainees. The administration maintains it now requires a week's notice for such visits, citing the president's authority to oversee the executive branch.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves across the Pacific. The event prompted evacuation orders and warnings in Hawaii, Japan, and along the U.S. West Coast, though these were later downgraded to advisories as the most severe risks passed. While Russia experienced flooding from waves up to 16 feet, major damage and casualties were largely avoided in other regions due to the tsunami's trajectory. The incident caused significant, albeit temporary, disruption, with officials urging caution as dangerous currents could persist for hours.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee announced its decision to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The committee cited ongoing economic uncertainty and inflation that remains above the 2% target as key reasons for its "wait-and-see" approach. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated the economy remains in good shape and is not being unduly held back by current policy, though he acknowledged risks from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a 3% annualized growth rate in the second quarter, a significant rebound from the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of 2025. This growth surpassed economists' forecasts and was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, which is linked to the Trump administration's trade policies. While the headline number appears strong, some economists caution that it may overstate the economy's underlying health, as a key measure of private domestic demand showed weak growth. The report suggests the economy is slowing but not reversing, with consumer spending showing modest improvement. (not investment advice)</p>

The move, prompted by Donald Trump, aims to create more GOP-leaning districts and has led Democratic leaders in states like California and Illinois to threaten retaliatory gerrymandering. This tit-for-tat escalation could lead to a 'race to the bottom,' where congressional maps are redrawn every two years, eroding voter trust and institutional faith.

          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little widespread damage. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into an open, unpopulated stretch of the Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii. This trajectory allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated coastlines like the U.S. West Coast. While the immediate area near the epicenter in Russia saw damaging waves, experts consider it a 'best-case scenario' for a distant tsunami, highlighting how location and directionality are critical factors in determining a tsunami's impact.</p>

Series like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" utilize hyperrealistic filmmaking and real-time tension to immerse viewers in high-stress environments, a formula that has resonated and earned critical acclaim. Psychologists suggest that watching such shows can create a form of "vicarious stress" that is engaging because it's relatable and risk-free.

          <h2>Freed Israeli Hostage Criticizes UK Plan to Recognize Palestinian State</h2>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has criticized the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing the move "risks rewarding terror." Doron Katz-Asher, who was freed from captivity, stated that making recognition conditional on a ceasefire could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages. Her statement, echoed by lawyers for other British hostage families, expresses deep concern that the policy could prolong the conflict rather than promote peace. The criticism adds a personal and poignant perspective to the diplomatic initiatives recently announced by the UK, France, and Canada.</p>

          <p>A technical issue at the UK's national air traffic control service (NATS) caused significant flight disruptions, grounding thousands of planes and leading to over 150 cancellations. The "radar-related" problem at the Swanwick control center lasted only 20 minutes but created a massive backlog at major airports including Heathrow, Manchester, and Edinburgh. NATS apologized for the outage, stating it switched to a backup system and reduced flight traffic to ensure safety, with no evidence of a cyberattack. This marks the second major NATS outage in two years, prompting criticism and calls for a government investigation.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that as the United States pivots its energy policy to prioritize fossil fuels and nuclear power, it risks ceding leadership in the global renewables race to China. The article highlights that recent U.S. legislation aims to secure energy independence by addressing supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly China's dominance in critical minerals and clean tech manufacturing. However, critics argue this approach prioritizes short-term security over long-term sustainability and competitiveness. This strategic divergence could allow Beijing to solidify its advantage in the clean energy transition, impacting both geopolitical leverage and global climate goals.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Texas have unveiled a proposed new congressional map that could give the party up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. The aggressive gerrymander, drawn during a special session called by the governor at Donald Trump's urging, has been denounced by Democrats as a racially discriminatory power grab. The map consolidates Democratic districts in Austin, radically redraws lines in Houston, and shores up Republican chances in competitive South Texas districts. The proposal is expected to face immediate and fierce legal challenges, though its fate before the 2026 elections remains uncertain.</p>
