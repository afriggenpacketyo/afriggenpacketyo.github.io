          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on stage 17 from Bollene to Valence. The final kilometers were marked by heavy rain and a crash that involved key sprinters Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay. Milan's win further solidified his lead in the points classification, extending his advantage for the green jersey. Race leader Tadej Pogacar finished safely with the main group, maintaining his significant overall lead in the general classification.</p>

          <p>U.S. Congressman Mike Lawler has confirmed he will seek reelection for his House seat in New York's 17th Congressional District, ending speculation about a potential run for governor. Lawler stated his decision was based on the importance of maintaining the Republican House majority, where his competitive district plays a crucial role. The announcement reframes the potential 2026 Republican gubernatorial field, which may feature Rep. Elise Stefanik, who has received encouragement from former President Trump. The decision prompted sharp exchanges between Lawler and incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged 55-year-old Michael Gann with building and trying to detonate multiple homemade bombs in New York City. Gann allegedly used chemicals purchased online to create at least seven improvised explosive devices, storing some on residential rooftops in SoHo and throwing one onto subway tracks. Although no injuries occurred, officials highlighted the significant danger, noting one device contained material far exceeding legal firework limits. If convicted on all counts, including transporting explosives and attempted destruction of property, he faces a potential 40-year prison sentence.</p>

The National Association of Realtors argues that the current tax, which applies to profits over $250,000 for individuals, discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling and downsizing. However, some analysts contend that such a change would primarily benefit high-end homeowners and would not address the core housing market problems of low inventory and lack of confidence.

          <p>A closer look at the announcement of the U.S.-Japan trade deal reveals inconsistencies and last-minute edits on President Trump's briefing card. A photo showed the card with a "10%" tariff rate, while a separate 15% rate was specified for certain industries, and a "$400B" investment figure was crossed out and replaced with "500". However, Trump's public announcement mentioned only a 15% tariff and a $550 billion investment, creating confusion on Wall Street about the deal's precise terms. The discrepancies highlight the fluid nature of the negotiations and have led to questions about the final details of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

The ASA ordered that the ad must not appear again in its current form and that M&S must ensure future imagery does not portray unhealthy body images.

          <p>This article offers advice for homeowners who are struggling to qualify for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) amid rising interest rates and tighter lending standards. Experts suggest that the primary reasons for denial often include high debt-to-income ratios, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. To improve approval odds, they recommend asking the lender for the specific reason for denial, working to boost one's credit score, and reducing overall debt. The article also explores alternative financing options, such as home equity loans, cash-out refinances, or personal loans, for those who cannot secure a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, two former traders jailed in the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal, have had their convictions quashed by the UK Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled that errors in the jury directions during their original trials made the convictions "unsafe." The men had long argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the case, announced it would not seek a retrial, potentially opening the door for other convicted traders to appeal.</p>

The system works by drawing on a massive database of 176,000 known inscriptions to find relevant parallels, a process that would take a human scholar years. While AI is not a replacement for human expertise, tests showed that historians working in conjunction with Aeneas produced more accurate results than either could alone.

The author points to Trump's denial of writing in Epstein's scrapbook, his attempts to kill the story, and his efforts to deflect questions by attacking political opponents and reviving old conspiracies. The article suggests that by comparing the Epstein matter to other "witch hunts" where he has a documented record of falsehoods, Trump is acting in a manner that seems more consistent with guilt than with innocence, further fueling suspicion about what he might be hiding.</p>
