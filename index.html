        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices, experiencing rapid growth due to the ultra-rich seeking personalized wealth management, are struggling to find qualified money managers, facing a talent crunch intensified by trust issues and competition from banks and private equity firms. According to Deloitte, there were 8,030 family offices globally managing $3.1 trillion in assets as of last September, and this number is expected to grow significantly by 2030. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, seeking individuals with lifelong relationships with the family, and are willing to pay a premium for trusted advisors. Young employees are also reluctant to work at family offices due to unclear corporate structures and the perception of it being a 'retirement job'. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to weaken limits on some "forever chemicals" (PFAS) in drinking water that were finalized the previous year, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS.

          <p>A new report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and what they need to maintain a basic standard of living is widening. The analysis considers costs beyond daily necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare, revealing that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The report highlights that while traditional economic indicators show a thriving economy, they do not reflect the lived reality for many Americans, and the cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001.</p>

          <p>Many girls in Sri Lanka's hill country are forced to miss school due to period poverty, lacking access to affordable sanitary pads. A survey indicated that nearly half of the girls struggled to afford pads each month, impacting their school performance and leading to feelings of shame. While the government has initiated voucher programs, they are insufficient to meet the ongoing need, and some girls resort to using unsafe cloth pads, leading to infections. The lack of proper disposal facilities and awareness further exacerbates the problem.</p>

          <p>Grigory Melkonyants, head of Russia’s only independent election watchdog, Golos, was sentenced to five years in prison for working with an “undesirable organization.” The charges relate to Golos's past affiliation with the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, which the Russian authorities declared “undesirable” in 2021. The conviction has been criticized as politically motivated, reflecting a broader crackdown on dissent in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Human rights organizations have condemned the verdict, calling for the conviction to be quashed.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade policies, particularly tariffs on imported cars, are leaving a lasting impact on the German auto industry and other manufacturers. The unpredictability of these policies creates uncertainty for businesses needing long-term planning. Some German carmakers are considering moving production to the US to avoid high tariffs, but even US car production relies on imported parts. The article suggests that German carmakers need new strategies, such as geographic diversification of production and a focus on Asian markets.</p>

          <p>Israel attempted to assassinate Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, but the long-term strategic significance is uncertain. While his death would be a tactical success, Hamas has survived for decades despite Israel’s systematic assassination of its leaders. Analysts suggest that even without Sinwar, Hamas’s strategic outlook and operational abilities may not change significantly, and the war's trajectory depends as much on Israel's approach as it does on Hamas.</p>
