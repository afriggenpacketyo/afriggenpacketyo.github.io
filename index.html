          <h2>Starmer's Stance on Transgender Women Clarified by No. 10</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 16:09:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson stated that Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, aligning with the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' under the Equality Act as biological. This statement marks a shift from Starmer's previous stance in 2022, when he said trans women are women. The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the Labour government of reversing course on the issue, while Labour ministers welcome the clarity of the ruling, emphasizing the protection of single-sex spaces based on biological sex. The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to use women-only spaces if deemed disproportionate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged, reclaiming the $90,000 level for the first time since March, driven by investors seeking an alternative to volatile stock markets and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's decoupling from traditional risk assets has been notable, surpassing gold's gains in April. This rise occurs amidst political pressure on the Federal Reserve and ongoing market turbulence, with U.S. Bitcoin ETFs experiencing significant inflows. While analysts note the positive decoupling, they caution that low trading volumes may limit further gains without a significant catalyst such as Fed easing or tariff deals.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a "reorganization" of the State Department, involving staffing cuts and consolidation of domestic offices, aiming to address what he calls a "bloated" and inefficient bureaucracy. The plan entails undersecretaries presenting plans to eliminate positions, with proposed cuts affecting offices related to human rights, democracy, and war crimes prevention. Rubio argues the current system is more aligned with radical political ideology than America's core national interests. The changes are described as purely domestic, with the State Department assuming responsibility for remaining humanitarian assistance programming and most USAID functions.</p>

          <p>Six leading automotive industry groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider impending 25% tariffs on auto parts, warning of potential damage to U.S. automotive production. The groups, representing automakers, suppliers, and dealers, argue that many suppliers are already financially strained and unable to absorb additional costs, which could lead to production shutdowns and job losses. They emphasize the automotive sector's significant contribution to the U.S. economy, supporting 10 million jobs and generating $1.2 trillion annually. The letter follows President Trump's indication that he may offer assistance to auto companies needing time to adjust to new sourcing requirements.</p>

He hopes that winning will repair the relationship with fans next season, but Doncic expressed disappointment with Harrison's comments about the trade.

          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decline by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's tariffs on China, which may cause China-linked retailers like Temu and Shien to reduce their Facebook and Instagram ad spending. Meta's China revenue was $18.35 billion in 2024, representing over 11% of its total sales. Analysts believe that Temu and Shien comprise the bulk of Meta's China business, and a pullback in ad spending from these retailers could significantly impact Meta's 2025 ad sales. A broader recession, combined with the U.S. and China trade dispute, could further exacerbate the situation, potentially wiping $23 billion in advertising revenues off Meta's books.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Manhattan found the New York Times not liable for allegedly defaming Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial about gun control, marking a second loss for Palin at trial. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial that wrongly linked Palin's political action committee to a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona. The Times quickly acknowledged the mistake and issued a correction, but Palin argued it was insufficient. The case was viewed as a potential challenge to the 1964 Supreme Court decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, requiring public figures to prove "actual malice" in defamation cases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers poses a risk to the U.S. economy, according to experts. Beginning in May, roughly 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections, potentially leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. This added financial pressure comes at a time when the U.S. faces an elevated risk of recession and consumer sentiment is already strained. While the policy may clarify the path forward for loan payments, it could also damage borrowers' credit scores and hinder their ability to make major purchases.</p>

          <p>Housing construction in Los Angeles experienced a significant decline in the first quarter of 2025, with permit applications for new homes down nearly 57% compared to the previous year. The drop is attributed to factors such as high interest rates, tariffs, economic uncertainty, and the city's transfer tax, Measure ULA. The January wildfires also likely contributed to the decline by disrupting business operations. This pullback in housing development could exacerbate the city's affordability crisis and impact tax revenue, potentially worsening the city's budget challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a major overhaul of the State Department, which includes eliminating over 100 bureaus and offices and reducing staff by 15%. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the restructure is designed to eliminate offices "misaligned with America's core national interests." The cuts include the Office of Global Criminal Justice, which helps set policy on the US response to war crimes and genocide. Critics argue the changes reflect a broader effort to dismantle the federal government and silence dissenting voices, while officials say the changes will streamline operations and improve efficiency.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could severely impact the global economy, potentially triggering a trade war. The IMF has lowered its global growth forecast for the year, citing the surge in policy uncertainty caused by the tariffs. Concerns are rising that foreign investors may reduce their exposure to the U.S., and that countries targeted by Trump will retaliate with their own tariffs. While Trump has temporarily paused most reciprocal tariffs, the situation remains volatile and could lead to more widespread economic tensions.</p>

Milei's recent bold move was ending the so-called "cepo" restrictions — which had restricted access to US dollars for over two decades. While some economists see him as a reformer liberating Argentina from bureaucracy and rigid controls, others criticize his policies for causing social hardship. There are some early signs of success. According to Argentina's national statistics agency INDEC, poverty has dropped to 38.1% — slightly below the level Milei inherited. Inflation also decreased by 44.5% year-on-year in 2024, INDEC data shows.</p>
