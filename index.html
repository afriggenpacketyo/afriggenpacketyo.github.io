          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea taking down some of its propaganda loudspeakers along their shared border. This action follows South Korea's own removal of speakers, a move initiated by the new liberal government to de-escalate tensions. The psychological warfare, which included blasting K-pop and critical messages, has been a significant source of friction between the two nations. These developments occur ahead of upcoming large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which could potentially reignite tensions in the region.</p>

The blaze, which started in Ventura County, is now 28% contained, though efforts are being hampered by a regional heat wave causing triple-digit temperatures. During the firefighting operations, a Kern County Fire Department Battalion Chief was seriously injured when his vehicle rolled over. The cause of the fire remains under investigation as crews work to secure the perimeter and manage hotspots.</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers were wounded by a landmine along the tense border with Cambodia, with one sustaining a severe leg injury. The incident occurred just days after the two nations agreed to extend a ceasefire, which had ended their deadliest clashes in decades. Thailand accused Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention by laying new mines, a claim Cambodia denies, stating the mines are likely remnants of past conflicts. This event complicates recent diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve long-running border disputes over ancient temples.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested at least 365 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a recently proscribed organization. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw attendees simultaneously display signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action." The government banned the group under the Terrorism Act, making public support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Protesters stated they were acting against what they see as government overreach and in solidarity with the Palestinian cause.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel has created a significant rift within his own conservative CDU/CSU political alliance. Critics, including the CSU parliamentary group leader, argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing foreign policy and special responsibility toward Israel. However, the decision has also received support from other prominent conservatives and coalition partners like the Social Democrats, who cite concerns over the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The controversy highlights deep divisions over foreign policy and Germany's historical commitments.</p>

          <p>A shooting incident near the Emory University campus and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta has left two people dead. The deceased are DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, 33, and the suspected gunman, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White. Investigators are reportedly exploring theories that the suspect believed he was ill from a COVID-19 vaccine. The attack prompted a campus-wide lockdown as gunfire struck at least four CDC buildings, though no CDC employees were harmed.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of modern partisan gerrymandering, tracing its roots to the Republican "Redmap" project after the 2008 election. The strategy involved targeting and winning key state legislative races ahead of the 2010 census to gain control of the redistricting process. This allowed the GOP to draw congressional and state-level maps that locked in their power for a decade, often in states where they did not win the popular vote. The use of advanced data and mapping software transformed redistricting and has had a profound, lasting impact on American political representation.</p>

Leaders like DNC chair Ken Martin have stated the party will now "bring a knife to a knife fight," a departure from Michelle Obama's "when they go low, we go high" motto. This new approach includes Democratic governors in states like California and New York threatening retaliatory redistricting. The move reflects a growing sentiment within the party that they must fight aggressively to counter what they see as authoritarian tactics.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers secured a 99-year ground lease for the site of the former St. John's College, which had been deteriorating for decades. The $104 million project preserved many of the building's historic architectural elements while adding modern amenities and a new wing. Of the 205 units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, with market-rate rents ranging from approximately $3,100 to $6,950 per month.</p>

          <p>Several German cities have offered to accept and provide medical care for seriously ill or traumatized children from Gaza, but the federal government is reluctant to approve the plan. Officials from the Interior and Foreign ministries have cited security concerns and stated their focus remains on providing aid within the region. The hesitation has drawn criticism from opposition parties and the mayors who made the offer, pointing to past programs for injured Ukrainians and Yazidis. Conservative politicians have expressed fears that the initiative could trigger a new wave of immigration, revealing deep political divisions.</p>

          <p>According to nutrition experts, specific foods can provide key nutrients to support skin health and maintain a youthful appearance. Foods rich in vitamin C, like sweet potatoes and orange juice, are recommended for promoting collagen synthesis, which helps keep skin firm. Edamame contains isoflavones that may reduce wrinkles, while the lycopene in tomatoes can protect against sun damage. Additionally, the omega-3 fatty acids in salmon, the zinc in pumpkin seeds, and the probiotics in kefir all contribute to skin hydration, healing, and protection.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the famous "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has new advice for today's retirees. He argues that due to better portfolio diversification, many retirees can safely withdraw more, suggesting a rate closer to 5.25% to 5.5% for current retirees. His original research in the 1990s established 4.15% as a conservative baseline for a 30-year retirement, but he has since refined his model. Bengen emphasizes that inflation is the greatest enemy of retirees and that his original number represented a worst-case scenario. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" analyzed the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, noting it marks a significant shift from the previous "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine" policy. Panelists observed that by engaging in direct negotiations with Russia, the Trump administration is effectively marginalizing Kyiv in discussions about its own future. This places Ukraine in a highly vulnerable position, having its sovereignty undermined first by the war and now by diplomatic maneuvers. The discussion also touched on the lack of a clear governing theory behind President Trump's broader global tariff policies.</p>

According to Bloomberg News, the funds are intended to establish a public company that will hold the venture's WLFI tokens.

The WLFI tokens are not classified as securities by the SEC, meaning they are not subject to the same level of regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>
