        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's readiness to allow TikTok to be banned in the United States was the crucial factor that prompted China to negotiate a deal. Bessent stated that Trump's firm stance on prioritizing national security over the deal's finalization effectively shifted the dynamics of the talks. The parent company, ByteDance, faces a looming deadline to divest the app's U.S. operations. Bessent mentioned that while commercial terms had been largely settled for months, geopolitical tensions, including U.S. tariffs, had previously stalled the agreement's progress.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has commenced a large-scale ground offensive in Gaza City, described by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an operation against Hamas's final major stronghold. The assault, which includes intense airstrikes, has forced tens of thousands of Palestinians to flee south along a single coastal road, exacerbating an already severe humanitarian crisis. This military action has drawn sharp international condemnation, including from the UK and the UN, which recently released a report accusing Israel of committing genocide. The Israel Defense Forces have urged all remaining civilians to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz gave an emotional address at the reopening of a historic synagogue in Munich, emphasizing the resurgence of Jewish life in Germany while acknowledging the persistent threat of antisemitism. Visibly moved, Merz spoke of the shame he feels over the necessity of police protection for Jewish institutions, from schools to cafes, across the country. He highlighted that the 75th anniversary of the Central Council of Jews in Germany occurs amid a new wave of antisemitism, particularly following the October 7th Hamas attack, making it challenging for Jews to openly express their identity in some areas.</p>

          <p>A senior Labour MP, Dame Emily Thornberry, stated that significant "red flags were missed or ignored" regarding Peter Mandelson's appointment as UK ambassador to the US, following his dismissal over links to Jeffrey Epstein. During an emergency debate, Thornberry criticized the vetting process, questioning how Mandelson's known relationship with the convicted sex offender was overlooked by the Cabinet Office and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Foreign Secretary indicated her department was not asked to contribute to the due diligence process, placing responsibility on No 10. The opposition has heavily criticized Starmer for the appointment and for not attending the debate.</p>

The three individuals, who claim ancestral rights to the land, promptly moved their belongings and set up a new camp just meters away on an adjacent plot. This action followed a court order issued after the group ignored previous requests to leave.

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions that were imposed on certain Hungarian citizens, signaling a warming of diplomatic relations between Washington and Budapest. The previous restrictions, enacted by the Biden administration in 2021, had targeted Hungarian passport holders born outside the country due to security concerns over a simplified naturalization process. These measures reduced the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program. The restoration of the standard two-year validity period follows actions taken by Hungary to address the security vulnerabilities that led to the initial sanctions.</p>

During a pre-trial hearing, Judge Gregory Carro ruled that the charges were legally insufficient, stating there was no evidence of a desire to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence. Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder and multiple weapons offenses, in addition to separate federal charges. The judge has not yet ruled on defense motions to suppress evidence obtained from Mangione's backpack.</p>

The incident is being contrasted with the extensive security preparations, including dozens of officers and drone surveillance, deployed for a Kirk event in California just weeks earlier. Only six campus police officers were assigned to the UVU event, where the shooter attacked from an elevated position, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in securing outdoor venues for high-profile figures.</p>

          <p>With average mortgage rates recently dropping to their lowest point since October 2024, many homeowners are considering refinancing. Financial experts suggest that individuals with current mortgage rates above 7% should begin exploring their options, as today's average 30-year refinance rates are around 6.72%. The decision to refinance should be based on personal financial needs, such as improving cash flow or consolidating high-interest debt like credit cards. While waiting could potentially secure even lower rates later in the year, experts warn there's an opportunity cost, as homeowners continue paying higher interest in the interim.

The service marked the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in modern times and included a message from the Pope praising the duchess's dedication to charity. The duchess, who died at 92, was remembered for her kindness, love of music, and volunteer work with the homeless.</p>

The Virginia site will specialize in developing active ingredients for complex medicines, including antibody drug conjugates, and will create over 650 new jobs.

          <p>China has launched a new Global Governance Initiative (GGI), presenting its most detailed vision yet for reshaping the international system. The initiative, introduced to mark the UN's 80th anniversary, emphasizes inclusive multilateralism and sovereign equality, contrasting with what Beijing views as the United States' unilateral and transactional approach to diplomacy. Experts suggest the GGI reflects China's ambition to foster a multipolar world where developing nations have a greater voice in global decision-making. The move comes at a time of increasing skepticism about the effectiveness and credibility of the current US-led global framework.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has launched an investigation into suspected lobbying efforts by the fossil fuel industry that may have influenced the Trump administration's decision to rescind a critical climate regulation. The 2009 "endangerment finding," which classifies greenhouse gases as harmful pollutants, is the legal foundation for most U.S. climate rules. The Senate environment and public works committee has sent letters to two dozen entities, including oil giants like Exxon and Chevron, requesting documents related to their communications about the finding.

In a key frontal crash simulation, the BMW i4, Chevrolet Blazer EV, Tesla Cybertruck, and Volkswagen ID.Buzz all earned top ratings. However, the Ford F-150 Lightning received a poor rating due to a high risk of chest, head, or neck injuries for rear-seat passengers. The Nissan Ariya was rated marginal for similar chest injury risks. Most vehicles performed well in pedestrian crash avoidance tests, but headlight performance was inconsistent across the models.</p>

He contrasted this with the company's decision to build a new $5 billion manufacturing plant in Virginia, highlighting that capital flows to where it is wanted.

For India, an FTA would provide crucial tariff-free access for its exports, while the EU aims to strengthen its supply chains and geopolitical presence in the Indo-Pacific.

The election results are being interpreted by some as a litmus test for the national mood ahead of general elections scheduled for 2026.

This article provides a retrospective look at some of the most memorable of these visits, from Woodrow Wilson's post-WWI meeting with King George V to Joe Biden's 2021 visit with the late Queen Elizabeth II. These interactions have often reflected the 'special relationship' between the two nations, though they have also included moments of protocol breaches and political protests. For King Charles, this will be his first time hosting a U.S. president as monarch.</p>
