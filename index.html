          <p>According to U.S. intelligence sources cited by CBS News, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained injuries during a recent Israeli attack. The strike reportedly occurred while he was in a Supreme National Security Council meeting, causing leg injuries as he escaped. This event is part of a larger 12-day conflict that resulted in a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, during which several high-ranking Iranian commanders were also killed. The White House and Israeli government have not commented on the report.</p>

          <p>At President Trump's direction, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured Alcatraz Island to assess its feasibility for reopening as a high-security federal prison. The exclusive visit, covered by Fox News, is part of a fact-finding mission to determine if the crumbling infrastructure can be rehabilitated to house the "worst of the worst" offenders. While proponents see it as a powerful symbol of law and order, the plan faces significant logistical hurdles and criticism from California politicians who highlight the site's value as a major tourist attraction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. Following the recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove shoes during security checks, Noem stated she is questioning all current TSA procedures. The potential revision could change the long-standing 3.4-ounce limit, a rule implemented after a 2006 liquid explosives plot. While no specific details or timeline were provided, this review is part of a broader effort to streamline airport security processes.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, for a seat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 12-0 vote occurred after all Democratic members walked out in protest, angered by the refusal to delay the vote and hear testimony from a Justice Department whistleblower who has accused Bove of unethical conduct. Bove's nomination has been contentious due to these allegations and his past role in controversial Justice Department decisions, and his confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female members of Congress from both parties to compete against a team of journalists known as the "Bad News Babes." Unlike the partisan men's baseball game, this event fosters camaraderie while supporting a significant cause, the Young Survival Coalition, which aids young adults with breast cancer. The game was co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor, and has raised nearly $5 million for the charity over 17 years, offering a rare moment of unity in Washington.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely due to easing rice prices. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. The data comes as Japan faces economic growth concerns fueled by potential U.S. tariffs and a decline in first-quarter GDP. Analysts, however, suggest a rate hike is unlikely until early 2026, as inflation expectations remain below the target threshold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumers in the U.S. are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with the average cost of ground beef reaching $6.12 per pound in June. This price surge is driven by a long-term decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. With strong consumer demand for beef persisting, experts do not expect significant price relief in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a more than 8% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock price, CEO Robert Ford stated in a CNBC interview that he believes the market's reaction to the company's quarterly report was an overreaction. Although Abbott beat earnings and revenue expectations, investors were disappointed by the tightening of its full-year guidance, partly due to a weaker-than-expected diagnostics business in China. Ford emphasized that the fundamentals of the company remain strong, highlighting double-digit growth in its medical devices division and a robust generic pharmaceuticals business in emerging markets.

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has resolved his 2024 DUI case by pleading no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving." The former USC star, who was found asleep at the wheel of a Rolls-Royce near LAX, was sentenced to 12 months' probation and a fine, thereby avoiding jail time. His attorney stated that Addison accepted the plea deal to take responsibility and move past the incident. The NFL has stated that the matter remains under review, and Addison could still face a suspension under the league's substance abuse policy.</p>

In his reply, Powell directed critics to a new transparency page on the Fed's website and refuted accusations of luxurious amenities being added to the building. The inquiry is seen as part of a broader White House pressure campaign against Powell, whom President Trump has criticized for not lowering interest rates. Powell's response was measured and did not engage with the confrontational tone of the White House's letter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing mounting bipartisan pressure to release the complete Justice Department files on the Jeffrey Epstein case, a demand it has so far resisted. Attorney General Pam Bondi previously stated no "client list" exists, but many, including a majority of Trump's own supporters, want full transparency. The president has called the renewed interest a "hoax" and suggested any released material should be pre-screened for credibility. The issue has created a difficult situation for Republicans, as Democrats push for a vote to make the documents public amid ongoing public fascination and conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval of the measures due to concerns about a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received necessary guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including further isolating banks from the SWIFT system and targeting its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers.</p>

          <p>In a significant move, the Trump administration's Justice Department has recommended a sentence of just one day in prison for Brett Hankison, the former Louisville police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment building during the fatal 2020 raid. Because the DOJ memo also requests credit for time served, the sentence would mean Hankison serves no additional jail time. This recommendation is seen as a sign of the current administration's disinterest in police reform efforts.</p>

The lawsuit centered on Governor Ron DeSantis's move to dismantle a North Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their candidate of choice. The court's majority, led by a DeSantis appointee, ruled that while the new map diminishes minority voting power, it was not proven that a compliant district could be drawn without race being the predominant factor, a standard they claim would be unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic examines the Supreme Court's growing tendency to issue major rulings through its emergency or "shadow docket," often with little to no explanation. The Trump administration has aggressively used this path to seek relief from lower court rulings, and the Court's conservative majority has frequently obliged, allowing controversial policies to take effect while litigation continues. Legal experts express concern that this practice undermines the normal judicial process and the Court's own legitimacy, as it appears to be handing political victories to the administration without providing legal reasoning to the public.</p>
