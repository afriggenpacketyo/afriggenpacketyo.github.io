          <p>Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have put their National Guard troops on standby for the nationwide "No Kings" protests against Donald Trump's policies. Organizers anticipate gatherings at over 2,500 locations, building on a previous event in June that they claim drew over five million participants. The protests aim to challenge what organizers describe as Trump's "authoritarianism," while some Republican figures have labeled the events "Hate America" rallies and expressed doubts about them remaining peaceful. The activation of military personnel has drawn criticism from Democrats, who liken the move to tactics used by authoritarian regimes to suppress dissent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release after serving less than three months of a seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited Santos's courage to "ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!" and claimed he had been "horribly mistreated" in prison. The commutation, which removes all further fines and conditions, followed a public plea from Santos and lobbying from several Republican representatives. The decision has been sharply criticized by both Democrats and some New York Republicans who were instrumental in Santos's expulsion from Congress.</p>

          <p>A study in North America indicates that the Galleri blood test could significantly accelerate cancer diagnosis by detecting over 50 different types of the disease from a single sample. The trial, involving 25,000 adults, successfully identified cancers at an early stage in more than half of the positive cases, many of which have no existing screening programs. Developed by the firm Grail, the test works by identifying fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream and is currently undergoing a large-scale trial with the NHS in England. Researchers believe this technology could fundamentally change cancer screening, though experts await further data on its impact on mortality rates.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have confirmed that remains returned from Gaza are those of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old hostage who was killed during the October 7th attack. His body had been taken into Gaza from Nir Oz kibbutz, and his death was previously announced in December 2023. This marks the tenth deceased hostage to be repatriated, with the bodies of 18 others still in Gaza, leading to ongoing tensions over the terms of the recent ceasefire agreement. While Hamas states its commitment to returning all remains, it has cited difficulties caused by Israeli strikes as an impediment to locating them.</p>

The election is critical as the Turkish Cypriot leader's primary role is managing settlement negotiations for the divided island.

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Charlotte Morjaria, discovered she had a large, cancerous kidney tumor after a minor accident during a weekend trip to Butlin's.

A CT scan revealed not a broken rib but a 7cm tumor on her kidney, which had gone undetected despite symptoms like fatigue and weight loss. Following the chance discovery, she underwent surgery to remove her kidney and is now cancer-free, crediting the "drunken mishap" with saving her life.</p>

          <p>Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts, the second-largest producing state in the U.S., are facing increasing economic pressure from rising costs for labor, utilities, and real estate. Some growers are opting to participate in a state program that compensates them for retiring unprofitable bogs and converting them back into native wetlands. This "green exit strategy" allows farmers to invest the proceeds into more productive properties while permanently protecting the restored land. This trend reflects the challenges of farming in an expensive state and competing with larger-scale operations in places like Wisconsin, which has more than double the acreage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that prosecutors must begin a retrial for Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted in the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, by June 1, 2026. If jury selection for what would be his third trial does not start by that date, Hernandez will be released from prison. Hernandez was convicted in 2017, but a federal appeals court overturned the verdict, citing that the trial court gave the jury incorrect instructions regarding his confession. Hernandez's attorneys have long maintained that his confession was false and a result of mental illness.</p>

          <p>Clashes between Illinois state police and protesters outside the Broadview ICE detention center near Chicago resulted in at least 15 arrests on Friday. Tensions escalated when demonstrators moved out of designated protest zones, and officers in riot gear moved in to clear a roadway, tackling and dragging several individuals. The protest follows weeks of unrest at the facility and a recent court order requiring federal agents to wear body cameras during immigration operations. Protesters and local officials have criticized the tactics used by law enforcement, while police stated that some participants were blocking streets and disobeying orders.</p>

          <p>The popular Chinese television drama "Silent Honour" has inspired a wave of public appreciation for real-life intelligence agents from the country's past. Following the show's success, a park in Beijing has seen a sudden surge of visitors to the tomb of Wu Chen-shi, an underground Communist Party member who served as a high-ranking official in Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence in 1949. Visitors have been laying hundreds of flowers and leaving thank-you notes, paying tribute to Wu and other figures portrayed in the series as "unsung heroes" of China.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Approach to Ukraine Lacks Pressure Applied in Gaza Deal</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's differing approaches to foreign conflicts, contrasting his recent success in brokering a Gaza ceasefire with his handling of the war in Ukraine. While Trump exerted significant pressure on both Israel and Hamas to secure a deal, he has been reluctant to apply similar leverage on Russia. During a recent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump declined to authorize the transfer of Tomahawk missiles, a move Kyiv believes could force Moscow to negotiate. Instead, Trump has been swayed by Russian President Vladimir Putin's offers of trade deals and summits, effectively buying more time for Russia's war effort. (not investment advice)</p>
