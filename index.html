          <p>Historians cataloging early medieval Latin medical texts have discovered health and beauty practices that bear a striking resemblance to modern trends seen on platforms like TikTok. These ancient "hacks" include a 12-month herbal detox similar to juice cleanses, a vinegar and flour facial mask for radiant skin, and the use of barley water to aid digestion. However, the database also contains more bizarre and dangerous remedies, such as using dead vultures or goat dung for cures, highlighting the pre-scientific understanding of medicine. Modern medical experts advise against trying these historical treatments, noting the lack of scientific basis and potential for harm.</p>

          <p>The number of arrests at a London protest in support of the recently banned group Palestine Action has climbed to 532. The demonstration, held in Parliament Square, was the largest since the UK government proscribed the group under the Terrorism Act in July, making support for it a criminal offense. The Metropolitan Police reported that the vast majority of arrests were for displaying placards supporting the group, with a few others for offenses like assaulting officers. The Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now preparing to bring charges against those arrested for supporting the proscribed organization.</p>

          <p>A priest in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, has been hospitalized with a serious head injury after being attacked with a bottle inside St Patrick's Church. The incident occurred on Sunday morning just before Mass, when a man entered the church, assaulted Fr John Murray, and then fled the scene. Police have described the assault as "completely shocking and brutal" and confirmed the priest remains in serious condition. The attack has been widely condemned by local community leaders, who expressed their shock and disgust at the violent act taking place within a house of worship.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military operation in Gaza City, stating that Israel has no choice but to "complete the defeat of Hamas." In a press conference, he asserted that the goal is not to occupy Gaza but to "free" it, outlining a strategy that includes demilitarization and the installation of a non-Israeli civilian administration. The plan, approved by Israel's Security Cabinet, has drawn widespread condemnation over fears it will worsen the humanitarian crisis and endanger the remaining hostages. The announcement preceded an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the implications of the offensive.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at an outdoor neighborhood gathering in Baltimore on Saturday night resulted in the death of a 38-year-old man and left five others wounded, including a 5-year-old girl. According to police, the victims were at a crab feed when a suspect opened fire. The young girl sustained a non-life-threatening hand injury, while the other adult victims are also expected to survive their injuries. Police Commissioner Richard Worley stated that the motive is still under investigation and that authorities currently have little information about the suspect, urging the public to provide any relevant details.</p>

          <h2>Cryptocurrency Gains Political and Financial Influence in Washington and on Wall Street</h2>

          <p>Cryptocurrency, once a fringe asset, is now gaining significant traction in Washington and on Wall Street, bolstered by a more favorable political climate under the Trump administration. The industry has invested heavily in lobbying and supporting crypto-friendly candidates, leading to legislation like the Genius Act, which facilitates corporate digital currencies. While proponents see a new economic frontier, former regulators like Amanda Fischer warn of the high volatility and speculative nature of crypto, drawing parallels to the subprime mortgages that led to the 2008 financial crisis. The article highlights the debate over regulation and the potential risks for consumers as digital assets become more mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is leading a legal fight against YouTube after his likeness was used in a sophisticated bitcoin giveaway scam that defrauded users of their savings. Wozniak's lawsuit has been stalled for five years due to Section 230, a federal law that provides broad liability protection for internet platforms regarding third-party content. He argues that tech giants like YouTube are not doing enough to stop obvious fraud on their platforms, turning a blind eye to criminal activity. The article explores the broader issue of internet scams, the challenges victims face, and the debate over whether Section 230 should be reformed to hold platforms more accountable.</p>

Updegrove's book, "Incomparable Grace: JFK in the Presidency," provides a detailed account of the political landscape in the weeks before President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963. At the time, Kennedy's team was optimistic about his 1964 reelection prospects, citing a strong economy, high approval ratings, and a field of potentially weak Republican challengers. The excerpt recounts the strategic planning for the fundraising trip to Texas, which was intended to shore up support and mend party divisions.

Kennedy's assassination, a definitive "smoking gun" to upend the official narrative remains elusive. Journalist Jefferson Morley, who has pursued the files for 30 years, argues the documents show the CIA extensively monitored Lee Harvey Oswald for years before the assassination, information it withheld from the Warren Commission. While the files don't prove a wider conspiracy, they raise questions about why the agency concealed its knowledge of Oswald. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta acknowledges the agency's secrecy but states he has seen no evidence to change the conclusion that Oswald acted alone.</p>

A personal brand, defined as what you are known for professionally, allows individuals to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents. Chan suggests that introverts can overcome their fear of self-promotion by starting with small, consistent actions, such as sending one networking email a month or posting weekly on a professional platform. She emphasizes that branding is not just an online activity but is also built through offline engagement in communities and hobby groups.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark," prompts a re-examination of the novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic wit obscures her identity as a major modern religious writer. A Catholic convert, Spark's work was deeply influenced by the Book of Job, and she often structured her narratives to mimic the relationship between an omniscient, capricious God and humanity. The article explores how her experiences, from working in British psyops during WWII to a nervous breakdown, shaped her obsession with truth, fiction, and control. Her signature use of "auto-spoilers," revealing a character's fate early on, forced readers to focus on theology and free will rather than simple plot.</p>

          <h2>New Novel Explores Literature's Enduring Fascination with 'Strange Sisters'</h2>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," engages with the long-standing literary trope of strange and mystical sisters who are perceived as a menace to their community. The novel, set in the 18th century, tells the story of five sisters accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, exploring why femininity, especially in a collective form, is often seen as unnatural and threatening. The article analyzes how this trope has functioned historically in works from "Macbeth" to fairy tales, where sisters serve as a test for other characters. While "The Hounding" risks predictable conclusions about misogyny, it powerfully illustrates how ancient fears of female power remain relevant.</p>

          <p>London is experiencing another day of demonstrations related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, with a march planned to demand the release of hostages held by Hamas. This follows a day where police arrested 474 people for supporting Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned by the government as a terrorist organization. The arrests for supporting the group were the highest in a single day in a decade. The dueling protests highlight the deep and continuing tensions in the UK over the conflict, with groups mobilizing to advocate for both the hostages and for Palestinian causes.</p>

          <p>A coalition of key European nations, including the EU, UK, France, and Germany, has issued a joint statement emphasizing that peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. The statement came ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which currently excludes Ukraine's leader. While welcoming Trump's efforts to end the conflict, the European leaders stressed their commitment to a "just and lasting peace" and the principle that international borders cannot be changed by force. The White House has indicated it is open to including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, but the meeting remains bilateral at Putin's request.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little made a 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a distance that would have shattered the current NFL record. However, because the kick occurred in a preseason match, it will not be officially recorded in the NFL's record books. The current record is a 66-yard field goal made by Baltimore's Justin Tucker in 2021. Despite it not counting officially, the successful kick caused a massive celebration among Little's teammates and demonstrates his powerful leg, suggesting he could be a significant weapon for the team.</p>

          <p>According to an expert who helps Americans move abroad, Albania is emerging as a top overlooked destination in Europe due to its affordability, natural beauty, and welcoming visa policies. Americans can stay in Albania for up to a year without a visa, a rare advantage that allows for a "test drive" of expat life. The country offers a significantly lower cost of living, with apartments available for under $500 a month, and boasts a growing, friendly expat community. While historically isolated, Albania's stunning Adriatic coastline and rugged mountains are now attracting digital nomads, families, and retirees seeking a high quality of life.</p>

Among the highlighted companies are energy giant Chevron (CVX), asset manager Rithm Capital (RITM), and telecom leader AT&T (T). Analysts have issued buy ratings for these stocks, citing factors such as Chevron's strengthened business following its Hess acquisition, Rithm's pivot to an alternative investment manager model, and AT&T's strong subscriber growth and strategic capital investments.

Palantir's government contract revenue surged, while private prison firms noted their detention facilities are fuller than ever, with executives signaling opportunities for "unprecedented growth."

While politically popular, some tax experts argue that these holidays primarily benefit wealthier consumers who can time their large purchases and that they simply shift consumer spending rather than boosting it.

The article argues that this focus can create a distorted view of the world, breeding cynicism and inaction. Cultivating a sense of "realistic optimism" by acknowledging genuine progress is presented as a necessary tool for building resilience and fostering the belief that major problems are solvable.</p>
