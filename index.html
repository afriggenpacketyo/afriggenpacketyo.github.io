          <p>A person aboard a boat opened fire on the American Fish Company, an outdoor bar in Southport, North Carolina, tragically killing three people and injuring eight others. The incident, which occurred at the Southport Yacht Basin as the vessel proceeded up the Intracoastal Waterway, prompted city officials to issue an urgent active shooter warning, advising residents to avoid the waterfront and stay indoors. This small coastal community, situated near the mouth of the Cape Fear River, is now grappling with the shock and grief from the unexpected violence that has shaken its peaceful environment. Law enforcement is actively questioning a person of interest, working diligently to establish the motive and full circumstances of this developing story and ensure justice.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, has dedicated a new seven-foot bronze statue, 'Requiem,' commemorating the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre where 28 Chinese people were killed and 14 injured. This initiative, supported by local students and history museums, marks a significant shift from a previously inconspicuous plaque, aiming to acknowledge a violent chapter of its anti-immigrant past. The monument's unveiling comes as researchers unearth artifacts from the burned Chinatown, providing a deeper understanding of the labor tensions that led to the deadliest incident of anti-Chinese violence in U.S. history. Mayor Max Mickelson, despite his county's anti-immigrant voting record, advocates for honoring the town's diverse migrant history.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Hairy Crab Prices Decline Ahead of Golden Week Amid Weak Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 00:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hairy crab prices in China have seen a notable decline, dropping by approximately 20 yuan per kilogram compared to the previous year, with further reductions expected as the "super golden week" holiday approaches. Industry insiders attribute this downturn to a combination of higher production volumes, shrinking demand for traditional gift-giving, and a general weakness in household spending. This extended eight-day holiday, which merges the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival, is being closely watched as a critical indicator for the health of domestic consumer demand across various sectors, from retail to travel. Additionally, warmer climate conditions have led to earlier maturation of the crabs this year, with their peak flavor now anticipated towards the end of this month.</p>

He highlighted the conference as a platform for Labour to offer an alternative to what he termed "toxic divide and decline." Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also commented on immigration, emphasizing the need for migrants to contribute to their wider community for long-term settlement.</p>

          <p>Moldova is holding crucial parliamentary elections, with its path towards European Union membership hanging in the balance amidst allegations of significant Russian interference. Two pro-Russia parties, Greater Moldova and Heart of Moldova, were disqualified due to illegal and foreign funding, a decision being appealed. President Maia Sandu warned that Moscow is spending "hundreds of millions of euros" to influence the vote and destabilize the country, emphasizing that Moldova's territorial integrity and independence are at stake. Polls suggest Sandu's pro-EU party may lose its majority, making the outcome pivotal for the former Soviet republic's future alignment between Brussels and Moscow.</p>

Portland Police Chief Bob Day reported no uptick in violent unrest, contrary to the President's claims.

          <p>This opinion article posits that the return of US President Donald Trump could lead to a "reverse convergence" in US-China relations, moving away from traditional ideological frameworks. The author suggests that the US may adopt an approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace more akin to China's, rather than China converging with liberal democratic values. This perspective challenges the long-held Western "convergence theory," which oversimplifies global social change and power dynamics. The article argues that this potential shift marks an early stage of a future trend, altering the dynamics between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have urged Iran to de-escalate tensions and engage in negotiations after reinstating sweeping UN sanctions over its "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation. The sanctions, reimposed a decade after being lifted, were triggered as a "last resort" due to Iran's breaches of the 2015 nuclear deal and refusal to cooperate with the IAEA. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the sanctions as "unfair, unjust, and illegal" and recalled ambassadors from the E3 nations for consultations. Despite the diplomatic impasse, the E3 affirmed their commitment to pursuing diplomatic routes.</p>

          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first commercial rice crop in Cambridgeshire, an experiment previously dismissed as a joke, now ripe for picking after the country's hottest summer on record. Led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, this trial explores future food sources and climate change mitigation. Growing rice on re-wetted peat soils could lock in greenhouse gases, offering a model for sustainable agriculture. While commercial viability is still distant, the project suggests UK-grown rice could become a reality within a decade, addressing both food security and environmental concerns.</p>

The move heightens fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the United States, as Iran continues uranium enrichment and faces increased internal repression.

          <p>Tensions between Venezuela and the US have escalated following deadly US naval strikes on suspected drug boats in the South Caribbean, prompting President Nicolás Maduro to train a civilian militia for a potential "undeclared war." Maduro has ordered the military to instruct volunteers, mainly older citizens, in handling arms, claiming over 8.2 million civilians are enlisted. While experts doubt the naval deployment signals an invasion, the relationship has deteriorated since Donald Trump's return to office. This article highlights the combative rhetoric and increased militarization within Venezuela, juxtaposed with the daily routines of unperturbed residents.</p>

          <p>Europe has established an unprecedented 11½-4½ lead over the USA heading into the Ryder Cup singles, marking their largest ever pre-singles advantage. This commanding performance occurred amidst a backdrop of "thuggish, moronic and personal insults" from American galleries directed particularly at Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, which overshadowed the event. Despite the unsportsmanlike conduct, European captain Luke Donald remained pragmatic, emphasizing the job isn't done yet. The article details Europe's dominance and the unfortunate crowd behavior, which led to enhanced security and declining resale ticket prices for the final day.</p>

          <p>Stephany Gauffeny, pregnant wife of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, is speaking out after her husband was critically injured and left on life support in a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility. Garcia-Hernandez, an undocumented immigrant detained for DUI, was shackled in the hospital, and access to his room is controlled by ICE, complicating family visits. The shooting, which killed one detainee and injured another, was perpetrated by a man seeking to "terrorize" ICE agents, though all victims were detainees. Gauffeny seeks to humanize her husband, emphasizing he was a "great dad" and not just a "criminal."</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's forthcoming book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers a rare glimpse into his 30 years as the court's swing justice, particularly his decisive votes on same-sex marriage and abortion. Kennedy, who states "The cases swung, not me," expresses deep concern over America's current political discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, fearing for democracy's survival. He recounts the personal impact of his gay marriage decision on his relationship with Justice Scalia and his own moral conflicts regarding abortion, ultimately upholding a woman's choice based on constitutional liberty. This article delves into his evolving judicial philosophy.</p>

          <h2>The Efficacy of Collagen Supplements in Reducing Signs of Skin Ageing Explored</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 18:37:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, examining various forms like marine, bovine, and vegan collagen. While some users report positive effects on skin, hair, and nails, consultant dermatologists remain skeptical about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin cells directly. Industry-funded studies often suggest significant improvements, contrasting with independent research showing no effect. Experts recommend marine collagen for its Type 1 content, but ultimately advise that sunblock, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking have a far greater impact on skin health than expensive supplements.</p>
