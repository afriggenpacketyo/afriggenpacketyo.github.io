          <p>President Donald Trump announced a significant breakthrough, stating that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace deal following negotiations in Egypt. This agreement is expected to lead to the swift release of all hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed line, marking a crucial step towards lasting peace. The Israel Defense Forces are preparing for the hostage return operation, while Hamas has already submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners for exchange. This development brings a glimmer of hope for de-escalation in the war-torn Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla, previously a hurricane, is currently weakening off Mexico's Pacific coast, though it continues to bring high surf and gusty winds to Baja California Sur. Forecasters warn that the storm still carries a risk of significant rainfall, potentially up to four inches, and scattered flash flooding for portions of the southwestern U.S., including Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Priscilla is projected to weaken further over the next 48 hours, becoming a remnant low by Friday, yet life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are expected to continue along affected coasts.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry is strengthening in the central Atlantic Ocean, far from land, and is projected to become a hurricane later this week or over the weekend. The tenth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Jerry currently has maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and is moving west-northwest. A tropical storm watch is active for several northern Leeward Islands, which could experience two to four inches of rain and flash flooding. Swells generated by Jerry are also expected to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions in the Leeward and Windward Islands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has formalized and tightened its export regulations on rare earth elements and related processing technologies, crucial for high-tech products like electric vehicles and jet engines. The new rules, announced by the Ministry of Commerce, restrict the export of mining, smelting, separation, and magnetic material manufacturing technologies without government permission. This move is expected to impact foreign arms manufacturers and some semiconductor firms, intensifying trade tensions with the U.S., which relies on China for much of its rare earth processing despite having its own mining industry.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleged that a boat struck by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea last week, which killed four individuals, carried Colombian citizens. The White House swiftly denounced this claim as "baseless and reprehensible," urging Petro to retract his statement to maintain productive dialogue between the two nations. This allegation adds to the scrutiny of the Trump administration's campaign of strikes against alleged drug-carrying vessels, which critics argue lack legal approval and risk escalating into broader conflict, despite U.S. claims of combating drug trafficking.</p>

Rojas, the first charged under the Texas Human Life Protection Act, faces 15 felony counts.

          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war, now in its first phase, outlines an immediate ceasefire, phased Israeli troop withdrawal, and a hostage-for-prisoner exchange. The plan calls for Gaza's demilitarization under international monitors, with governance shifting to a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" and an "International Stabilization Force." It also addresses humanitarian aid, economic redevelopment, and hints at a pathway to Palestinian statehood, though Netanyahu has opposed this. Hamas agreed to key portions, but significant questions remain regarding implementation and the roles of various international partners.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan has restricted access to major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat on multiple mobile providers, according to global internet monitor NetBlocks. This follows a previous ban on TikTok in 2022 and a complete internet suspension in late September. Users in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif reported needing VPNs to access the platforms, while others experienced slow or intermittent service. The Taliban has not officially confirmed the restrictions, which rights groups criticize for having serious implications, particularly for women and girls, by further isolating the country from the outside world.</p>

          <p>Anxiety is rising in Portland, Oregon, as businesses struggle with President Trump's rhetoric, which describes the city as "war-ravaged" and "burning to the ground," amid his efforts to deploy the National Guard. Local business owners report significant declines in revenue since 2020, exacerbated by the president's negative portrayal, despite protests being largely contained to a single block. A federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops under federal control, but an appeals court later granted a White House request to maintain federal control, though deployment to Portland remains prohibited for now.</p>

The Christmas Trade Group is in discussions with the Trump administration to address these challenges, which come amidst concerns of weaker consumer demand.
