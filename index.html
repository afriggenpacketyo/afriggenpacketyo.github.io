          <p>Russia's government is preparing to increase taxes on businesses and consumers to sustain military spending as the war in Ukraine continues. The 2026 draft budget reveals plans to raise VAT and other taxes, a move analysts say shifts the financial burden of the conflict directly onto the Russian public. This strategy comes as the nation's economic growth is projected to slow significantly, forcing the Kremlin to adopt austerity measures that could further strain the civilian economy. The budget also indicates a shift in focus towards national security and law enforcement alongside traditional defense spending. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid the ongoing government shutdown, former President Donald Trump has signaled his intention to permanently reduce the federal workforce, referring to the situation as an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut "dead wood." The Office of Management and Budget Director, Russell Vought, has reportedly warned lawmakers that firings of furloughed federal employees are imminent as part of a reduction in force initiative. This approach marks a significant escalation in the political standoff, using the shutdown as a means to pursue long-term policy goals of shrinking the government. The move has drawn sharp criticism and raises legal questions about the administration's authority to permanently fire workers during a temporary lapse in funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a record influx of foreign tourists, the practice of tipping remains a cultural taboo in Japan, often causing confusion and awkwardness for service industry workers. Good service is considered a standard part of the job, not something that requires an additional reward, and many Japanese workers will return tips left by visitors. While a few establishments in tourist-heavy areas have introduced tip jars, the concept is largely resisted by locals who view it as unnecessary and potentially disrespectful. The cultural difference highlights a point of friction as Japan navigates its growing popularity as an international travel destination.</p>

          <p>A violent attack occurred outside a synagogue in Manchester, England, during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, resulting in the deaths of two individuals and serious injuries to three others. The suspect reportedly used a vehicle to ram into people before carrying out stabbings and was subsequently shot and killed by police at the scene. The incident has been widely condemned by U.K. officials, including the Prime Minister and the Mayor of Greater Manchester, who described it as a "vile attack" on the Jewish community.

          <p>A low-speed collision involving two Delta Connection aircraft occurred on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport, causing minor damage and one minor injury. The incident happened when the wing of a departing plane struck the fuselage of an arriving plane that was taxiing to its gate. Passengers were deplaned and transported by shuttle buses, with the airline providing accommodations and rebooking flights. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the collision, which occurred after air traffic control had instructed one of the planes to hold its position. The event did not cause significant disruptions to overall airport operations.</p>

Speaking on the second day of the shutdown, Bessent stated that the impasse could result in a hit to the GDP and harm working Americans, criticizing the method of shutting down the government to resolve political disputes. The U.S. economy has seen positive growth in recent quarters, but a prolonged stoppage and potential permanent firing of federal workers could reverse this trend. The warning comes as the labor market shows signs of slowing, with private payrolls declining in September. (not investment advice)</p>

The region's history as a contested border territory between France and Germany has shaped its distinct identity and fostered a strong sense of European unity.

The case is described as flimsy, noting that the previous U.S. attorney for the district had refused to press charges before being replaced by a Trump loyalist.

          <h2>Man Falsely Accused of Decapitating Sea Lion After Misunderstanding on California Beach</h2>

          <p>A California man was wrongly identified by a federal agency as a suspect in the decapitation of a sea lion, an accusation he says stemmed from a sarcastic remark made to another beachgoer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initially offered a $20,000 reward for information about the man, Jason Bietz, before retracting the post and clarifying that no animal parts were taken. Bietz claims he and his daughter were merely observing a deceased sea lion when confronted, and his comment about taking the head was not serious. The woman who reported him now believes she may have stopped him before he could act, but acknowledges he did not actually remove the head.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs report indicates that a rising percentage of working Americans are unable to save money after covering basic living expenses, making retirement savings an increasingly difficult goal. The study found that 42% of younger workers have no spare savings, a figure that has grown from 31% in 1997 and is projected to exceed 50% by 2033. This financial strain is attributed to the escalating costs of essentials like housing and healthcare, which consume a larger portion of income than in previous decades. The report suggests that simply advising workers to 'save more' is insufficient to address the systemic financial pressures they face. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman who survived the deadly shooting at a Michigan church says she locked eyes with the gunman moments after he had killed her father and three others, and that he chose to let her live. In a handwritten statement, Lisa Louis described seeing pain and a sense of being lost in the shooter's eyes, and she instantly forgave him in her heart. The gunman, Thomas Sanford, rammed his truck into the church before opening fire and was later killed by police. Friends indicated Sanford held a grudge against the Mormon church. Louis's brother-in-law believes her interaction with the gunman provided precious time for others to escape the building.</p>

This rapid change, fueled by the great wealth transfer through trusts and family offices, will have major implications for industries catering to the rich.

          <p>Microsoft has announced a substantial price increase for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, prompting anger from many gamers. The most popular tier, Ultimate, will see its monthly price rise by over 50% from £14.99 to £22.99, leading numerous users to report they are canceling their subscriptions. Microsoft justified the change by stating it would offer more flexibility and value, and it has added several blockbuster games to the service's library. However, critics argue the move is anti-consumer and risks pricing people out of the hobby, questioning the long-term sustainability of the "best deal in gaming" model as development costs rise.</p>

While parents see it as a low-pressure introduction to phone use, children are drawn to the tactile, "old-timey" appeal of the devices.

The article argues that in a political climate hostile to Latino culture, platforming an artist like Bad Bunny on America's biggest stage is a remarkable act of corporate resistance.

Despite firefighters being dispatched to numerous electrical incidents, the utility, Southern California Edison, did not shut off power to most of the area's circuits.
