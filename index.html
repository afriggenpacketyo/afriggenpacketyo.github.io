          <p>A Baltimore couple, who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on the tenth anniversary of its nationwide legalization. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak recount their personal struggles, such as being denied access during childbirth, which fueled their fight for equality. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, it raised awareness that contributed to Maryland legalizing same-sex marriage in 2012. They express concern over current efforts to roll back these rights, emphasizing the importance of protecting the safety and equality of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>A group of engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has successfully invented a specialized printer capable of adding braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine to handle materials that commercial braille printers could not. Designed with open hardware, the printer allows employees with low or no vision to operate it easily by touch. The students have already used their invention to produce 400 labels for a fundraiser, streamlining a previously manual and laborious process for BISM workers.</p>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio has condemned recent calls within Iran for the arrest and execution of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi as unacceptable. This follows Iran's decision to ban Grossi and remove surveillance equipment from its nuclear facilities, citing security concerns. The threats emerged after the IAEA commented on the significant damage to Iranian nuclear sites like Fordow and Natanz following recent U.S. airstrikes. Rubio reaffirmed U.S. support for the IAEA's monitoring efforts and called on Iran to ensure the safety of all agency personnel operating within the country.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of a major spending and tax bill is nearing a floor vote amidst internal Republican division over its contents and cost. The extensive package proposes to make several 2017 tax cuts permanent, including lower income-tax brackets and a higher child tax credit, while also introducing new temporary tax breaks. However, it also contains contentious elements like deep cuts to Medicaid, an increased cap for the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit. The bill's passage remains uncertain due to concerns from fiscal conservatives over its proposed $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved new record highs this week, demonstrating resilience in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions following U.S. military action in Iran. Markets initially reacted with concern but quickly shrugged off the conflict, betting it would not systemically impact the U.S. economy or corporate earnings. A key factor was the rapid decline in oil prices after an initial surge, which eased fears of inflation and constrained consumer spending. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by increasing expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year, despite a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation report.

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a series of significant rulings that favored conservative states and bolstered President Trump's claims of executive authority. The court's 6-3 conservative majority handed down decisions granting states more power to regulate medical treatments for transgender teens and to enforce age-verification laws for adult websites. In a procedural victory for the administration, the justices also reined in the power of district judges to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policies. While the court has repeatedly sided with the administration on fast-tracked appeals, it has yet to issue a clear ruling on the constitutional limits of the president's power.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from the ancient city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that female offspring likely remained in their family homes while males moved to their wives' households upon marriage. The findings are supported by the preferential treatment of females in burials, who received five times more grave goods than males, challenging Western biases about historical social structures.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 81 Palestinians and injured over 400 more in a 24-hour period. One of the deadliest incidents occurred near a stadium in Gaza City, where a strike on an area housing displaced people in tents killed at least 11 individuals, including children. Meanwhile, mediators are reportedly intensifying efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, though negotiations remain stalled. A rally in Tel Aviv called for an agreement to free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger stranded on the side of a highway in a remote area of San Luis Obispo County. A concerned driver had called in the sighting along Highway 166. However, when an officer arrived to investigate the scene, they found no evidence of a tiger cub. Instead, the officer discovered a deceased hawk on the roadside. It remains unclear why the caller mistook the bird for a large feline, and the California Department of Transportation was notified to remove the animal.</p>

          <p>One week after U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, descriptions of the attack's effectiveness from the Trump administration have been inconsistent. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," a leaked preliminary intelligence report suggested the setback was only a matter of months. Officials later shifted their emphasis, highlighting that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, rather than focusing solely on the physical destruction. Questions remain about the extent of the damage to underground facilities and the current location of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters, led by university students, rallied in Belgrade on Saturday to demand early parliamentary elections from President Aleksandar Vucic's government. The demonstrators have issued an ultimatum, threatening a campaign of civil disobedience if their demands are not met. These protests are the latest in a series of actions that began after a deadly rail station collapse last year, which was widely attributed to government corruption and negligence. President Vucic has rejected the calls for a snap election, accusing unspecified "foreign powers" of orchestrating the unrest, while his supporters held a counter-rally nearby.</p>

The protests, largely driven by Generation Z, initially targeted a tax law but have since broadened to address economic hardship and dissatisfaction with President William Ruto's government.

At a recent evangelical summit, GOP leaders characterized the 33-year-old Democratic socialist as a "communist," using his victory to energize their base ahead of elections. In response, some Democrats have defended Mamdani against what they call Islamophobic and racist attacks, while others, particularly moderates, have distanced themselves from his platform.

          <p>The Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades has reopened to the public for the first time since being closed for nearly six months due to the devastating Palisades fire in January. While the museum itself was undamaged, the surrounding grounds required extensive repairs. To mark its reopening, the Villa debuted a new exhibit titled "The Kingdom of Pylos," which showcases over 230 works of ancient Messenian art and artifacts, many of which are on display in the United States for the first time. The museum is currently operating on a limited schedule from Friday through Monday.</p>

          <h2>J.M. Smucker Company Pledges to Remove Artificial Colors from Products by 2027</h2>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its food products by the end of 2027. This commitment extends to products sold to K-12 schools, which will be free of synthetic dyes by the 2026-2027 school year. While many of its popular items like Uncrustables are already free from these additives, some products, including certain jams, ice cream toppings, and Hostess snacks like Twinkies, still contain them. Smucker joins a growing list of major food corporations, including Nestle and Kraft Heinz, that have recently pledged to phase out synthetic dyes amid increased federal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is facing a crisis after the Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party, withdrew from President Cyril Ramaphosa's "National Dialogue" initiative. The move came after Ramaphosa dismissed a DA deputy minister, prompting DA leader John Steenhuisen to accuse the president of double standards for not acting against alleged corruption within his own African National Congress (ANC) party. The DA has also threatened to withhold support for budgets led by ministers accused of corruption. This public clash between the two main coalition partners threatens the stability of the government formed just over a year ago.</p>

          <h2>British and Irish Lions Begin Australian Tour with Convincing Victory Amid Injury Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 12:38:13 EDT</div>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions started their tour of Australia with a decisive 50-point victory over the Western Force in Perth, scoring eight tries in a display of ambitious, attacking rugby. Despite the dominant performance, the team faces an early injury concern with Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who scored twice before leaving the field with a tight hamstring. Head coach Andy Farrell noted that while the team's high penalty count in the first half showed a lack of composure, the overall attacking intent and creativity were promising signs. The tour now proceeds to Brisbane for a match against the Queensland Reds.</p>
