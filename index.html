          <p>Public viewings for the late Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga have resulted in multiple casualties. Dozens were injured at a stadium in Kisumu as large crowds surged forward, following earlier incidents where at least seven people died in stampedes and altercations with security forces at other memorial events in Nairobi. The 80-year-old former prime minister was a major figure in Kenyan politics for decades, and the massive turnouts reflect his significant following. Due to the ongoing safety risks, a planned road procession was canceled, with his body being flown directly to his homestead for burial.</p>

          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport when a United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while taxiing to its gate. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who deplaned normally after a delay. The incident involved the plane's wing striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other aircraft. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway incidents and near misses across the United States, although many passengers on this flight were initially unaware a collision had even happened.</p>

          <p>Efforts are underway to restore the main external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, announced that a "complex repair plan" is proceeding after Russian and Ukrainian forces established special ceasefire zones to ensure the safety of the repair crews. The plant, which is Europe's largest and currently under Russian control, needs a reliable power source to cool its six shutdown reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident. Ukrainian officials noted this is the 42nd time power lines to the plant have required restoration since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>Job seekers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to create professional headshots for platforms like LinkedIn, seeking an affordable alternative to costly photography sessions. AI tools from companies like Canva and HeadshotPro allow users to generate polished profile pictures for under $50 by uploading selfies, which some users claim has led to a significant increase in recruiter engagement. However, the trend raises concerns about authenticity among HR professionals, who value genuine representation and can be put off by overly stylized or fake-looking images. Despite the risks, the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of AI headshots are making them a popular choice in the current competitive labor market.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have identified the remains of Eliyahu Margalit, 76, as the eighth deceased hostage returned by Hamas as part of the ongoing peace agreement. Margalit was abducted from a kibbutz during the October 7th attack. The transfer comes amid accusations that Hamas has delayed the return of the remains of 28 dead captives, a key component of the peace plan. U.S. officials have urged patience, citing the immense difficulty of locating and recovering bodies from the rubble in Gaza, and have confirmed that American personnel will assist in the recovery efforts for the at least 20 hostages still unaccounted for.</p>

          <p>Zions Bancorporation's stock value dropped by $1 billion after it disclosed $60 million in loans that are unlikely to be repaid, sparking broader fears about the regional banking sector. The bank's subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, has filed a lawsuit alleging that managers of several "Cantor Group" funds engaged in a "sweeping betrayal of trust" by secretly subordinating the bank's loans and eliminating the collateral. The lawsuit claims the fund managers enriched themselves by making their own entities the new senior lenders, effectively transferring the bank's losses into their gains. This discovery was prompted by a separate fraud lawsuit filed against the same group by Western Alliance. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision was made in consultation with King Charles III, as accusations from Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who alleged she was sexually trafficked to the prince, were deemed a distraction to the Royal Family's work. Although he settled a lawsuit with Giuffre in 2022 and continues to deny the allegations, the prince is stepping further back from public life, a process that began after a widely criticized 2019 BBC interview.

In a social media post, Trump urged the two nations to "stop the killing, and make a DEAL," proposing that current property lines defined by the conflict should stand. The meeting occurred just a day after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and announced an upcoming summit. During their discussion, Zelenskyy indicated that the potential U.S. provision of long-range Tomahawk missiles was not discussed publicly to avoid escalation, though Trump had earlier expressed openness to a trade.</p>

These groups serve as a crucial gateway to therapy, as Black men are less likely to seek professional mental health support and often face culturally incompetent care when they do.

Her decision comes in the wake of a Texas state law that restricts state-funded universities from partnering with Chinese institutions, reflecting broader U.S. concerns about national security.

Greene recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships with narrower criteria to reduce the applicant pool.

          <p>A grassroots campaign in Missouri, led by the group People Not Politicians Missouri, is working to overturn the state's newly enacted gerrymandered congressional map through a voter referendum. Volunteers are collecting signatures to place the issue on the 2026 ballot, which would allow citizens to reject the map drawn by the Republican-led legislature. The new map, signed into law by Governor Mike Kehoe, is part of a national Republican strategy to maintain control of the U.S. House and targets the district of longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II in Kansas City. The effort faces legal challenges from the state's top election officials but has already gathered significant public support.</p>

          <p>A Cameroon-flagged tanker caught fire in the Gulf of Aden after being hit by an unknown projectile, according to the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center. The incident occurred approximately 130 miles east of Aden, Yemen, a region where Houthi rebels have frequently targeted shipping vessels. While no group immediately claimed responsibility, maritime security firm Ambrey reported that radio traffic indicated the crew was preparing to abandon the ship and a search-and-rescue operation was underway. The targeted vessel has been previously identified as part of an alleged Iranian "ghost fleet" used to transport oil products despite international sanctions.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health and adult success. She advises starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, teaching kids about online privacy, the permanence of digital content, and the value of their time. Twenge also stresses the importance of setting firm rules once devices are introduced, such as using basic phones without internet first, implementing parental controls for time limits, and banning phones from bedrooms overnight. This proactive approach aims to help children develop a healthier, more moderate relationship with technology.</p>

          <p>Michael Berkowitz, a former commodities trader, launched the luxury coat brand Norwegian Wool from his Bronx apartment in 2014 with a $50,000 personal investment. He identified a market gap for stylish, professional coats that could withstand cold winters, a feature often lacking in high-fashion Italian outerwear. By combining Italian tailoring with warm linings, his brand attracted a clientele of financiers, politicians, and billionaires, and was even featured in the HBO show "Succession." After successfully selling his initial run of 200 coats, Berkowitz left his finance job and has since grown Norwegian Wool into a profitable company sold in over 100 stores worldwide.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has directed airlines to ignore the "X" gender marker on passports and instead input either "M" for male or "F" for female for international travel documentation. This new rule has created confusion and concern among non-binary and transgender travelers who use the "X" marker, which was introduced in 2022 for U.S. passport holders. While courts have affirmed that passports with an "X" marker remain valid travel documents, advocates worry the policy could lead to increased scrutiny, invasive pat-downs, and discretionary discrimination by individual agents at the border. The practical implementation and enforcement of the rule remain unclear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes investments into three types: currency-denominated assets, non-productive assets like gold, and productive assets such as farms or businesses. He argues that currency-based investments are a bet on government stability and typically decline in value over time. Buffett describes gold as an asset that produces nothing, with its value relying solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future due to fear. He strongly favors the third category—productive assets that deliver tangible returns, like crops from a farm or profits from a company—as the basis for rational, long-term wealth creation.

          <p>A significant political trend is emerging in the United States, with Gen Z women identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in modern history, creating a notable gender divide with their male peers. Many of these young women reject the "liberal" label, feeling that the Democratic party has become too centrist and beholden to corporate interests. Their political views are shaped by coming of age amidst economic instability, climate change, and threats to reproductive rights, leading them to see radical change as a necessity for self-defense rather than a choice. This leftist identification reflects a deep disillusionment with the existing political duopoly and a desire for systemic solutions to pressing social and economic issues.</p>

Santos had been serving a more than seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to charges of wire fraud and identity theft. In a social media post, Trump stated that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison, including being held in solitary confinement. The commutation, which is not a pardon and does not clear his criminal record, has drawn criticism from fellow Republicans who believe Santos' crimes warranted a longer sentence. Santos was expelled from Congress in 2023 following an ethics report on his conduct.</p>
