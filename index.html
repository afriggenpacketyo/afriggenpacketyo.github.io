            <p>Following a deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River that killed five tourists from Spain and the pilot, New York Helicopter Tours is shutting down its operations. The FAA is launching a review of the company's license and safety record while assisting the NTSB's investigation. Senator Chuck Schumer had called for the company to pause flights, citing safety concerns and a history of accidents in the industry. The crash has renewed concerns about the safety of sightseeing helicopter tours in New York City, with calls for stricter regulations and potential bans on non-essential flights.</p>

            <p>A plane carrying six people crashed in an open field near Copake, N.Y., resulting in the deaths of all onboard. The victims were identified as members of the Groff family and their partners, who were traveling for a holiday celebration. According to the NTSB, the aircraft was intact before it crashed at a high rate of descent, and air traffic control was unable to make contact with the pilot despite repeated attempts. The NTSB is leading the investigation to determine the cause of the crash, with initial findings suggesting a rapid descent without any prior communication of distress.</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice has responded to a motion for relief by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador, stating that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch in foreign relations matters. The DOJ argues that the requests by Abrego Garcia's attorneys, which include demanding action from the El Salvadoran government and sending personnel and aircraft to extract him, would violate the sovereignty of a foreign nation.

            <p>The UK government is racing to secure raw materials for British Steel's Scunthorpe plant after taking control to prevent its closure. Officials are working to obtain coking coal and iron ore to keep the blast furnaces burning. The government intervened after negotiations with the Chinese owner, Jingye, broke down, citing concerns about the plant's financial sustainability. The Scunthorpe plant is the last site in the UK capable of producing virgin steel, making its preservation a priority for the government.</p>

            <p>A new CBS News poll reveals mixed opinions on President Trump's tariff and trade policies, with concerns about rising prices and the financial impact. While Republicans are more likely to support the tariffs and believe they will create jobs, most Americans anticipate higher prices. The poll also shows a growing number of people feel Trump's policies are making them financially worse off. Despite these concerns, a majority of Americans view the current economic situation as being shaped more by Trump's policies than those of his predecessor.</p>

            <p>Amid market volatility and concerns about treasury bond yields, a bond ladder strategy is presented as a way to generate income and reduce risk.
