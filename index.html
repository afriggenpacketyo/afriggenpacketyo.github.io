          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde voiced her hope that President Trump would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, acknowledging the political pressures both she and Powell face. Lagarde refrained from commenting on potential market implications, emphasizing her respect for Powell's dedication to his mandate and disciplined approach. Trump has been pressuring Powell to lower interest rates, while Powell has suggested Trump's trade policies could hinder economic growth and drive inflation. Lagarde affirmed that both she and Powell prioritize fulfilling their mandates amidst political pressures.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party is experiencing an identity crisis, with younger, progressive members challenging established leaders. Figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and David Hogg are advocating for new leadership and strategies, criticizing past missteps and pushing for a rebrand of the party. This generational clash reflects differing views on how to challenge President Trump and connect with voters, particularly younger demographics who have shifted towards the Republican Party. Some analysts believe Ocasio-Cortez could be a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential nomination.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students by Tuesday evening. The order grants temporary restraining orders on behalf of the plaintiffs, who claimed their student statuses were unlawfully revoked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that ICE abruptly terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), potentially leading to deportation.</p>
