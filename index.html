          <p>The abbot of the renowned Shaolin Temple, Shi Yongxin, is under criminal investigation in China for multiple serious allegations, including embezzlement and improper relationships. Known as the "CEO monk" for commercializing the 1,500-year-old institution, he has been stripped of his monastic status by China's Buddhist association. This follows a previous investigation in 2015 from which he was cleared, but the current probe has drawn significant public attention and condemnation from the national Buddhist governing body.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have convened in Malaysia for urgent ceasefire negotiations aimed at ending five days of deadly border clashes. The conflict, which has killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, reportedly began after a landmine explosion. Hosted by Malaysia's prime minister, the talks are under international pressure, with the US and China attending as observers, though mistrust remains high as fighting continues along the border.</p>
