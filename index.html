          <p>A Palestinian teacher, who contributed to the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," was shot and killed in the occupied West Bank. An Israeli-American activist at the scene alleges the shooter was a UK-sanctioned Israeli settler, Yinon Levy, who claims he acted in self-defense against a mob. The incident occurred after a bulldozer from a nearby settlement destroyed Palestinian property, escalating tensions. The event is under investigation by Israeli police, who have detained and subsequently released the settler to house arrest.</p>

          <p>A plan by a subsidiary of Nongfu Spring, a beverage company founded by China's richest man, Zhong Shanshan, has generated local opposition in Nashua, New Hampshire. The company acquired an industrial site with the intent to build a bottling plant and purchase surplus water from the city. This proposal has raised concerns among some residents and officials, reflecting a broader shift in U.S. sentiment where Chinese investments are increasingly viewed through a lens of national security, even at a local level.</p>

          <p>Iran has ordered the expulsion of Afghans living in the country without legal status, leading to over 1.3 million people returning to an uncertain future in Afghanistan. The campaign has intensified amid the Israel-Iran conflict, with refugees reporting increased hostility, employment and banking restrictions, and public raids. This mass return creates a significant humanitarian challenge for Afghanistan, which is already struggling with widespread poverty and the restrictive policies of the Taliban government, particularly for women and girls.</p>

          <p>Despite high average credit card interest rates, borrowers should not expect relief following the Federal Reserve's July meeting, as a rate cut is not anticipated. Even if the Fed were to cut rates later in the year, the reduction would likely be too small to significantly impact the high rates tied to consumer debt. The article suggests that with rates remaining high, individuals with substantial credit card debt should proactively explore options such as debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, or credit card debt forgiveness.

The lawsuit argues the provision is a "cruel, backdoor abortion ban" that illegally targets the organization for its advocacy. This legal challenge follows a federal judge's preliminary injunction in a separate lawsuit, which temporarily blocked the defunding measure from taking effect nationwide.</p>
