Republican Sliwa positioned himself as a public safety advocate, criticizing both opponents' platforms and specific policy proposals.

This robust financial performance is primarily attributed to the escalating global demand for artificial intelligence chips, with TSMC producing advanced processors for major clients like Nvidia and AMD. CEO C.C. Wei expressed strengthened conviction in the enduring AI megatrend, leading to an increased 2025 revenue growth forecast and higher capital expenditure for capacity expansion.

          <p>Ace Frehley, the iconic original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, has sadly passed away at the age of 74 following a recent fall. Known affectionately as "Space Ace" and "The Spaceman," Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973, playing a pivotal role in their classic albums and theatrical stage shows, famous for pyrotechnics and elaborate makeup. His former bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, expressed profound devastation, acknowledging his essential and irreplaceable contribution to Kiss's enduring legacy. Frehley also maintained a successful solo career and significantly influenced many 1980s hair metal bands.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of the U.S. military's Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), announced his retirement after 37 years, just over a year into his command. His unexpected departure occurs amidst the Trump administration's controversial anti-drug trafficking mission in the Caribbean, which has involved multiple military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats. Some members of Congress have openly questioned the legal justification for these strikes and their escalating impact on tensions with Venezuela. Senator Jack Reed described Holsey's exit as "troubling," signaling potential instability within the chain of command during a critical period.</p>

          <p>A phone call between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they agreed to meet in person to discuss the Ukraine war, unexpectedly occurred while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was en route to Washington. This development is perceived as an unwelcome "curveball" for Kyiv, which had hoped for increased U.S. military assistance, specifically long-range Tomahawk missiles. Ukraine is currently enduring intense Russian attacks on its infrastructure and a persistent frontline stalemate. The timing and content of the call may complicate Zelensky's efforts to secure more support and could signal a concerning shift in U.S. allegiances.</p>

          <p>China has strategically tightened its grip on global rare earth supplies by implementing sweeping new export curbs, requiring government approval and declared use for products containing these critical minerals. This assertive move, which has significantly impacted the fragile trade truce with the U.S., serves as a stark reminder to President Trump of China's substantial leverage in the ongoing trade war. Rare earths are indispensable for a vast array of technologies, from smartphones to advanced fighter jets, and China maintains a near-monopoly on their processing. Experts anticipate these restrictions will give China a considerable advantage in upcoming trade negotiations, despite U.S. threats of additional tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

While scientists remain skeptical of claims about "sweating out toxins," they readily acknowledge perspiration's vital role in regulating body temperature. The normalization of these discussions helps individuals with conditions like hyperhidrosis feel less shame, though some critics argue it also represents a commercialization of body positivity.</p>

          <p>Two suspects were arrested in Florida for an armed home invasion where they allegedly used an Apple AirTag to meticulously track their victims' SUV to their Odessa residence. Surveillance video captured the chilling moment the men forced a couple into their garage, but they ultimately fled when the house alarm activated. Crucially, investigators discovered the AirTag taped under the vehicle, and the suspects had used their own names to purchase and register it, providing a pivotal break in the case. This incident highlights the dual nature of tracking technology, which can both endanger individuals and aid law enforcement in solving crimes.</p>

          <p>Two cases of a potentially more severe and easily transmissible mpox strain, Clade I, have been confirmed in Los Angeles County, marking its first detection in the U.S. among individuals without a history of international travel to high-risk areas. Both patients required hospitalization but are now recovering at home. Clade I is particularly concerning due to its potential for more severe illness and easier spread through various close personal contacts, including massage or cuddling, beyond sexual activity. While the overall public risk remains low, health officials emphasize continued surveillance, early response, and vaccination efforts, with the two-dose Jynneos vaccine widely available for at-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>Mathis, a small city in southern Texas, is grappling with a severe drinking water crisis as Lake Corpus Christi, its primary source, is nearing critically low levels due to persistent drought conditions. City officials warn that continued water extraction could soon yield only mud, which would damage infrastructure and render the water undrinkable. The lake is currently only 15% full, and the region is experiencing moderate drought, exacerbating the situation. This predicament underscores how human-caused climate change intensifies weather patterns, posing serious risks to essential water supplies and ecosystems globally. Mathis is now urgently attempting to dig emergency wells to secure accessible water for its residents.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon, now a published novelist, discusses her debut thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," co-written with Harlan Coben. She explains her motivation to craft a female protagonist defined by unique skills rather than sex appeal, drawing a contrast with her childhood observations of James Bond films. Witherspoon, who also leads a production company focused on complex female storytelling, believes Hollywood still requires more such roles. The article touches upon her own career setbacks and subsequent resurgence, reflecting on the continuous nature of creativity and personal growth beyond specific age milestones.</p>

          <p>Uganda's Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit, is increasingly perceived as President Yoweri Museveni's private army, instrumental in securing his 39-year rule and perpetuating his family dynasty. The SFC, previously commanded by Museveni's son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, faces accusations from critics of abducting, torturing, and killing opposition activists, allegations the unit denies. Analysts fear its escalating influence, specialized training, and ethnic composition could trigger a power struggle within the military post-Museveni. Despite opposition calls for its disbandment, a recent legislative amendment formally recognized the SFC, solidifying its dominant and controversial role in Uganda's militarized power structure.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings forecasts that China's extensive property market will continue its decline at least through the end of 2026, with nationwide primary property sales expected to fall by 8% in 2025 and an additional 6-7% in 2026 due to persistently soft demand. This ongoing downturn will exert significant pressure on Chinese developers, many of whom are struggling to deliver homes while simultaneously meeting their substantial debt obligations. For instance, Cifi announced a comprehensive plan to restructure its existing debts, issuing new bonds and making cash payments to creditors to strengthen its capital structure and reduce offshore obligations.

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, is set to retire at year's end, less than a year into his typical three-year posting, amidst escalating U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean and heightened tensions with Venezuela. Reports suggest underlying tension between Holsey and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, with Holsey reportedly having raised concerns about the mission and the controversial drug boat attacks. Senator Jack Reed characterized the unexpected departure as "troubling," issuing a warning against military intervention in Venezuela without explicit congressional authorization. This event is seen in the context of other high-profile military leadership changes within the Trump administration.</p>

The couple was ambushed in their apartment's Jacuzzi, where Morales was fatally stabbed over 18 times with a machete in a dispute over a rifle sale. Prosecutors detailed how the assailants, shouting gang allegiance, chased Morales through his building.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, a highly unusual public admission, intensifying pressure on the Nicolás Maduro government. This decision coincides with ongoing U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, B-52 bomber flights near Venezuela, and the sudden retirement of a key U.S. admiral. Maduro, whose legitimacy is contested, condemned the actions as "warmongering" and "CIA-orchestrated coups," appealing directly to the U.S. people for peace and mobilizing Venezuelan forces. The U.S. justifies its actions by citing drug trafficking and migration, though some question the legality and supporting evidence.</p>
