          <p>Brazilian police arrested two Lady Gaga fans, one an adult and one a teenager, who were allegedly planning a bomb attack at her free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were apprehended as part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation by the Brazilian Justice Ministry, Federal Police, and digital intelligence services. Authorities claim the suspects intended to use improvised explosives, but no explosives were found during the operation. Despite the threat, Lady Gaga's historic performance proceeded without incident, drawing over two million fans.</p>

          <p>A psychologist studying couples has identified the phrase 'Why can't you be more like [other person]' as a particularly damaging statement in relationships. This comparison, whether to an ex, friend, or even a past version of the partner, undermines feelings of worth and security, leading to insecurity issues. The root cause of this behavior is often a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations. Open communication and acceptance are vital for a healthy relationship, with partners needing to feel safe enough to voice their needs directly rather than resorting to comparisons.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ+ health, impacting research on cancers and sexually transmitted infections, according to The New York Times.

Scientists argue these cuts create a hierarchy of patients and will lead to outbreaks of sexually transmitted illnesses.

          <p>A New York Times article examines innovative approaches to addressing the affordable housing crisis by retrofitting underused single-family homes into multi-unit dwellings. Developer Monte Anderson's 'roommate house' in Dallas, divided into four studio apartments, exemplifies this concept, offering affordable living spaces in a market dominated by luxury rentals. Cities and states are increasingly encouraging such initiatives by easing regulations on accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and lot subdivisions. These strategies aim to add housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption, providing a quicker and less expensive solution than new construction.</p>

          <p>Business figures are paying tribute to Warren Buffett following his announcement of retirement as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, handing over the role to Greg Abel. Jamie Dimon, the JP Morgan chief executive, said Buffett represented "everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself”. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said that there had never been anyone like Buffett, and that countless people, himself included, had been “inspired by his wisdom”. Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors gathered at the annual meeting that “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war”.</p>

After decades during which active stock pickers have often been exposed as "closet indexers" in their funds — in effect buying up what the index holds more than distinguishing their portfolios from benchmarks — it is important for investors to identify funds that are taking a unique approach, and how that approach is structured. The trend is that as more money shifts into active, it's critical for investors to not overreact to short-term swings in the market. (not investment advice)</p>
