          <p>China announced it will hold a military parade in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, featuring President Xi Jinping delivering a speech. The parade will showcase advanced combat capabilities, including unmanned intelligent systems, underwater combat units, cyber and electronic forces, and hypersonic weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to attend the event, which is part of a series of ceremonies marking the war anniversary. China will also hold ceremonies on July 7 to commemorate the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and on December 13 to mourn victims of the Nanjing massacre.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a decline as an Iran-Israel ceasefire eased concerns regarding supply disruptions in the Middle East. The Ice Brent contract decreased by 2.41% to $69.76 per barrel, while the front-month August Nymex WTI contract fell by 2.42% to $66.85 per barrel. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital route for oil shipments, remains a risk, though analysts suggest oil prices could surge past $100 per barrel in such a scenario. The International Energy Agency has reassured markets that it possesses 1.2 billion barrels of emergency stockpiles to mitigate supply disruptions, and OPEC+ producers have been increasing output.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced a ceasefire agreement with Iran, potentially halting recent aerial attacks that have heightened regional instability. An Iranian diplomatic source also confirmed the agreement, with Qatar, Russia, and Turkey mediating the deal. The ceasefire followed confusion after U.S. President Donald Trump claimed a "complete and total" cessation of hostilities. The conflict began after Israel attacked Iran on June 13, leading to retaliatory missile strikes by Tehran, which resulted in casualties on both sides; Trump also announced that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had "completely and totally obliterated" them. </p>

          <p>Royal experts have noted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's silence following sexual assault allegations against Tyler Perry, the godfather to their daughter, Princess Lilibet. Derek Dixon is suing Perry for $260 million, alleging sexual harassment, assault, and retaliation. Some experts suggest the couple's silence reflects a lack of moral courage and self-serving behavior, potentially damaging their standing in Hollywood and royal circles. Perry provided the couple refuge in his Los Angeles home after their royal exit, and experts are questioning their lack of support for him during this time. </p>

          <p>As global temperatures rise and heatwaves worsen, cities are appointing "heat officers" to build resilience through urban greening and cool zone creation. These officers analyze local conditions, develop plans, and implement protective measures, including heat-repellent sidewalks and roofs. The Atlantic Council initiated the concept in 2021, recognizing the impact of extreme heat on billions by 2050. Cities are incorporating heat resilience into planning for streets, squares, and buildings, with some countries passing laws mandating the appointment of heat officers. </p>

          <p>The body of the final person missing from a boat that capsized on Lake Tahoe during a sudden thunderstorm was recovered, bringing the death toll to eight. Ten people were aboard the 27-foot vessel when it flipped near D.L. Bliss State Park due to high waves. Two people were rescued immediately and taken to a hospital. The intensity of the thunderstorm surprised forecasters, with winds exceeding 35 mph and waves swelling over 8 feet. </p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health and human services secretary, released a report detailing the challenge of the USâ€™s health. However, his plan to "Make America Healthy Again" is criticized for omitting the two leading causes of death for American children: gun violence and road traffic accidents. The article highlights that American children are more likely to die from guns and road accidents than children in comparable countries. The author argues that addressing these issues requires systemic policy changes and confronting realities head-on, but they are absent from Kennedy's plan. </p>

The market is potentially getting jaded at Trump policy changes, with each successive change resulting in less significant market movement.

          <p>Germany may face financial challenges as NATO allies consider a higher defense spending target of 5% of GDP. The country currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, and increasing to 5% would require additional tens of billions of euros annually. Experts suggest this increase would likely necessitate loans, funding cuts, and potential tax increases. The new rules in Berlin mean that defense expenditures above a certain threshold are exempt from Germany's so-called debt brake, which limits how much debt the government can take on and dictates the size of the federal government's structural budget deficit.

          <p>Thomas Lee Gudinas, convicted of the 1994 sexual assault and murder of Michelle McGrath, is scheduled to be executed in Florida. Gudinas was convicted in 1995, and his attorneys have filed appeals arguing that his lifelong mental illnesses exempt him from execution. The Florida Supreme Court denied the appeals, stating that the case law does not apply to individuals with other forms of mental illness or brain damage. This execution is part of a trend in 2025, which is set to have the most executions since 2015. </p>
