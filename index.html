          <p>Ukrainian forces have reportedly killed Major General Mikhail Gudkov, the deputy commander of Russia's navy, in a missile strike. This tactical success for Ukraine comes at a time of heightened anxiety, as the Trump administration announced a pause on some weapons deliveries to Kyiv. The move has created uncertainty among NATO allies and prompted Ukraine to seek clarification from the U.S. about the future of its defense support. The White House has not specified the scale of the reduction, leaving allies and Ukrainian officials concerned about the war's trajectory.</p>

          <p>American televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, a prominent and controversial figure in the 1980s, has passed away at the age of 90. His powerful ministry, which reached 140 countries, famously crumbled after two separate sex scandals in 1988 and 1991. Known for his emotional, "hellfire" preaching style and denunciations of rivals, Swaggart's fall from grace was a major event in the history of televangelism. His legacy is a complex mix of immense influence, financial success, and public hypocrisy that ultimately overshadowed his religious empire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Des Moines, Iowa, to kick off the "America250" events, a yearlong celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The choice of Iowa, the traditional first state in the Republican presidential nominating process, is seen as symbolic of his connection to the American heartland. While the visit is officially for the anniversary event, it also fuels speculation about the future of the Republican party, even as the 22nd Amendment prevents Trump from running in 2028.

          <p>The United States economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, with significant gains seen in the government and health care sectors. Despite this strong performance, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year due to potential impacts from trade tariffs. The robust job growth makes it likely the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates for the time being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While current high-yield savings accounts offer slightly higher returns on paper, their variable rates are expected to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed rate, offering protection against future rate drops. Given the high probability of a Fed rate cut, securing a competitive CD rate now could prove more beneficial over the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill also makes the current estate tax exemption permanent at a higher threshold.

          <p>The House is set to vote on a sweeping Republican legislative package that extends many of the 2017 tax cuts and enacts key second-term priorities for President Trump. The bill includes over $46 billion for border wall construction, new restrictions and work requirements for Medicaid, and a rollback of numerous green energy tax incentives. To partially fund these measures, the legislation makes significant cuts to social programs like SNAP.

From worries about dancing and bare legs in the 1920s to critiques of hippies in the 1970s, the pattern of generational judgment is consistent. The author reflects on this tradition, questioning how to write about generational trends with empathy and nuance rather than condescension.

          <p>In a court hearing for Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, the lead prosecutor detailed the key evidence that solved the case. Investigators used a Q-tip from his family's trash to obtain a paternal DNA match to a sample found on a knife sheath at the crime scene. Cell phone data placed Kohberger near the victims' home multiple times before the attack, and surveillance video captured his car fleeing the area. While the evidence trail is now clear, Kohberger's motive for targeting the victims remains a mystery.</p>

His journey from being overlooked to playing for a top club like Liverpool made him an inspiration in Portugal, proving that success is possible regardless of one's origins.

          <p>A 90-day freeze on broad new U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new trade deals are not finalized, steep "reciprocal" tariffs could be imposed on imports from dozens of countries, adding to the baseline 10% duty already in effect. While the Trump administration has announced agreements with nations like China and Vietnam, many others remain unresolved.
