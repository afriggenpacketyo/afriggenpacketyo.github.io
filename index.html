          <p>A severe heatwave is impacting over 30 million people across the Western United States, bringing record-high temperatures and heightened wildfire risks. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for parts of California, Oregon, Washington, and the desert Southwest, with some areas experiencing triple-digit heat. Portland recorded 102 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking a 1942 record, and one participant in a running event was hospitalized due to the heat. California Governor Gavin Newsom has preemptively deployed firefighting resources to mitigate potential blazes exacerbated by the hot, dry conditions.</p>

          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell discussed the declared man-made famine in Gaza City, warning of its imminent spread and the devastating impact on children. She stated that approximately 18,000 children have died in Gaza since October 7th, equating to nearly a classroom of children daily, primarily due to insufficient food and lack of aid access. Russell also highlighted the severe humanitarian crisis in Sudan, describing it as the world's largest displacement crisis with widespread sexual violence and a cholera outbreak.

This win marks a significant mental hurdle overcome after previous first-round exits and a withdrawal due to injuries. The British No. 1 showcased newfound confidence and a solid performance, demonstrating her growth under new coach Francisco Roig. Raducanu's consistent play against lower-ranked opponents has been crucial to her steady rise in rankings, setting the stage for a potentially tougher second-round challenge.</p>

          <p>The political landscape for the 2026 midterm elections is proving exceptionally difficult to forecast, mirroring the increasing unpredictability of recent cycles. Historically, the President's party often loses seats, but various factors, including potential redistricting efforts by both Republicans and Democrats, could significantly alter the playing field. The article highlights the current slim Republican House majority and the potential impact of President Trump's popularity, or lack thereof, on voter sentiment. With 15 months until the polls, a myriad of unforeseen events could yet shape the electoral outcome, making precise predictions nearly impossible.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, visiting Kyiv for Ukraine's Independence Day, declared that only Ukraine and its allies, not Russia, would decide future security guarantees. He urged an immediate ceasefire to halt the conflict and condemned Moscow's aggression, emphasizing NATO's view of support for Ukraine as collective defense. Carney stressed that if Russia's actions go unchallenged, aggression could spread further. His statements underscore a firm Western stance against Russian influence over Ukraine's sovereign decisions regarding its security future.</p>

          <p>Internal correspondence reveals that numerous Jesuit officials in the 1970s and 1980s were aware of Donald B. Dickerson's repeated sexual assaults of children, yet he was still ordained a priest. The documents, part of a pending Louisiana lawsuit, detail how leaders struggled to contain his abuse while he continued to harm minors. Despite warnings and psychological reports, Dickerson was ordained and later faced multiple allegations and lawsuits. This raises serious questions about the accountability within the order, particularly as former superior general Pedro Arrupe, who was involved in discussions about Dickerson, is now being considered for canonization.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new legislation next month that would allow courts to impose pub and travel bans as part of community sentences. These changes aim to broaden the types of penalties for various offenses, extending beyond specific crimes like football violence. The proposed sentencing bill also includes measures to reduce short prison sentences to ease overcrowding and a scheme for early release of well-behaved inmates. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood confirmed that serious offenders, including those jailed for terror offenses, would not be eligible for early release, with new technology and increased probation officer recruitment expected to support the reforms.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul its asylum appeals system to reduce delays and decrease reliance on migrant hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the creation of a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite appeal hearings, which currently average over a year with 51,000 cases pending. The Refugee Council, however, argues that reducing initial decision errors is the most effective way to clear the backlog, as nearly half of appeals overturn original rulings. The policy change comes amid ongoing public protests across the UK regarding the housing of asylum seekers in hotels, highlighting growing frustrations and safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Biographer Michael Wolff has revealed that US President Donald Trump's unique sleeping habits led to confrontations with his White House staff and the Secret Service. According to Wolff, Trump insisted on having a lock installed on his bedroom door, which the Secret Service removed due to security protocols requiring easy access to the President. Another incident involved Trump reacting strongly when White House domestic staff changed his bedsheets. These anecdotes, previously detailed in a 2019 biography, offer a glimpse into the President's personal preferences and the challenges of accommodating them within the strictures of presidential security.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has ordered the evacuation of over 586,000 people as Typhoon Kajiki approaches, expected to make landfall early Monday with winds up to 166km/h and potentially strengthening further. Flights have been canceled, and boats recalled to shore, with residents in central provinces advised to stay indoors. The storm is forecast to bring 300-400mm of rain and storm surges of 2-4 meters, raising fears of devastation similar to Typhoon Yagi last year. Soldiers have been deployed to assist with the evacuations and emergency preparations.</p>

          <p>Three young sisters, aged nine, 11, and 17, drowned in a dangerously overcrowded rubber boat carrying migrants across the central Mediterranean. The vessel, which departed from Libya's Zuwara, began taking on water in rough seas, leading to panic and chaos among the 65 people on board. Rescuers from German charity RESQSHIP found the bodies, while the girls' mother and brother were among those saved. Many survivors suffered severe chemical burns from seawater and petrol, highlighting the extreme dangers faced by migrants seeking safety, with over 700 deaths recorded this year in the central Mediterranean route.</p>

His defiant address followed reports of a Russian drone attack on the Kursk nuclear plant, which Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation attributed to Russian manipulation. Both sides confirmed a prisoner swap, exchanging 146 soldiers each, including journalist Dmytro Khilyuk. International support was evident with Canadian PM Mark Carney pledging $2 billion in military aid, and US envoy Keith Kellogg attending ceremonies, while King Charles and the UK government also expressed solidarity, extending military training for Ukrainian soldiers.</p>

          <p>US nuclear sanctions against China, including the blacklisting of China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) and equipment license suspensions, have paradoxically strengthened Beijing's nuclear industry. Despite these stringent measures imposed over national security concerns, China has achieved advanced capabilities and 'incredible' industrial scale. This progress stands in stark contrast to the costly delays and atrophied supply chains plaguing nuclear expansions in the US and Europe. Experts warn that excluding China's efficient industry threatens to hinder the West's own atomic energy revival, emphasizing the need for a balance between global cooperation and local participation in the nuclear supply chain.</p>

A new online database provides detailed profiles of 16,000 victims, systematically documenting their names, experiments, and institutions involved. The Lancet Commission's 2023 report revealed the extensive involvement of medical professionals in atrocities, with few held accountable post-WWII. Data from these inhumane studies, on topics like cold tolerance and chemical weapons, was used and cited for decades, with some specimens still found in research institutes until systematic reappraisal began in the 1980s and 90s.

The piece highlights declining public trust, self-censorship among faculty and students, and the undermining of tenure protections.
