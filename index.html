          <h2>Food Companies Reduce Ingredients in Response to Consumer Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 10:05:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food manufacturers are simplifying ingredient lists due to growing consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, spurred by books like "Ultra-Processed People." Retailers are seeing increased demand for products with fewer ingredients, leading brands to launch less-processed options. However, some nutritionists caution against prioritizing shorter ingredient lists over nutritional value, as fortified nutrients may be omitted. Experts advise food brands to streamline formulas and explore new processing technologies to maintain nutritional retention and extend shelf life, noting that marketing will likely emphasize the benefits and justify higher prices of less processed foods.

The author asserts that the poverty and insecurity in these nations are largely due to US military and economic intervention, including sanctions and coercion.

          <h2>UK Support for Morocco's Western Sahara Claim Angers Algeria</h2>

          <p>The UK has shifted its position to endorse Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara, angering Algeria, which supports the Polisario Front's independence efforts. The British Foreign Secretary described Morocco's proposal as the "most credible" position, a departure from London's previous support for a UN referendum. This move aligns the UK with other Western countries backing Morocco's claim. Experts suggest the UK's decision is driven by economic interests and Morocco's growing significance as a gateway to Africa. </p>

          <p>Families traveling abroad this summer are being warned about a rise in measles cases in Europe and other regions. Measles infections in Europe are at a 25-year high, and cases are also surging in countries such as Pakistan and Nigeria. Childhood vaccination rates in the UK are below the recommended 95% uptake, with the lowest regional rates found in London. The UK Health Security Agency is urging holidaymakers to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccinations, emphasizing that it is never too late to get vaccinated. </p>

          <p>Hiring slowed in May but remained steady as businesses expressed concerns about uncertainty related to President Trump's shifting tariff policies. The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' expectations, while the unemployment rate held at 4.2%. Federal government employment declined due to the Department of Government Efficiency. Companies like Pepsi, Goldman Sachs, and Walmart have warned of potential losses due to the tariffs.
