          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are delaying hiring or not replacing departing employees, leading to a decrease in job vacancies. Between March and May, available jobs decreased by 63,000, while the unemployment rate saw a slight increase, signaling a weakening labor market. Some firms may be holding back on recruitment due to increased employer National Insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage, and this could lead to a further rise in the unemployment rate in the coming year. Average wage growth slowed to 5.2% between February and April, but it remains above the rate of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disorder broke out in Ballymena following a protest over an alleged sexual assault, with people wearing masks throwing masonry at police and setting houses on fire. Jim Allister, MP for North Antrim, condemned the violence as "unwanted and unwarranted," attributing the demonstration to demographic changes due to "unfettered immigration." Two teenage boys appeared in court accused of the sexual assault, with their solicitor stating they would deny the charges. Hundreds participated in a peaceful march earlier in the day before the violence erupted, and police are investigating the incidents.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have entered their fourth day, with tensions escalating as thousands of protesters took to the streets. Demonstrations included blocking a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire, prompting law enforcement to use tear gas and rubber bullets to control the crowds. The state of California has sued the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard without consulting Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the move "illegal and immoral." As of Monday, 53 people have been arrested on various charges, and police are reminding everyone that they must comply with the California Values Act, which limits their assistance in federal immigration enforcement activity.</p>

          <p>Israel has begun deporting 12 pro-Palestinian activists, including Greta Thunberg, after their Gaza-bound aid boat was seized by Israeli forces. The Israeli foreign ministry stated that Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on a flight to France after agreeing to be deported, while other activists refused to sign deportation orders. The activists were attempting to deliver a "symbolic" amount of aid to Gaza, defying Israel's naval blockade to highlight the humanitarian crisis there. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition condemned the activists' kidnapping as unlawful and a violation of international law, and the incident has renewed scrutiny of Israel's blockade of Gaza.</p>

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," fearing it could lead to foreign investors withdrawing from U.S. stock markets. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the bill, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. equities. The ICI suggests that the U.S. fund management industry, with around $18 trillion invested in U.S. stock markets, would be "collateral damage" and that the current drafting of Section 899 should be clarified to avoid discouraging foreign investment. Foreign investors own significant amounts in U.S. stock markets, government bonds, and credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to restrict international students from enrolling in U.S. universities could undermine the role of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a magnet for global talent. Research indicates that a significant percentage of top U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) companies have immigrant founders, including former international students. Restricting international students could compromise the talent pool for U.S. graduate schools, as about half of U.S. STEM PhDs are conferred on international students. While overseas applications for graduate positions in the U.S. are decreasing, more American students are exploring academic options abroad, and this could compromise human capital.</p>

          <p>Temu and Shein are shifting their focus to Europe as their business in the U.S. faces challenges from unfavorable trade policies, and complaints have been filed against them in the EU over business tactics. The EU is preparing a new two-euro flat fee on previously customs-free small packages from online marketplaces. Consumer spending on Temu in the U.S. fell about 36% in May, while Shein's fell 13%, but both platforms have seen increased ad spending and consumer spending growth in Europe. Experts say the EU's potential duties on small-value packages may signal more pressures to come for Temu and Shein.</p>

          <p>China's relations with Niger have faced strains since the 2023 coup, despite Beijing's efforts to strengthen ties with the military government. A dispute arose when Niger expelled Chinese oil executives and revoked the license of a Chinese-owned hotel over discriminatory practices. Niger also ordered China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to terminate the contracts of expatriate employees with over four years of service, and these disputes underscore the limits of Beijing's non-interference policy. Observers note that China's approach incurs economic costs, especially as some nations experience a rise in nationalism, while China's policy entails regime strengthening.</p>

The government will step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across various fields.

Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that pressured by import tariffs imposed by the U.S., Chinese manufacturers are shipping more to factory sites in nearby Southeast Asia to produce goods for sale locally or in Western countries, including the U.S., with factories often injecting enough local content to declare re-exports as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.
