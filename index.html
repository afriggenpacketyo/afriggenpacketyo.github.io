        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has acknowledged authorizing the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, a move that has escalated tensions with the South American nation. Trump cited Venezuela's alleged release of prisoners into the U.S. and the flow of illicit drugs as the primary reasons for the authorization. This confirmation follows increased U.S. military presence in the Caribbean, which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has condemned as a policy of aggression and a potential prelude to a U.S.-led regime change effort. The action marks a significant development in the strained relationship between the two countries, raising concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to halt the purchase of Russian oil, a significant step in the U.S. effort to economically pressure Russia over the war in Ukraine. Trump stated the cessation would occur within a short period, calling it a "big stop." In response, an Indian government spokesperson indicated that discussions are ongoing, emphasizing the priority of safeguarding consumer interests. The move is part of a broader U.S. strategy to cut off Moscow's energy revenue, with similar pressure being applied to other major buyers like China and Japan, who have so far resisted.</p>

          <p>The Guide Dogs charity in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has welcomed its largest litter in three years, a group of 13 puppies affectionately nicknamed "the Baker's Dozen." The puppies, born to mother Yori, have all been given bakery-themed names such as Biscuit, Crumpet, and Apple. This national breeding center, the largest of its kind globally, produces around 1,300 guide dogs annually with the help of dedicated volunteers. The 13 new arrivals will soon be placed with puppy raisers across the UK, beginning their journey to become life-changing assistance dogs by 2027.</p>

Many supporters praised him for his public display of faith, citing biblical passages about facing hatred for one's beliefs. Conversely, other users criticized Hart for amplifying what they described as a right-wing media talking point, showcasing the divisive nature of public figures engaging with religious and political topics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released its final report on the June 2023 Titan submersible disaster, concluding that faulty engineering and a failure to meet safety requirements led to the fatal implosion. The report states that the vessel's carbon fiber hull contained anomalies and had sustained damage on previous dives, which weakened the structure. The NTSB criticized OceanGate, the submersible's owner, for inadequate testing and for not following standard emergency response protocols, which could have located the wreckage sooner. The findings echo a prior Coast Guard report that described the incident, which killed all five people aboard, as preventable.</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has lowered its 2026 economic growth forecast from 1.2% to 0.9%, attributing the downgrade to the "heavy burden" of punitive tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. As an export-driven economy, Switzerland has been significantly impacted by the 39% tariffs on its goods, which places its exporters at a competitive disadvantage in the U.S. market. Officials noted that global demand for Swiss products is expected to rise only modestly, with persistent uncertainty dampening economic activity. The rising value of the Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven currency, is further compounding the country's economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the current ceasefire in Gaza provides immediate relief, this article argues that long-term peace remains precarious, largely due to the political position of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The analysis posits that Netanyahu's political survival relies on an alliance with far-right factions and a strategy of avoiding genuine peace negotiations, which would require difficult compromises. As long as he remains in office, he is expected to obstruct the implementation of ambitious peace proposals, such as a pathway to Palestinian statehood. Therefore, Israel's upcoming elections are presented as a critical juncture that could determine whether the region moves toward a lasting settlement or another cycle of conflict.</p>

          <p>A formal inquiry is being launched in the UK after a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The collapse of the case has raised serious questions, especially after witness statements from a senior national security official were published, detailing that China presents the "biggest state-based threat" to the UK. Critics accuse the government of allowing the case to fail to protect economic relations with Beijing, a claim the government denies. The inquiry will investigate why the prosecution was halted despite evidence that some officials believed was sufficient for a trial.</p>

The case concerns a Louisiana congressional map that was redrawn to include a second majority-Black district to comply with the act, a move now being challenged as discriminatory against non-Black voters. This article suggests a ruling against the current map would effectively end the VRA's power to combat racial gerrymandering, continuing a trend seen in previous decisions like Shelby County v.

          <p>In a symbolic gesture, the British Library has reissued a reader's card in the name of famed Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after his original was revoked. Wilde was barred from the library's reading room in 1895 following his conviction for "gross indecency" due to his homosexual relationships, which were criminalized at the time. The library stated the new card is intended to "acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering" he faced. Wilde's grandson, Merlin Holland, will collect the card on what would have been the writer's 171st birthday, calling it a "lovely gesture of forgiveness."</p>

          <h2>Analysts Question Feasibility of Disarming Hamas in Post-Ceasefire Gaza</h2>

          <p>Despite the new ceasefire agreement's goal of disarming Hamas, the group is already reasserting control in Gaza, executing rivals and deploying its fighters on the streets. This article explores the significant challenges to demilitarization, as Hamas views its weapons as essential for its political and military survival. Analysts suggest that without a substantial political incentive, Hamas is unlikely to agree to disarmament, rendering external security guarantees insufficient. The situation is complicated by the lack of a clear plan for who will manage Gaza's internal security, creating a power vacuum that Hamas is actively filling.</p>

The decision puts 247 employees at risk of redundancy, with 29 shops closing in the UK and 28 in the Republic of Ireland. The parent company, Flutter UKI, attributed the closures to increasing cost pressures and challenging market conditions. While the company stated it would offer redeployment opportunities where possible, it acknowledged that the move will inevitably lead to job losses.</p>

          <p>The recent war between Israel and Iran, which ended after a U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, has exposed Tehran's military weaknesses and left it in a state of geopolitical indecision. The conflict, combined with the loss of key allies like Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, has crippled Iran's "Axis of Resistance" network across the Middle East. With its regional influence diminished, Iran is now facing internal criticism and an offer of negotiations from the U.S. However, the regime's ideological rigidity and inability to make decisive diplomatic moves leave its future path uncertain.</p>

          <p>An emergency room doctor warns that impending cuts to Medicaid and the expiration of federal insurance subsidies will trigger a crisis for the U.S. healthcare system. The article argues that as millions of people lose their health coverage, they will be forced to use emergency rooms for primary care, a role for which ERs are ill-equipped and already over-strained. This shift will lead to patients presenting with more advanced, expensive conditions that could have been managed cheaply with regular care. The author contends that this will not only cause immense human suffering but also drive up costs for everyone, as hospitals pass on the expense of uncompensated care.</p>

Legal experts and former officials express concern that the law could be used to quell political opposition, noting it provides almost untrammeled power with little room for judicial review.
