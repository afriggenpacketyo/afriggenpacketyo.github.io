          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has emerged as a prominent critic of his party's major spending bill, arguing it breaks President Trump's promise not to cut Medicaid. In a forceful speech, Tillis stated that the legislation would lead to devastating funding cuts in his state, affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Despite his opposition and retirement announcement, he has assured colleagues he will not surprise or undermine the Republican conference. Tillis claims his analysis, supported by bipartisan and non-partisan state groups, shows a potential $26 billion cut for North Carolina, a figure he says the Trump administration has dismissed without providing contrary evidence.</p>

          <p>Record-breaking summer temperatures are intensifying concerns over the safety of outdoor and indoor workers, with reports of increased heat-related hospital visits and multiple fatalities. Labor advocates have highlighted dangerous conditions for employees at companies like Amazon, while others such as UPS are taking steps to install air conditioning in their vehicle fleets. In response to the growing danger and the absence of a national policy, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has proposed a new federal rule. This regulation would mandate employer-provided water and rest breaks during periods of extreme heat, aiming to establish a consistent safety standard across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) presents a timely borrowing option this July due to several favorable conditions. With interest rates on HELOCs having decreased from their recent highs, they offer a more affordable way to access large sums of money compared to other forms of credit. The approval process is often faster than for unsecured loans, as the home serves as collateral, and the variable rates could become even more advantageous with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year. A key benefit is the flexibility to draw funds as needed and only pay interest on the amount used, which is particularly useful in the current transitional economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged over 300 individuals in its largest-ever coordinated healthcare fraud enforcement action, involving an alleged $14.6 billion in fraudulent claims. The schemes spanned the country and included medical professionals who billed for unnecessary treatments, such as providing medically unjustified skin grafts to terminally ill hospice patients for financial gain. One major international operation, dubbed "Operation Gold Rush," targeted a transnational criminal organization involved in a $10 billion Medicare and money laundering scheme. Officials emphasized that these crimes exploited vulnerable patients and taxpayer-funded programs, and they urged the public to report any suspected healthcare fraud.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is considering a version of a major tax and spending bill that would end popular tax credits for electric vehicles by September 30th, much earlier than the House version proposed. This potential accelerated repeal has drawn criticism from EV advocates and even auto dealers, who warn of market disruption and consumer confusion. Conversely, opponents of the credits argue they are giveaways to the wealthy, citing the lack of income restrictions on credits for leased EVs. The draft bill represents a significant blow to the green energy sector, though it is still subject to amendments and reconciliation with the House bill. (not investment advice)</p>

The event, hosted by President Trump, will also feature a flyover of B-2 Spirit bombers, the same type of aircraft used in the strikes against Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites. The operation involved a 36-hour round-trip flight from Missouri and was described by the administration as a major success in setting back Iran's nuclear program. While preliminary intelligence suggested a modest setback, some officials now claim new information indicates the program was delayed by years.</p>

The acquisition will be carried out by Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, which will purchase all GMS shares for $110 each.

Abrego Garcia's case has become a focal point in the debate over U.S. immigration policy, as he held a legal status protecting him from removal due to likely persecution in El Salvador.

Over seven weeks, prosecutors presented evidence, including graphic testimony from ex-girlfriends and video footage, arguing that Combs used violence and fear to coerce women into sexual encounters.

          <p>Oracle's stock price climbed to an all-time high following the disclosure of a new cloud services agreement expected to generate over $30 billion in annual revenue. According to a regulatory filing, CEO Safra Catz was set to announce the massive deal, with revenues anticipated to begin in the 2028 fiscal year. This news has bolstered investor confidence, contributing to a more than 33% rise in the company's shares this year. The surge is also fueled by Oracle's growing involvement in artificial intelligence, including recent partnerships with OpenAI and IBM to expand AI infrastructure and capabilities.

          <p>A proposal to tax money sent abroad by individuals without Social Security numbers, currently before the U.S. Senate, is being criticized as a counterproductive policy. While intended to deter illegal immigration and raise revenue, the article argues it would likely drive billions of dollars into unregulated financial channels like cryptocurrency, complicating law enforcement's ability to track illicit funds. The tax could also damage diplomatic relations with countries like Mexico that heavily depend on remittances and destabilize their local economies. Ultimately, the policy risks undermining financial transparency and national security for what is projected to be a relatively small fiscal gain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deep cuts and new restrictions to Medicaid proposed in the Republican-led spending bill could cause millions of Americans to lose health coverage, according to health policy experts. The bill includes an estimated $1 trillion reduction in federal Medicaid spending and imposes 80-hour monthly work requirements on many recipients, which could disproportionately affect older adults who face health issues or age discrimination. Healthcare advocates also warn that the funding cuts could force the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers that heavily rely on Medicaid revenue. These changes would go against President Trump's previous promises to leave the program intact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a significant price surge over the past 18 months, the price of gold is expected to remain relatively stable throughout July. Key economic factors that typically influence gold, such as inflation and interest rates, are not anticipated to see major shifts. With inflation holding steady and the Federal Reserve likely to keep interest rates paused until at least September, major price fluctuations are unlikely. While unpredictable geopolitical tensions remain a wildcard that could drive investors toward the safe-haven asset, the current outlook suggests a period of consolidation for the precious metal's price.

The deal ensures that the genetic information of 15 million customers will remain under similar privacy policies and management, with the stated goal of using the data for medical research.

          <h2>Federal Investigation Concludes Harvard Violated Civil Rights of Jewish Students</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Health and Human Services has found that Harvard University violated the civil rights of its Jewish and Israeli students. An investigation by the Office for Civil Rights concluded that these students were subjected to "severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment" following the October 7 Hamas attack. The letter alleges a pattern of unchecked discrimination and states that Harvard's response demonstrated "deliberate indifference." The university, which strongly disagrees with the findings, now faces a potential referral to the Department of Justice for a federal lawsuit if it does not achieve voluntary compliance.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Faces Internal Pressure Over Proposed Changes to Disability Benefits</h2>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a potential backbench rebellion over proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a key disability benefit. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall defended the reforms after the government made a concession, stating that stricter eligibility criteria would only apply to new claimants after November 2026. However, many Labour MPs are questioning the logic of setting new criteria before a planned review of the assessment process is complete. The government argues the changes are necessary to make the welfare system sustainable, while opponents worry it will create a two-tier system and balance the budget on the backs of the poor.</p>

          <p>A deadly ambush in northern Idaho saw a gunman intentionally set a brush fire to lure first responders into a trap, where he then opened fire, killing two firefighters and wounding a third. The incident occurred on Canfield Mountain, a popular recreational area near Coeur d'Alene. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris stated the attack was a "total ambush" carried out by a sniper with a high-powered rifle concealed in the rugged terrain. After an hours-long standoff and a search guided by cellphone data, authorities located the suspect deceased on the mountain with a weapon nearby, though the cause of his death has not been released.</p>

          <h2>Market Commentary Reflects on First Half of 2025, Advocating for Continued Investment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reflecting on the first six months of 2025, market analysis suggests that staying invested despite volatility has been the correct strategy. The market's recovery from an early-year dip, prompted by fears of President Trump's tariff policies, serves as a key lesson. The article posits that Trump's aggressive negotiating style often leads to outcomes less severe than initially threatened, creating buying opportunities for disciplined, long-term investors. Instead of panicking over headlines, investors are advised to focus on corporate earnings and fundamental trends, such as AI and cybersecurity, which are likely to see continued growth regardless of trade disputes.
