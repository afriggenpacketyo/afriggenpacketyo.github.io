          <p>North Korea plans to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia's Kursk region, signaling deepening cooperation between the two nations. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu announced Kim Jong Un's decision to dispatch 1,000 sappers for mine clearance and 5,000 military construction workers for infrastructure restoration. Kim expressed unwavering support for Russia's efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, though the exact number of North Korean troops sent to Russia remains undisclosed. South Korea, the U.S., and Japan have voiced concerns over the growing ties, fearing the transfer of advanced technologies to North Korea in exchange for labor and military support.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan recorded a trade deficit of 637.61 billion yen in May, driven by a decline in auto-related shipments to the United States, potentially influenced by higher tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Overall exports decreased by 1.7% year-on-year, marking the first drop in eight months, with shipments to the U.S. falling by 11.1%. The trade balance remained negative for the second consecutive month, reflecting the impact of trade uncertainties and protectionist measures. These trade dynamics are affecting Japan's economic performance.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Southern California are living in fear following increased ICE activity since the beginning of Donald Trump's second term. ICE operations have become more aggressive, targeting various cities and causing widespread anxiety among undocumented individuals. The article recounts personal stories of immigrants affected by these raids, including a couple seeking work at a Home Depot who witnessed ICE agents detaining people. Experts suggest that the anti-immigrant policies have reduced the flow of people migrating to the U.S., as potential migrants no longer see it as a viable destination.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team has indicated a potential shift in trial strategy as prosecutors wrap up their case, shortening their presentation time. Legal experts suggest this change may reflect perceived weaknesses in the prosecution's case, which relies heavily on testimony from ex-girlfriends and ex-employees. Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, with potential sentences ranging from 15 years to life in prison if convicted. The trial has included the presentation of videos and text messages related to alleged offenses.</p>

          <p>Australia has become the first country in the world to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, a move praised by LGBTQIA+ advocates. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will now be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The changes, which will begin taking effect next month, aim to address the growing global demand for plasma while promoting inclusivity.</p>
