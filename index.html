          <h2>Southwest Airlines to Initiate Checked Bag Fees and Modify Fare Structure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 07:45:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, introducing a $35 fee for the first checked bag and $45 for the second, effective Wednesday. This change comes after pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which sought significant business model changes. Certain exemptions apply, including for Rapid Rewards loyalty members, Business Select fare customers, and those with Southwest co-branded credit cards. Additionally, Southwest is launching a new Basic fare that restricts ticket changes, prioritizes later boarding, and shortens fare credit expiration, while discontinuing the Wanna Get Away fare. The airline anticipates increased carry-on luggage and is installing larger overhead bins to accommodate this shift.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food inflation has reached a yearly high of 2.8% due to increased beef and fresh produce prices, according to the British Retail Consortium. Steak restaurant chain Fazenda has already increased its prices by about 2% to offset rising costs, with beef prices having surged by 20% in the last 12 months. Farming industry experts attribute the beef price increase to high demand and low supply, compounded by insufficient government support. The British Meat Processors Association warns that supermarkets can no longer absorb cost increases, and consumers will inevitably face higher prices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to sever ties with Harvard University by canceling all remaining federal contracts, totaling approximately $100 million, citing a lack of commitment to nondiscrimination and national values. A letter from the U.S. General Services Administration instructs federal agencies to list contract cancellations by June 6, transitioning critical services to alternative vendors. This action follows previous freezes on grants and contracts and attempts to restrict international student enrollment. Harvard is fighting back in federal court, challenging the administration's demands regarding student ideology and diversity, arguing that they infringe upon First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Former Congolese President Joseph Kabila's recent reappearance in a rebel-held area of the Democratic Republic of Congo has ignited political tensions, particularly after criticizing President Felix Tshisekedi's government for removing his immunity. Tshisekedi's administration has accused Kabila of siding with the M23 rebels, leading to a ban on Kabila's political party. Some observers fear Kabila's involvement could undermine mediation efforts, while others argue that including him in talks is crucial for the country's stability. Kabila, who served as president from 2001 to 2019, has publicly denounced Tshisekedi's leadership, citing corruption and mishandling of the conflict in eastern DRC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's European vehicle sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, despite overall battery electric car sales rising by 34.1% in the region. This decline is attributed to reputational damage stemming from CEO Elon Musk's political associations and increasing competition from traditional automakers and Chinese companies like BYD. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve. The company launched an upgraded Model Y, but its overall lineup is aging, further impacting its market position in Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and the UK are urging G7 partners to lower the oil price cap on Russian oil, currently set at $60 per barrel, as part of an 18th package of sanctions against Russia. The goal is to reduce Moscow's revenue from legitimate seaborne crude oil sales, but the Trump administration is reportedly hesitant, citing falling oil prices already impacting Russia. Experts emphasize that better enforcement of the existing cap is crucial, highlighting issues like attestation fraud and the need for credible pricing data from buyers. Despite the challenges, the EU and UK remain committed to intensifying sanctions to exploit Russia's economic vulnerabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. rose by an estimated 76% year-over-year in April, while shipments from China fell by approximately 76%, according to data from Canalys. This surge reflects Apple's strategy to adapt to Washington's tariffs against China by increasing its manufacturing capacity in India. However, analysts predict this growth may plateau due to India's limited manufacturing capacity and potential protectionist measures from both Washington and Beijing. Despite Trump's exemption of iPhones from reciprocal tariffs, he has threatened tariffs on all iPhone shipments if manufacturing does not occur domestically.</p>

Factors such as the pandemic, the rise of smartphones, inflation, and the Trump presidency may be contributing to this divide.

Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh suggested the idea, aiming to provide a more engaging conclusion for fans. The 2017 series against New Zealand ended in a draw, which was considered anticlimactic. Super Rugby Pacific has already introduced 'golden point' for regular-season games, with a 10-minute extra time period, while knockout games use standard extra time followed by 'golden point' if needed.</p>

          <p>Following an incident in Liverpool where a car rammed into a crowd, injuring dozens, Merseyside Police quickly released details identifying the driver as a 53-year-old white British man. This decision was calculated to prevent the spread of misinformation, as false reports circulated after a previous incident in Southport. In that earlier case, delays in releasing the suspect's identity led to widespread erroneous reports and subsequent riots.

          <p>A bear sighting on the golf course led to the cancellation of the final round of the Twinfields Ladies tournament in Japan, marking the second wildlife-related disruption in recent golf events. Reina Maeda, who led after the second round, was declared the winner. The decision to cancel the round was made to ensure the safety of players and spectators, as human encounters with bears have reached record levels in Japan due to climate change and depopulation. The government has approved a bill allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas.</p>

          <h2>Manufacturing Jobs: Are They Still Special in the US Economy?</h2>

          <p>Politicians have focused on boosting manufacturing in the U.S., raising the question of what makes these jobs so special. While some economists dismiss this as nostalgia, data suggests that manufacturing still pays a premium, particularly in advanced sectors. A recent study found that workers moving from restaurants to manufacturing receive a 35% pay bump, higher than many other industries. However, the unionization rate in manufacturing has declined, and the attractiveness of factory work is debated. The presence of expensive machinery and the need for specialized skills contribute to the higher pay in this sector.</p>
