          <h2>US Administration Announces Steep Tariffs on Copper and Pharmaceuticals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 14:25:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports and up to 200% on imported pharmaceuticals. The copper tariff announcement caused an immediate spike in copper prices and the stock value of domestic miners like Freeport-McMoRan. While the copper tariff's start date is unspecified, pharmaceutical companies may be given a grace period of up to 18 months to move production to the U.S. before the steep duties take effect. These sector-specific tariffs are part of a broader trade strategy aimed at reshoring key industries and are separate from previously announced reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help it counter Russia's intensified attacks. In a notable shift, Trump expressed sharp frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that Putin's assurances have been "meaningless" and accusing him of not treating "human beings right." This decision comes after the Trump administration had previously sought to de-escalate the conflict and scaled back aid provided by the previous administration. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has ordered his officials to intensify contacts with the U.S. to secure these critical defense supplies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for orchestrating a sophisticated IT worker scheme. The operative is accused of recruiting North Korean IT workers who used stolen American identities to gain remote employment at global companies. This fraudulent activity generated hundreds of millions of dollars, which were then funneled to support North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The sanctions also target four other entities, including a Russia-based network, as part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt the regime's illicit funding channels.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media company, X, has stated that the Indian government ordered the platform to block 2,355 accounts within the country, including that of the Reuters news agency. According to X, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology demanded the immediate blocking of these accounts without providing any justification. This event marks the latest escalation in an ongoing legal conflict between X and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over censorship. X sued the Indian government in March, accusing it of unlawfully expanding its power to remove online content, a move that clashes with Musk's self-proclaimed "free speech absolutist" stance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its long-standing requirement for most travelers to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints. The rule, in place since 2006, was a response to the 2001 "shoe bomber" incident. While an official national announcement is pending, several airports have already begun allowing passengers to keep their footwear on, leading to some confusion among travelers. Proponents of the change, including former TSA officers, believe modern screening technology is sufficient to ensure safety and that the new policy will significantly speed up security lines, enhancing the passenger experience.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece characterizes the recent deployment of federal agents in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park as a performative "Battle of the Photo Op" rather than a serious enforcement action. The author argues that the massive show of force, complete with Humvees and agents on horseback, was a farce that did little to address actual crime, instead frightening the community and wasting taxpayer money. The article contends that these raids, part of a month-long operation under the Trump administration, primarily target non-criminals and are intended to intimidate immigrant-friendly cities. It concludes that the strategy is more about spectacle and political messaging than effective immigration policy.</p>

Prominent pro-Trump figures have called for Bondi's resignation, accusing the administration of a lack of transparency.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With Americans facing record credit card debt and high interest rates, debt consolidation is an increasingly attractive option for managing finances. This strategy combines multiple debts into a single payment, often at a lower interest rate, which can lead to significant savings and a faster payoff timeline. However, it's important to consider all options beyond personal loans, such as 0% APR balance transfer cards or formal debt consolidation programs. Prospective borrowers should also be aware that there are limits on the amount and type of debt that can be consolidated, and eligibility for the best rates depends heavily on one's credit profile.

The study, from the Quincy Institute and Brown University's Costs of War program, describes this as a massive wealth transfer from taxpayers to arms manufacturers like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The analysis notes that the U.S. military budget is set to surpass $1 trillion annually under the Trump administration, continuing a trend of escalating spending.

          <p>New research from UC San Diego reveals that feral western honeybees, non-native descendants of domesticated bees, now constitute about 90% of the bee population in San Diego's coastal scrubland, a global biodiversity hotspot. These dominant honeybees are monopolizing pollen resources, effectively squeezing out native pollinators like bumblebees. The study found that honeybees can remove over 80% of a flower's pollen in a single day, leaving little for native species that are often more effective at pollinating native plants. While not an argument against honeybees, which are vital for agriculture, the findings highlight a growing ecological imbalance and the need to manage their populations to protect native ecosystems.</p>

As search efforts continue for the missing, families and schools are sharing tributes to their loved ones, remembering them as bright lights known for their joy, kindness, and spirit.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and professionals have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital denounce inflammatory comments made by one of its partners, Shaun Maguire. Maguire, a supporter of President Trump, posted on X that New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and is advancing an "Islamist agenda." The letter calls for Sequoia to condemn the remarks, apologize, and implement a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech. The incident highlights growing tensions within the tech and venture capital community over political speech and religious bigotry.</p>

          <h2>Tax Experts Refute Claim That New Bill Eliminates Federal Taxes on Most Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 13:35:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tax experts are correcting a misleading claim from the Social Security Administration that President Trump's recent budget bill eliminates federal income taxes for nearly 90% of beneficiaries. The legislation does not directly eliminate the tax on benefits but introduces an additional deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors, which may indirectly reduce their overall tax liability. However, this new deduction is income-dependent and phases out for higher earners, meaning many seniors will not benefit. Experts also note that the changes will reduce tax revenue flowing into the Social Security trust fund, potentially weakening the program's long-term solvency. (not investment advice)</p>

Chef Alisa Reynolds, known for her modern, L.A.-influenced take on Southern comfort food, cited numerous challenges including financial losses from the pandemic, industry strikes, and recent immigration raids in the area. The restaurant was a beloved neighborhood anchor and was listed among the city's best, helping to popularize a new style of soul food in Los Angeles. Reynolds plans to focus on catering, pop-ups, and product development, but the closure marks a significant loss for the local culinary scene.</p>

          <p>On "The Daily Show," Jon Stewart sharply criticized parent company Paramount Global for paying $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview. Stewart, along with guest and former correspondent Steve Kroft, characterized the payment as a "shakedown" or "protection money" intended to ensure Trump's FCC does not block Paramount's pending merger with Skydance Media. The lawsuit, which 1st Amendment experts called frivolous, claimed CBS News unfairly edited an interview with Kamala Harris. Stewart argued the move felt like a demand for fealty rather than legitimate legal action, highlighting the immense pressure on news organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve shows that consumer fears about future inflation have subsided significantly, returning to levels seen before the Trump administration's tariff announcements. In June, respondents' median expectation for inflation one year from now fell to 3.0%, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. This decline suggests that public concern over tariffs leading to a sharp spike in prices has eased as the administration has taken a more conciliatory negotiating stance. While the overall inflation outlook improved, consumers still anticipate notable price increases for specific categories like medical care, college, and rent. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major reversal of a 70-year-old policy, the IRS has indicated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. The filing states that communications from a house of worship to its congregation on political matters, when viewed through a lens of faith, do not violate the Johnson Amendment. This amendment has long barred nonprofits from engaging in partisan political campaigning. The new interpretation comes in a proposed settlement of a lawsuit brought by religious groups and aligns with President Trump's long-standing call to repeal the restriction, potentially reshaping the role of religion in politics.</p>

The city's mayor described firefighters as "waging guerrilla warfare" to defend the city, and residents have been urged to stay indoors. The blaze, which authorities say was sparked by a car fire, has burned approximately 700 hectares, leading to the evacuation of dozens of homes and the closure of Marseille Provence airport. This fire is part of a series of wildfires breaking out across a heatwave-stricken southern Europe, with other major incidents reported in Spain and Greece.</p>
