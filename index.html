          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, former physician to President Biden, repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a House Oversight Committee deposition. The committee sought to question him about Biden's fitness for office and potential cover-ups regarding his health. Committee Chairman James Comer suggested this implies criminal liability, while Democrats defended the doctor's right to confidentiality and criticized the proceeding as political. O'Connor's lawyers stated the move was necessary due to an ongoing Justice Department investigation and to protect patient confidentiality, which could risk his medical license.</p>

          <p>David Gergen, a prominent political adviser who served in the administrations of four U.S. presidents from both parties, has passed away at the age of 83. He was known for his bipartisan approach and worked for Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton in various high-level communication roles. Gergen famously coined the question, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” for Reagan's 1980 debate. After his government service, he pursued a successful career in media and academia, founding the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard's Kennedy School.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators participated in the annual Twelfth of July parades across Northern Ireland, commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The events, which celebrate Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage, took place in 18 locations, including a major parade in Belfast. Organizers described the day as a great success with large, peaceful crowds and favorable weather. A small feeder parade in a historically contentious area of north Belfast passed without incident, reflecting a largely positive and celebratory atmosphere for the cultural event.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers end a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani gave up only one hit and struck out four batters, setting a positive tone for the team. While still on a limited workload following Tommy John surgery, his effective outing provided a crucial spark for the struggling Dodgers. Bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan followed with 4 ⅓ innings of one-run ball to secure the much-needed win for the team.</p>

While this trend is often viewed as worsening the demographic crisis, some experts argue it may not be entirely negative.

Legal experts quickly noted that the president has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that protects this constitutional right.

          <p>In what was dubbed the "Shortest Call in Ramsey Show History," financial radio host Dave Ramsey gave blunt advice to a 20-year listener named Chad. The caller, a real estate agent with $211,000 in cash and a $95,000 mortgage, asked if he should pay off the house. Ramsey's immediate response was, "Good Lord. Pay it off today," ending the call in under a minute. The exchange perfectly encapsulated Ramsey's financial philosophy, which prioritizes the emotional freedom of being debt-free over potential mathematical gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions flared between England and India at the end of day three of their Test match at Lord's over perceived time-wasting tactics. England opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the final over, successfully ensuring his side only had to face one over instead of a potential two before the close of play. India's players reacted angrily, but England's bowling coach Tim Southee defended the move, pointing out that India's captain had engaged in his own delays earlier in the match. The incident added a layer of drama to the tightly contested Test.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has quietly pushed back against escalating criticism from the Trump administration by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. This follows accusations from the OMB Director, who called the project an "ostentatious overhaul" as part of a broader attack on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's leadership. The Fed's webpage clarifies that no "VIP dining rooms" are being built and explains cost increases, emphasizing that the project is self-funded and not paid for by taxpayers.

          <p>Police have arrested 71 people across the United Kingdom during protests against the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests, primarily for showing support for a banned group, occurred in London, Cardiff, and Manchester. The proscription, which took effect last week, makes membership or support for the group a criminal offense. Critics, including the group's legal team, have argued that the government is misusing terror legislation and that the ban is an "authoritarian abuse" of power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary report on last month's fatal Air India crash has led one aviation analyst to suggest a chip malfunction could be the root cause. The report indicated the plane's engine fuel cutoff switches moved almost simultaneously, starving the engines of fuel. Aviation expert Marco Chan noted that a previously issued service bulletin from the engine manufacturer warned of a flawed chip that could cause signal loss, effectively cutting off fuel. This theory points away from pilot error, as the switches are designed to prevent accidental movement during flight.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the dismissal of all federal charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah plastic surgeon accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccines and selling fake vaccination cards.

In her announcement, Bondi stated that Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so."
