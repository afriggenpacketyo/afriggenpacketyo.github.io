        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German consumer protection group has initiated legal action against several budget airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, over their policies on hand luggage fees. The group argues that charging for reasonably sized hand luggage is an inadmissible fee that misleads consumers about the true cost of flights. The lawsuit is based on a 2014 European Court of Justice ruling that deemed hand luggage a fundamental necessity of air travel, not an optional extra, and is part of a broader European campaign.</p>

          <p>Germany's Justice Minister has announced plans to introduce a new regulation allowing for the use of electronic ankle tags to monitor violent offenders, particularly to protect women from partners or ex-partners. The system is based on the Spanish model, where the distance between an offender and a victim is monitored electronically. A draft bill is expected after the summer, which would empower family courts to order the use of these tags as a preventative measure against domestic violence.</p>

          <p>The German government has acknowledged slight progress in humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza but insists the amount is insufficient to address the emergency. Berlin is urging Israel to ensure a comprehensive supply of aid, while also expressing serious concern over reports that large quantities are being diverted by Hamas and other criminal groups. The German Security Cabinet has been briefed on the situation, reinforcing the call for more substantial aid to reach the civilian population through the United Nations and other organizations.</p>

          <p>The fashion trend of visible tan lines is making a comeback, popularized on social media, but health experts are raising alarms about the associated dangers. While some influencers promote achieving the look safely with fake tan, many others are intentionally sunburning themselves to create sharp lines, a practice that significantly increases the risk of melanoma. This trend, coupled with online misinformation about sunscreen, is seen by health professionals as a "massive backwards step" for skin cancer prevention.</p>

The student's footage provided a clear view of the incident that was not visible in the officers' body camera videos, prompting civil rights attorneys to highlight its importance. The case serves as a powerful example of how citizen-recorded video can challenge official police reports and expose potential misconduct.</p>
