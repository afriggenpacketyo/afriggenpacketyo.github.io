          <p>A New York Times report has shed light on the events leading up to a fatal helicopter crash near Reagan National Airport in January. The report highlights a moment when the Black Hawk pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, failed to follow her flight instructor's guidance to alter course moments before colliding with a passenger plane, resulting in 67 fatalities. The crew had requested to use 'visual separation,' a common procedure where pilots navigate independently of air traffic control, but the pilot's decision not to turn left exacerbated the risk.
