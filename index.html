          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the contentious nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump and a top Justice Department official, for a lifetime appointment as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. Bove faces staunch opposition from former federal prosecutors and judges, alongside serious allegations of unethical conduct. These include a purported quid pro quo with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and a whistleblower's claim that he suggested ignoring court orders. Despite significant Democratic objections and calls for further testimony, the GOP-led panel pushed the nomination forward, though his confirmation by the full Senate remains unclear.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has dismissed federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, citing Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which outlines presidential powers. Comey served as lead prosecutor in the criminal case against Sean "Diddy" Combs, resulting in convictions for interstate prostitution, and also assisted in the high-profile prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This firing follows her father's termination by President Trump in 2017 and occurs amid a Justice Department investigation into James Comey himself, stemming from a social media post. The decision underscores ongoing political tensions and changes in leadership within the department.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 09:45:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, with CEO Scott Kirby noting a reduction in global uncertainty and a pickup in travel demand. Despite earlier weaker-than-expected domestic flight demand and lower airfares, the airline's premium revenue saw a 5.6% increase year-over-year, indicating a shift in consumer spending. United now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025, offering a more stable outlook compared to its previous dual-scenario forecast that accounted for recessionary environments. Operational constraints at Newark Liberty International Airport, due to air traffic controller shortages, continue to impact its pretax margins, posing a challenge for the company.

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a major high fructose corn syrup producer, fell sharply after President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its U.S. drinks. Trump made the claim in a social media post, praising the alleged move as "just better" and suggesting it would be a very good decision. While ADM's stock saw an initial premarket tumble, it recovered slightly during trading, though it remains down. Coca-Cola, however, did not explicitly confirm the change, issuing a neutral statement about appreciating Trump's enthusiasm and hinting at future "new innovative offerings" within its product range.

          <p>Coca-Cola has publicly defended its use of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) following President Donald Trump's social media claim that he had convinced the company to switch to cane sugar in its U.S. products. Initially, Coca-Cola issued a neutral statement, but later released an additional message promoting HFCS as safe, having similar calories to table sugar, and being metabolized in a similar way by the body. The company cited the American Medical Association's stance that HFCS is no more likely to contribute to obesity than other sweeteners. This public dispute highlights potential trade implications for the U.S. soft drinks market and the ongoing debate around sugar alternatives.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has launched sweeping civil defense exercises across Taipei and several northern cities to test society-wide wartime readiness and urban resilience. The drills, prompted by escalating pressure from Beijing, included air-raid sirens, civilian evacuations, lighting blackouts, and shelter-in-place procedures. Mass rapid transit stations implemented "entry-only" protocols, with passengers instructed to remain underground, effectively transforming the capital into a wartime simulation. These extensive exercises aim to prepare the population for potential conflict, with authorities issuing real-time mobile alerts and imposing fines for non-compliance, underscoring the serious nature of the geopolitical threat.</p>

          <p>Syria's Druze minority has recently been central to renewed conflict, with clashes between local Bedouin groups and Druze escalating into an international incident involving Israeli airstrikes on Damascus. The Druze, a unique Abrahamic religious sect distinct from Islam, number around 700,000 in Syria, primarily in Sweida province. Following the Assad regime's collapse, some Druze leaders support a unified Syria, while others resist centralization, operating their own security forces. The interim Syrian government has pledged to protect the Druze, though their relationship with Israel, which claims to protect them, remains complex, with most Druze rejecting such offers.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the Yale School of Public Health have estimated that the Trump administration's "Big Beautiful Bill," or Trumpcare, could lead to a significant increase in annual deaths. Analyzing the House version of the bill, they projected 42,500 additional deaths annually by 2034, a figure surpassing current breast cancer fatalities. Including the impact of ending enhanced subsidies for people buying their own insurance, the estimate rises to over 51,000 extra deaths per year. The White House has strongly refuted these claims, labeling them "egregious" and "deranged," indicating a contentious debate over the policy's potential health outcomes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two men, Errol Campbell (who died in 2004) and Ronald De Souza, have had their decades-old convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal, after being framed by corrupt British Transport Police officer Det Sgt Derek Ridgewell. Ridgewell, known for orchestrating racist miscarriages of justice, fabricated evidence against mostly young, Black men, leading to their wrongful imprisonment in the 1970s. This ruling brings the total number of overturned cases linked to Ridgewell to 13, out of all referred. The court expressed profound regret for their suffering, and advocates are now calling for a change in law to automatically review cases overseen by police officers later jailed for crimes.</p>

She emphasized that public media is a critical component of emergency response plans in nearly half of U.S. states, particularly in rural areas where local stations receive over 50% of their budget from federal funds. The Senate recently approved $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, following President Trump's executive order alleging partisan bias.

          <p>Southeast Asian nations are concerned about new U.S. tariffs targeting "transshipped" goods, which are re-routed through intermediate locations to avoid higher duties. Under new deals, Vietnamese exports face a 20% tariff, but transshipped goods could incur 40%. The U.S. aims to curb economic relations with China, which is accused of relabeling goods through Southeast Asia. While a narrow definition of transshipment would have minimal impact, a broad definition, including Chinese inputs, could devastate Southeast Asian economies.
