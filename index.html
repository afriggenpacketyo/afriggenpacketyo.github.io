          <p>Two years after initiating a contentious divorce, former 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' star Kim Zolciak and her estranged husband, Kroy Biermann, are rebuilding their lives separately. Biermann, a former NFL player, has transitioned to a new career in crane and rigging sales. Meanwhile, Zolciak has moved into a new home, launched two new TV shows, and has reportedly reconnected with her parents after years of estrangement. The updates suggest a move towards personal stability for both individuals following a period of public accusations and legal battles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite outcry from some prominent conservative figures over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, many Trump supporters across the U.S. remain unfazed and loyal to the president. Interviews in states like Pennsylvania, Florida, and Tennessee reveal that these voters often dismiss the controversy as a politically motivated distraction by Democrats and the media. They prioritize issues like the economy, border security, and cultural grievances, expressing continued trust in Trump's leadership. This sentiment highlights a disconnect between the political elite's focus and the core concerns of a significant portion of the president's base.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the notion of science as a purely objective and apolitical endeavor is a myth that leaves it vulnerable to political attacks and allows it to perpetuate systemic oppression. The authors cite historical examples, such as 19th-century race science, and contemporary biases in evolutionary biology to show how cultural values have always shaped scientific inquiry. Instead of denying this entanglement, the article calls for scientists to honestly confront and integrate political analysis into their work. This approach, they contend, would create a more rigorous, resilient, and just scientific practice capable of resisting misuse by authoritarian forces.</p>

          <p>China has identified a super-large zirconium deposit, estimated at 2 million tonnes, which quintuples the nation's current reserves of the critical mineral. The discovery, located in a terrestrial basin, is a significant strategic gain, as zirconium alloys are essential for advanced aerospace and military applications. These alloys are prized for their extreme heat and corrosion resistance, making them crucial components in hypersonic technology, including scramjet combustion chambers and vehicle nose cones. This find could resolve a key resource dependency for China's rapidly advancing hypersonics race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents a debate between two columnists on whether California should retaliate against Texas's partisan gerrymandering by redrawing its own congressional maps to favor Democrats. One side argues that such a move would betray the will of California voters, who established an independent commission to prevent political self-dealing, and could backfire by escalating a national redistricting war. The opposing view contends that in a moment of existential threat to democracy, abandoning non-partisan principles is a necessary form of "peaceful resistance" to counter authoritarian tactics. The discussion weighs the risks of short-term tactical gains against long-term democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's soccer in Europe, Eastern European nations remain significantly underrepresented at top tournaments like the Euros, with Poland being the sole qualifier in 2025. Experts suggest this disparity stems from a combination of historical, cultural, and economic factors. Societal norms that discourage girls from playing football, a lack of investment, and the collapse of state-sponsorship systems post-communism have hindered development. While UEFA initiatives are starting to show results, the region still struggles with inadequate infrastructure and the rise of political movements emphasizing traditional gender roles, which can make professional sports an unattractive path for women.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Rule Changes to Protect Pubs from Noise Complaints</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering changes to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints. The proposed reforms would require developers building new homes near existing venues to include soundproofing and would also fast-track permissions for new businesses and outdoor dining areas. These changes aim to reverse the decline in the pub industry, which has seen hundreds of closures annually due to economic pressures. While Labour supports the move to bring "vibrancy" to towns, the Conservatives argue that tax policies are the primary cause of the industry's struggles.</p>

          <p>At least six people were killed and more than a dozen injured in a stampede at the Mansa Devi temple in the northern Indian city of Haridwar. The crush occurred on Sunday morning when thousands of pilgrims had gathered at the popular Hindu holy site. Officials report the panic began after a high-voltage electric wire fell onto a temple path, causing devotees to scramble for safety. Deadly stampedes are tragically common at religious festivals and gatherings in India, with this incident being at least the seventh major crush in the country this year.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has introduced a new economic policy aimed at transforming the nation into a self-sufficient, 24-hour economy. The plan involves encouraging key industries like agriculture and manufacturing to operate in three eight-hour shifts daily, keeping the economy running around the clock. The government hopes this initiative will create up to 1.7 million new jobs and reduce unemployment by 5% by the end of the decade. However, economists express concern over the feasibility of the project, citing the need for significant funding, infrastructure improvements like a stable power supply, and buy-in from the private sector.</p>

Analysts are skeptical that the threat will move Vladimir Putin, who may be banking on the U.S. being unable to sustain a coherent policy.
