          <p>The UK government has confirmed a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent 1984 confrontation between police and striking miners in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the inquiry, fulfilling a Labour manifesto promise to address unanswered questions that have persisted for four decades. The investigation will examine the events of the day and the subsequent, discredited criminal prosecutions against 95 miners. Campaigners, who have sought this inquiry for over 13 years, expressed cautious elation, hoping it will bring truth and justice to former mining communities affected by the historic industrial dispute.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has stated he is "100%" confident the club followed correct procedures regarding former player Thomas Partey. Partey was recently charged with multiple counts of sexual assault involving three women, with the alleged offenses occurring in 2021 and 2022 while he was playing for the team. Arteta, speaking at a pre-season press conference, declined to comment on the complex legal matters but affirmed the club's processes were appropriate when questioned by journalists. Partey, who denies the charges, is scheduled to appear in court in August.</p>

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis, the parent company of brands like Jeep and Fiat, announced it anticipates a net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of 2025. The company cited several factors for the downturn, including pre-tax charges, increased industrial costs, and the initial impact of U.S. tariffs, which are expected to account for a €300 million hit. Stellantis also reported a 6% year-on-year decline in second-quarter vehicle shipments, with a significant 25% drop in North America due to reduced manufacturing of tariff-impacted imported vehicles.

          <p>Assets under management in Chinese bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surged to over $50 billion, a fivefold increase since the start of last year.

Investors, including private funds and banks, are drawn to bond ETFs for their lower costs, liquidity, and diversified exposure, particularly to corporate notes from China's technology sector. This trend highlights a broader hedging strategy against economic uncertainty, even as regulators warn about risks from excessive bond rallies. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident occurred early Sunday morning, resulting in the building being declared a total loss. Federal postal inspectors reported that Tillman had spray-painted "Viva La Me" on the building's exterior, though the motive remains unclear. Pat Tillman famously left his NFL career to enlist in the Army and was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004.</p>

          <p>The northeastern Chinese city of Hegang, part of the country's rust belt, is planning to construct a new airport as part of a strategy to revive its struggling economy and increase trade with Russia. With an estimated investment of 1.2 billion yuan, Luobei Airport is scheduled to open in 2027 and is expected to handle 450,000 passengers annually. The city has faced years of economic decline and a shrinking population, with its GDP falling in recent years. This infrastructure project represents a significant gamble by the local government to attract investment and reverse its economic fortunes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fierce price wars are sweeping across multiple industries in China, from electric vehicles to food delivery, as companies compete for price-sensitive consumers. While this leads to ultra-cheap deals, it is squeezing corporate profits and exacerbating deflationary pressures. There are growing concerns that this cutthroat competition comes with hidden costs, potentially compromising product quality and safety as companies cut corners. In response, China's state media and government have begun criticizing the "irrational" competition, signaling a potential shift towards regulating prices and focusing on technological and quality advantages instead.

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a bruising election. Despite the significant setback, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he has no intention of resigning. The election result reflects widespread voter frustration over rising prices, potential U.S. tariffs, and a series of political scandals. This loss of control in the upper house, following a similar defeat in the lower house last year, is expected to undermine the coalition's legislative power and could lead to political instability.</p>

          <p>A spectacular and bizarre accident in the German town of Bohmte has left two people, including a seven-year-old boy, seriously injured. A car reportedly veered off the road at high speed, crashed through a hedge, and landed on a trampoline where the boy was playing. The vehicle then apparently bounced off the trampoline and became lodged in the attic of a nearby barn, about three meters off the ground. The driver sustained only light injuries, but a passenger and the child on the trampoline were seriously hurt, prompting a massive emergency response.</p>

Patients and small-scale studies report that the drugs not only aid in weight loss but also improve other symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and hormone imbalances. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity is key, as it can lower testosterone levels, a primary driver of PCOS symptoms. While larger clinical trials are needed, this development offers hope for a condition that has lacked effective, comprehensive treatments for decades.</p>

According to his wife, McAllister entered the MRI room while her scan was in progress, wearing a 9kg (20 lbs) metal chain he used for weight training. The machine's powerful magnetic field violently pulled him in by the chain, causing a "medical episode" from which he did not recover. The incident is a stark reminder of the extreme dangers posed by metallic objects near MRI machines, which exert powerful magnetic forces.</p>

This divergence is significant as both nations lead in developing power-hungry data centers.

In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed there is significant demand for the old name, which was dropped in 2020 following criticism that it was a racist slur. He suggested he would not approve a deal for the team to build a new stadium on federal property in Washington, D.C. if the name is not changed.
