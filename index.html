          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged that U.S. tariffs are significantly affecting Japanese companies, including automakers. Speaking after the G7 summit in Canada, Ishiba reiterated his commitment to safeguarding Japan's national interests during trade negotiations with Washington, and he emphasized that Japan will not rush into a deal that undermines these interests. Ishiba also mentioned the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, stating that Japan is closely monitoring crude oil and gasoline prices and preparing measures to mitigate any potential impact on daily life. The Prime Minister plans to visit the Netherlands for a NATO summit later in June, further solidifying Japan's ties with the military alliance, but his immediate focus remains on navigating the complex trade landscape amid global economic uncertainties. Optimism around Japan's ability to navigate these challenges is relatively stable. </p>

          <p>U.S. officials indicated that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible or if President Trump might resort to military action. Despite heightened rhetoric, U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weak position and may be compelled to negotiate, potentially leading to a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. The U.S. military is sending additional assets to the region, framed as defensive measures to protect American troops, but also leaving options open for direct assistance in Israel's ongoing operations against Iran. A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers, capable of carrying bunker-buster bombs, to target Iran's underground nuclear facilities. </p>

          <h2>Chinese Humanoid Robot Firms Offer High Salaries Amid AI Talent Shortage</h2>

          <p>Chinese companies in the rapidly growing humanoid robotics sector are offering salaries more than three times the national average to attract top engineers and AI talent. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is approximately 31,512 yuan (US$4386), and even higher for roles requiring more experience. This reflects a deepening talent crunch in the industry, even as the broader job market faces pressures from slowing economic growth. The soaring pay in humanoid robotics stands out amid widespread lay-offs and pay cuts in other sectors. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could see a resurgence in UK waters as rising ocean temperatures prompt species to shift habitats, according to scientists. A new study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, revealing that many could find new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the long-living ocean quahog clam, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas as species' habitats change. </p>
