          <p>Following statements from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Donald Trump announced he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in strategic regions. Trump characterized Medvedev's comments as "highly provocative" and stated the military maneuver was a precautionary measure in case the remarks were more than just inflammatory rhetoric. He emphasized the importance of words and their potential for unintended consequences, expressing hope that this situation would not escalate further. The announcement was made via a post on his Truth Social platform.</p>

          <p>Amid growing international moves to recognize a Palestinian state, this article examines the complex process of what defines a state in international law. It outlines the criteria from the 1933 Montevideo Convention, which includes a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity for international relations. The article also details the crucial role of diplomatic recognition and the difficult path to full UN membership, which requires Security Council approval without a veto from permanent members. Ultimately, it highlights that statehood is a fluid, politically charged process rather than a simple legal checklist.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man, Jon Ruben, has been charged with three counts of wilful ill-treatment of a child following an incident at a summer camp in Stathern, Leicestershire.

Leicestershire Police launched an investigation after receiving reports of children becoming unwell at the camp. The Crown Prosecution Service has reminded the public that the accused has the right to a fair trial, as criminal proceedings are now active.</p>

          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a key funder for public media outlets like NPR and PBS, has announced it will wind down its operations. This decision follows the complete elimination of its federal funding by the Trump administration and Congress. President Trump signed an executive order to cease funding, and Congress later approved clawing back $1.1 billion in previously allocated funds. CPB President Patricia Harrison stated the organization faces the difficult reality of closing, with most staff positions concluding by the end of the fiscal year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman publicly explained their recent dissents against the decision to maintain the current interest rate. Both officials argued for a quarter-point rate cut, stating that waiting to ease policy poses a significant risk to the U.S. labor market and overall economy.

While proponents say it opens up communication, critics argue that real change must come from tech companies and regulation, not just monitoring tools.</p>

          <p>An overnight incident in Santa Barbara resulted in three people being stabbed during the city's annual Old Spanish Days Fiesta. Police on patrol were alerted to a man with a knife on State Street shortly after midnight and discovered the three victims. All three were transported to a local hospital, with their conditions not immediately released. Authorities have stated that the incident appears to be isolated and does not pose an ongoing threat to public safety. The investigation is continuing as the weeklong festival proceeds.</p>

          <p>Businesses globally are grappling with the impact of new U.S. tariffs, which have reshaped America's trading relationships. The response has been varied: Mexico received a 90-day reprieve, providing temporary relief, while Thailand secured a lower-than-feared rate of 19%. In contrast, Brazil was hit with a steep 50% tariff, and Switzerland faced a surprisingly high 39% rate. European nations negotiated a 15% rate for most goods, which is still a significant increase that has prompted calls for EU compensation from some industries.</p>

          <p>Advocates for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) coverage are questioning the status of a campaign promise from Donald Trump to make the treatment accessible for all. During his campaign, Trump pledged to pay for or mandate insurance coverage for IVF, but an executive order signed in February fell short of that, instead directing a policy council to make recommendations by May. That deadline has passed with no update from the White House. With out-of-pocket costs for IVF being a major barrier for many families, advocates and patients are waiting to see if the administration will follow through.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy, visited a controversial U.S.-backed aid distribution site in Gaza to assess the humanitarian situation. The visit to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site, which has been the location of numerous reported civilian deaths, was described by some Gazans as a "media stunt." Human rights groups have criticized the militarized aid system, while the GHF and Israel defend their operations. The visit occurs amid dire warnings of mass starvation from UN agencies and ongoing ceasefire negotiations that have stalled.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, led by California, is suing the Trump administration over an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for minors. The lawsuit argues the order, which directs the Justice Department to investigate providers of such care, is an unconstitutional attack on LGBTQ+ patients and states' rights. The legal action follows the issuance of federal subpoenas to clinics nationwide and the subsequent closure of some prominent gender clinics. The states are asking a federal court to vacate the order, which they claim is intended to discourage lawful, life-saving healthcare.</p>

Busey, 81, acknowledged in a virtual court hearing that the contact was not accidental. He now faces one to five years of probation and fines, with a sentencing hearing scheduled for September.</p>

Trump had called Hawley a "second-tier" senator after allegedly being told by others that the bill would force him to sell his properties, like Mar-a-Lago. Hawley clarified that he spoke with Trump and explained the legislation exempts existing assets and would only apply to the next president, not the current one. According to Hawley, Trump accepted the explanation, stating the senator was "exonerated."</p>

          <p>Liverpool has indicated it is willing to walk away from a deal for Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak after its opening offer of £110 million was rejected. Newcastle is reportedly valuing the 25-year-old Swedish international at around £150 million and maintains he is not for sale. It remains unclear if Liverpool's stance is a negotiating tactic or a final decision. Isak, who is currently training separately from the Newcastle squad, is said to be interested in exploring a move away from the club despite its qualification for the Champions League.</p>

          <p>A new Department of Energy report, intended to support the rollback of climate regulations, is being heavily criticized by mainstream climate scientists as a "farce" filled with misinformation. The report, which claims climate change is a "challenge – not a catastrophe," was released as the EPA proposed undoing the 2009 "endangerment finding" that allows for greenhouse gas regulation. Critics argue the report was crafted by a small group of handpicked authors with fringe views, cherry-picks data, and ignores the overwhelming scientific consensus documented by bodies like the UN's IPCC.</p>

          <p>According to a report from a tech watchdog, Google has removed more than 50 organizations related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from its public list of funded groups. The purge is part of a larger change where 214 groups were dropped and 101 were added. This move aligns with a broader trend of companies, including Google, scaling back on DEI commitments amid cost-cutting and a shifting political landscape hostile to such programs. A Google spokesperson stated the list changes annually and doesn't reflect all company contributions.</p>
