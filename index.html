          <p>An Iraqi man, Akeel Abdul Jamiel, has been charged with illegally voting in the 2020 presidential election in South Glens Falls, NY.

Jamiel, who is not a U.S. citizen, registered as a member of the Conservative Party about a month before the election.

          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab can eliminate tumors in some early-stage cancer patients, potentially allowing them to avoid surgery. The study found that 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer needed an operation. The research focused on patients with tumors that had a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic problem that makes cells more responsive to immunotherapy. While promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital and requires further investigation to confirm long-term efficacy and applicability to a broader range of cancer types.</p>

The government also proposes reducing the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. The exemption for milk-based drinks was initially included due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the Treasury now believes the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar.

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to reinstate Columbus Day under its original rules, dates, and locations, amidst a cultural clash with Indigenous Peoples Day. Trump criticized Democrats for attempting to destroy Christopher Columbus's reputation and the Italian American community's love for him. While Columbus Day remains an official federal holiday, many now celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day, acknowledging the contributions of Native American populations. Some Italian American groups have praised Trump's message, viewing it as profoundly symbolic.</p>

          <p>Experts are suggesting that male health workers should be allowed to perform mammograms to alleviate staff shortages in the field. The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to a critical vacancy rate among mammographers. Currently, breast screening examinations are exclusively performed by female staff. While some women may be hesitant, others believe that if it can save lives, the gender of the radiographer should not matter. The SoR is also discussing whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening program.</p>

He warned that imposing high retaliatory tariffs permanently would be disastrous for the state of Texas and the country as a whole.</p>

He anticipates a robust labor report, making it difficult for the economy to slip into a full-blown recession soon.</p>
