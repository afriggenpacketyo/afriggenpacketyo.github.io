            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that the El Salvadorian government initially obstructed his access to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland. Van Hollen believes the government staged photos during their meeting to portray Abrego Garcia as comfortable, despite his confinement in a notorious prison. Abrego Garcia was later moved to a different facility following Van Hollen's intervention. The senator emphasized the importance of upholding constitutional rights for all, even those facing deportation, and urged the Trump administration to present evidence linking Abrego Garcia to gang activity in court rather than through social media.

            <p>Ukraine and Russia blamed each other for violating the Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin, with both sides claiming the other launched attacks overnight. Zelenskyy accused Russia of attempting to create a false impression of a ceasefire, while Russia's Defense Ministry stated that Ukrainian forces launched attacks in the Donetsk region. Trump said that negotiations are "coming to a head" and hoped for a deal this week. The failure to observe the ceasefire underscores the deep-seated conflict between the two nations.
