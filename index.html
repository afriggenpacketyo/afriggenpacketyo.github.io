          <p>LGBTQ+ soldiers serving in the Ukrainian armed forces are fighting for both their country and for legal recognition of their rights. While many report neutral or supportive reactions from comrades, systemic issues persist, such as the inability to register same-sex partnerships, which denies partners legal rights in cases of injury or death. A bill to legalize civil partnerships has been stalled in parliament for over two years, and advocates are also pushing for stronger laws against hate crimes. Despite these challenges and instances of harassment, there is growing societal support for LGBTQ+ equality in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title after being banned from the previous year's event. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes, securing his 17th victory in the men's competition. The win comes after a well-publicized dispute with organizers over a partnership with a rival plant-based food company prevented his participation in 2024. Reigning women's champion Miki Sudo also defended her title, eating 33 hot dogs and buns for her 11th win.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history, primarily because it introduced the concept of the "citizen." He argues that while the Declaration of Independence's promises did not initially apply to women, people of color, or the poor, its inspirational words set in motion a global movement for equality. Burns emphasizes the importance of embracing America's complicated history, stating that understanding these complexities enriches the national story and allows everyone to find a place within it. His upcoming film, "The American Revolution," aims to explore these multifaceted narratives.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned in the United Kingdom after a High Court judge denied a request to temporarily block the government's proscription order. The ban, which amends the Terrorism Act 2000, makes it a criminal offense to support or be a member of the group, with penalties of up to 14 years in prison. The government's decision follows actions claimed by the group that caused significant damage at an RAF base. Opponents of the ban argue it is an authoritarian move against a civil disobedience group that does not advocate for violence.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global has settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million, ending a contentious legal battle over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. Trump had alleged the interview was deceptively edited and sought $20 billion in damages. The settlement, which includes Trump's legal fees and a contribution to his future presidential library, was seen as crucial for Paramount to secure regulatory approval for its sale to Skydance Media. While Paramount avoided a much larger payout and did not issue an apology, the deal highlights the intense pressure the company faced.</p>

          <p>Health experts are highlighting the potential short-term and long-term health consequences of competitive eating, as exemplified by the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest. A 2007 study showed that a competitive eater's stomach can expand massively, losing its ability to contract and empty properly. Ingesting dozens of hot dogs in minutes introduces extreme levels of calories, fat, and sodium, which can spike blood pressure, strain the kidneys, and cause severe gastrointestinal distress. While the long-term effects are not well-studied, immediate dangers include choking, esophageal tears, and in rare cases, death.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old man in the UK has been sentenced after encouraging a vulnerable woman he met online to kill herself for his "sexual gratification." Tyler Webb was the first person charged under a new provision of the Online Safety Act for encouraging serious self-harm. The court heard he instructed the woman on how to harm herself and asked for images, later attempting to watch her suicide attempt on a video call. The victim's bravery in reporting the "calculated psychological violence" was praised by police and prosecutors, leading to Webb's hybrid sentence in a mental health facility and prison.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian international soccer player Thomas Partey has been charged in the United Kingdom with five counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual abuse. The charges, brought by three women, relate to incidents alleged to have occurred between 2021 and 2022. Partey, a 32-year-old defensive midfielder whose contract with Premier League club Arsenal recently expired, is scheduled to appear in court in August. Through his lawyer, Partey has denied all charges and stated that he has cooperated fully with the police investigation and looks forward to clearing his name.</p>

          <p>An internal European Parliament audit alleges that the now-defunct far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group may have improperly spent at least €4.3 million in EU operational funds. The investigation, by a consortium of journalists, uncovered what it calls "unjustified and potentially unlawful" transactions, including donations to politically affiliated charities and contracts with companies linked to far-right figures. The spending, which is prohibited under EU rules, allegedly benefited organizations connected to parties like France's Rassemblement National and Germany's AfD. Critics argue the scandal highlights systemic weaknesses in the EU's financial oversight.</p>

          <p>In Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, mobile air defense units are engaged in a relentless, nightly battle against waves of Russian Shahed drones. Using older, heavy machine guns, these territorial defense soldiers, many of whom are local civilians, attempt to shoot down the modern, low-cost drones that terrorize their communities before heading deeper into Ukraine. The constant struggle, described by one commander as "Groundhog Day," takes a psychological toll as the war grinds into its fourth year. The region faces a dual threat from these aerial attacks and a build-up of Russian ground forces along the border.</p>

          <p>In a Fourth of July social media post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated he feels "politically homeless," asserting that the Democratic party no longer champions a "culture of innovation and entrepreneurship." Altman, a proponent of what he calls "techno-capitalism," argued for policies that both encourage wealth creation and ensure its wide distribution. He expressed a preference for candidates who focus on raising everyone's standard of living rather than on eliminating billionaires. His comments appeared to be a response to a New York City mayoral candidate who recently stated that billionaires should not exist.</p>

          <p>A 90-day freeze on a wide range of U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant uncertainty for consumers and businesses. If new trade agreements are not finalized, sharply higher import duties on goods from dozens of countries will automatically take effect. The Trump administration has announced deals with China and the U.K., but the status of negotiations with many other nations remains unclear. Economists warn that the implementation of these "Liberation Day" tariffs could reignite inflation, harm smaller companies, and destabilize financial markets, though some experts believe extensions are likely for certain countries.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade pact with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on products transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. This move is widely seen as an effort to crack down on Chinese manufacturers who use Vietnam as a hub to circumvent higher U.S. tariffs on direct Chinese exports. While the deal aims to curb this practice, economists note that enforcement will be challenging, as it requires defining what constitutes a "made in Vietnam" product versus a transshipment. The deal signals the administration's strategy of using bilateral agreements to pressure China's supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the maker of the popular Labubu dolls, is facing potential regulatory headwinds after Chinese state media criticized the "blind box" toy model for encouraging addictive spending among children. Despite the warning, which caused a temporary dip in its stock, analysts believe the company will remain resilient as its primary demographic is young adults, not minors. The company's rapid growth, fueled by a "dopamine economy" of affordable collecting, has been bolstered by significant overseas expansion. However, it still faces challenges like counterfeit products and production delays amid its soaring popularity.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban's government in Afghanistan, becoming the first nation to do so since the group seized power in 2021. The move, which involved Moscow removing the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations and accepting an ambassador's credentials, was welcomed by China. The Taliban hailed the decision as a "historic step" and a positive example for other countries. However, the recognition has been condemned by former Afghan officials and human rights advocates, who view it as the legitimization of an oppressive regime that violates human rights, particularly those of women.</p>
