          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has disrupted the Democratic Party's efforts to assess his presidency and the 2024 election. While many express sympathy, some Democrats privately question the timing of the announcement and whether his health was concealed during his time in office. Former Representative Dean Phillips suggested the diagnosis was revealed to deflect criticism, while physicians raised concerns about when Biden might have learned about his condition. The article highlights the complex mix of concern and lingering distrust surrounding Biden's health and legacy. ()</p>
