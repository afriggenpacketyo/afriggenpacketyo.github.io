            <p>Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley held a town hall meeting in Fort Madison, Iowa, where constituents voiced concerns regarding the Trump administration's policies, including deportation operations and tariffs. Audience members expressed disapproval of the administration's refusal to comply with court orders, particularly concerning the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a prison in El Salvador. Grassley defended the administration's actions, stating that the president of El Salvador is not subject to U.S. Supreme Court orders. Constituents also raised concerns about the potential impact of Trump's tariff policies on Iowa farmers, to which Grassley responded that it was too early to make a definitive judgment.

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children in the U.S. have been identified with autism, a significant increase from previous years, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. citing the findings as evidence of a growing "epidemic." CDC scientists suggest the rise in diagnoses could be attributed to improved screening and access to autism services. The study also notes higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to factors like preterm birth and lead poisoning. The report comes amidst increased federal spending on autism research and renewed debate over potential environmental factors contributing to the condition.</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, and the Justice Department met in federal court after the Supreme Court ruled the administration must facilitate his release from a Salvadoran prison. Despite the ruling, the Trump administration has argued its obligations are limited to removing domestic obstacles to his return, claiming it cannot force El Salvador to release him. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele stated he lacks the power to return Abrego Garcia, further complicating the situation. Abrego Garcia's lawyers are seeking to hold the government in contempt for failing to comply with court orders, highlighting the ongoing legal battle over his unlawful deportation. </p>

The report also highlights racial/ethnic disparities, with lower prevalence among white children compared to other groups. HHS Secretary Robert F.

The trial, expected to last two months, will determine whether Meta operates as an illegal monopoly and could potentially lead to the divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp, significantly impacting the company's advertising business. Meta argues that it faces ample competition from platforms like TikTok and YouTube.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from immediately revoking deportation protections and work permits for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who legally entered the U.S. under a Biden-era program. Judge Indira Talwani suspended deportation warnings and prohibited officials from revoking immigration parole without case-by-case reviews, arguing that mass terminations undermine the rule of law. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 500,000 migrants who arrived under the CHNV program, which the Biden administration credited with reducing illegal border crossings, while the Trump administration claims the program was poorly vetted and fueled crime.</p>

The firm argues that the order, which seeks to restrict access to government buildings and cancel contracts, is unconstitutional and retaliatory for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 election. Since Trump began targeting law firms, some have agreed to provide legal services promoting causes supported by the president, while others are fighting the action in federal court.

            <p>Cybersecurity stocks, including CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, have seen strong gains due to recent high-profile cybersecurity incidents. The CNBC Investing Club views cybersecurity as an indispensable part of an investment portfolio, noting its resilience to economic downturns. While the Club has a long-term view on CrowdStrike, it is considering selling some shares to capitalize on the stock's strong rebound and reallocate funds to other undervalued companies. This strategy balances selling winners with scrutinizing losers in the portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Despite the Supreme Court's ruling on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, federal courts still have tools to constrain the Trump administration's policies. A court could order the government to request Abrego Garcia's return, halt payments to El Salvador for his detention, or pursue diplomatic means. The author suggests courts could impose sanctions for non-compliance and ramp up pre-removal judicial review to prevent future cases like Abrego Garcia's. The case is viewed as a critical test for the rule of law during the Trump administration, highlighting the need for courts to hold the executive branch accountable.</p>
