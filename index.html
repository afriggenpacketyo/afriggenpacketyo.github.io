          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Domestic and Foreign Policies Are Guided by Personal Interests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics and political analysts argue that Donald Trump's policy decisions, both domestic and foreign, are consistently driven by his personal self-interest rather than a coherent ideology. This approach was highlighted by his recent consideration of an executive order to eliminate mail-in voting, reportedly after a suggestion from Russian President Vladimir Putin. This pattern of conflating personal grievances with national policy is also seen in his approaches to immigration and trade, creating a vulnerability to manipulation by foreign leaders. This style marks a significant departure from traditional presidential conduct, which typically separates personal politics from international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has overseen the test-firing of two newly developed missile types designed to counter aerial threats like drones and cruise missiles. The launches occurred while the United States and South Korea were conducting their annual "Ulchi Freedom Shield" joint military exercises. North Korea condemned these drills as reckless and destabilizing, claiming they are pushing the Korean Peninsula toward "extreme tension." State media released images of the tests but did not specify their exact location, highlighting the nation's continued military development amid regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have heavily bombed the eastern and northern suburbs of Gaza City, including Zeitoun and Shejaia, as part of an ongoing military operation. The Israeli military stated its goal is to dismantle militant infrastructure and prevent Hamas from re-establishing a presence in the area. This comes as Israel prepares for a planned major offensive on Gaza City, which it describes as Hamas's last stronghold, raising international alarm and causing some residents to flee. Amid the escalating conflict, a global hunger monitor has declared a state of famine in the area, a claim Israel disputes.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that recent high-level talks between Chinese and Indian officials present a strategic opportunity to reset bilateral relations. Following meetings in New Delhi and a planned summit, both nations have shown willingness to re-engage, including discussions to restart direct flights and ease investment restrictions. The article argues that Beijing should view New Delhi as a partner, especially as global uncertainties and US trade policies encourage India to pursue greater strategic autonomy. Overcoming their long-standing rivalry, rooted in border disputes like the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, is crucial for constructive collaboration.</p>

          <p>More than 500 Taiwanese troops participated in the "Northern Strike" military drills in Michigan, marking the largest-ever contingent from Taiwan to join such an exercise. The participation, which was revealed by Pentagon-linked media, signals a deepening of defense ties between Washington and Taipei. This public acknowledgment breaks from the previous policy of ambiguity regarding Taiwan's involvement in American military exercises. The move is seen as a significant development in the strategic relationship between the two, despite the transactional nature of the current US administration's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Multiple bands, including The Last Dinner Party, have withdrawn from the Victorious music festival in Portsmouth in protest. The boycott followed an incident where the Irish folk band The Mary Wallopers had their sound cut off after displaying a Palestinian flag on stage. The festival organizers initially cited a "discriminatory chant" but later apologized to the band, admitting they handled the situation poorly and that the sound was cut after a "Free Palestine" chant. The organizers have pledged to donate to humanitarian relief for Palestinians in response to the controversy over artistic expression and censorship.</p>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning to overhaul sentencing rules to allow courts to impose wider restrictions on offenders serving community sentences.

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the goal is to make community punishments tougher and more restrictive.

          <h2>Estonians Prepare for Potential Russian Aggression Through Civilian Defense Training</h2>

          <p>In Estonia, citizens are actively preparing for the possibility of a Russian invasion by joining voluntary defense organizations like the Naiskodukaitse (Women's Voluntary Defense Organization). Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, membership has grown, with civilians receiving training in first aid, military skills, and safety. Despite the perceived threat, particularly due to Estonia's strategic location, residents express a sense of preparedness rather than fear. This culture of self-defense is bolstered by Estonia's significant investment in its military and its crucial membership in the NATO alliance, which provides collective security.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of French citizens are joining the military reserves, reflecting a growing concern for national and European security, particularly in light of Russia's aggression. France aims to more than double its number of operational reservists to 105,000 by 2035, supported by a sharp increase in military spending under President Emmanuel Macron. This trend is mirrored across Europe, where countries are re-evaluating their defense capabilities and manpower. For many French volunteers, from students to professionals, joining the reserves is a way to serve their country and prepare for a future they see as increasingly uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, has stated that claims of Chinese ownership of American farmland posing a national security threat are "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie noted that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total U.S. farmland. He argued that legislative efforts in some states to restrict such purchases are a form of political manipulation disguised as national security concerns. The ambassador's comments aim to counter growing political rhetoric and reassure the agricultural sector about the nature of Chinese investment in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers lost their final preseason game 30-23 to the San Francisco 49ers in a sloppy contest marked by turnovers and penalties. While the starters rested, several players on the roster bubble had notable performances ahead of the upcoming cuts to a 53-man roster. Undrafted linebacker Marlowe Wax made a strong case for himself with a series of outstanding defensive plays, including a strip-sack. Conversely, other backup players made costly mistakes, leaving the coaching staff with difficult decisions regarding the team's depth for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned President Donald Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as an "abuse of power." Pritzker stated there is no emergency justifying such a deployment and accused the president of trying to "manufacture a crisis." This follows Trump's deployment of troops to Washington D.C. as part of a crackdown on crime in Democrat-run cities. Chicago's mayor also expressed "grave concerns" about the plan, warning that an uncoordinated deployment could escalate tensions between residents and law enforcement in the city.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma mother and stepfather have been charged with felony child neglect after their 11-year-old daughter gave birth to a full-term baby at home without medical assistance. Prosecutors allege that Dustin and Cherie Walker failed to provide medical care or supervision, noting the child had not seen a doctor in over a year and had received no prenatal care. The couple claimed they were unaware of the pregnancy. The case has horrified officials, who anticipate filing additional charges pending paternity test results to identify the baby's father.</p>
