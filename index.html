          <p>Joint military drills between Russia and Belarus, known as Zapad 2025, are causing significant concern among Baltic states like Lithuania. The exercises, which involve tens of thousands of soldiers and advanced weaponry like the new Oreshnik missiles, have heightened fears of potential provocations or border incidents. In response, Lithuania has increased its military budget, enhanced border patrols, and is conducting its own drills with NATO allies. The situation evokes historical anxieties and is seen as a long-term strategic threat, especially given the precedent of Russian military build-ups before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in prison for her role in a federal bribery scheme. She was convicted of accepting bribes, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury vehicle, in exchange for her husband's political influence. During the sentencing, Menendez expressed remorse and claimed her husband had manipulated her, stating she took full accountability for her actions. The judge granted a delayed surrender date of July 2026, citing her ongoing cancer treatments, a sentence substantially below the federal guidelines.</p>

          <p>Following the public assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, this article reflects on the normalization of political violence in the United States. The author expresses concern that what was once unthinkable is now met with a muted public response, highlighting a dangerous erosion of shared human decency. Citing other recent violent acts, the piece argues that desensitization to such events poses a significant threat to democratic society. It calls for a universal condemnation of violence, regardless of the victim's political affiliation, to prevent further societal decay.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose by 2.9% in August compared to the previous year, marking the fastest inflation rate since January. Economists attribute the increase to higher costs for essential goods like food and electricity, as well as the impact of tariffs on items such as apparel and household furniture. While services inflation has stalled, rising prices for groceries and consumer goods are driving the upward trend. This acceleration presents a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which is considering interest rate cuts to support a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After months of ignoring European Union proposals for joint action on China policy, the Trump administration has now engaged, but with a demanding condition. President Trump has asked the EU to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese and Indian purchases of Russian energy, promising a reciprocal U.S. tariff. This move is part of a broader discussion on secondary sanctions to pressure Russia over its war in Ukraine. While EU officials are pleased to have the administration's focus, there is significant doubt within the bloc about the feasibility of implementing such a drastic and economically impactful tariff.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, this article explores how to process grief for a public figure amidst deep political polarization, drawing parallels to Jewish mourning rituals like shiva. The author notes Kirk's personal observance of the Sabbath as a practice of stepping away from public conflict, suggesting it offers a model for finding humanity beyond political battles. The piece argues that mourning his violent death is a communal obligation, necessary to acknowledge the shared threat that political violence poses to society. It advocates for creating space to hold complex feelings without demanding ideological resolution first.</p>

          <h2>Study Warns US Foreign Aid Cuts Could Lead to Millions of Additional Tuberculosis Deaths</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in PLOS Global Public Health projects that the Trump administration's cuts to foreign assistance could have a devastating impact on the global fight against tuberculosis. Researchers estimate that under a worst-case funding scenario, an additional 10 million people could contract TB, leading to 2.2 million more deaths by 2030. The U.S. is the primary funder for TB programs in many high-burden countries, and the abrupt cuts have already stalled diagnostic and treatment efforts. Even a quick restoration of funding would likely result in nearly 100,000 excess deaths due to treatment disruptions.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Medicare's 3-Day Rule for Skilled Nursing Facility Coverage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 11:08:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains Medicare's "3-day rule," a critical regulation that determines coverage for skilled nursing facility (SNF) care. To qualify for Medicare Part A to cover SNF costs, a beneficiary must first have a medically necessary inpatient hospital stay of at least three consecutive days. Time spent in the emergency room or under "observation status" does not count toward this requirement, a distinction that can leave patients with unexpected, substantial bills. While some Medicare Advantage plans may waive this rule, understanding the difference between inpatient admission and observation is crucial for seniors to avoid significant out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

          <p>MSNBC has severed ties with political analyst Matthew Dowd following comments he made on-air shortly after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Dowd suggested that Kirk's history of inflammatory rhetoric contributed to the violent outcome, stating that "hateful thoughts lead to hateful words which then lead to hateful actions." The remarks drew immediate backlash, prompting an apology from MSNBC's president, who called the comments "inappropriate, insensitive, and unacceptable." Dowd later issued his own apology, clarifying that he did not intend to blame Kirk for the attack.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will posthumously award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated at a university event in Utah. During a September 11th remembrance ceremony, Trump praised Kirk as a "giant of his generation" and an inspiration to millions of young people. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation's highest civilian honor, awarded for meritorious contributions to the country. A date for the ceremony has not yet been announced, as the investigation into Kirk's killing continues.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from former Vice President Kamala Harris's forthcoming book has reopened discussions within the Democratic Party about President Joe Biden's decision to run for reelection in 2024. Harris describes the choice as reckless, suggesting it was driven by personal ego rather than the high stakes of the election. The excerpt reveals her belief that some of Biden's staff undermined her and fueled negative narratives. This look back at the campaign, which ended in defeat, has prompted renewed debate among Democrats, with some seeing it as a necessary part of processing the loss and others wishing to move on.</p>

          <p>Over 100 global media organizations, including DW, are urging the Trump administration to abandon a proposal that would drastically shorten the permitted stay for foreign journalists in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security aims to reduce the renewable five-year 'I visa' to a non-renewable 240-day period. Critics argue this would hinder in-depth reporting on American affairs, leaving international audiences less informed and creating a vacuum for disinformation from rival nations. The move is seen as a threat to press freedom that emulates restrictive regimes and undermines America's global standing.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Trump's Response to Kirk Assassination Dangerously Frames Political Violence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques President Trump's speech following Charlie Kirk's assassination, arguing that it dangerously misrepresents the nature of political violence in America. The author contends that by exclusively blaming the "radical left" before a motive was confirmed, Trump defined political violence as a solely left-wing tactic while ignoring right-wing incidents. The analysis points out that Trump's rhetoric expanded the definition of incitement to include comparing political figures to authoritarians, a tactic he himself frequently employs. The piece concludes that the president's response treats the political opposition as accessories to murder, threatening to use government power against them.</p>
