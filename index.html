          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced plans to deploy 50,000 of AMD's Instinct MI450 graphics processors, with the rollout beginning in the second half of 2026. This strategic move signals growing competition for Nvidia, which currently dominates the AI chip market with over 90% market share. The decision highlights a trend among cloud providers to offer AMD's GPUs as a viable alternative, particularly for AI inferencing tasks. This development follows other significant collaborations between AMD and major AI players like OpenAI, underscoring the increasing demand for diverse and powerful computing resources.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent visit to China has aligned with the mainland launch of the new iPhone Air, which will support eSIM technology following regulatory approval. China's three major telecom operators have confirmed they will begin commercial trials for the eSIM function, a key feature that allows for thinner phone designs. The iPhone Air, priced from 7,999 yuan, will be available for pre-order on Friday, with shipments starting next week, about a month later than in other global markets. This development is considered a significant milestone for China's smartphone industry, paving the way for other domestic manufacturers to release eSIM-enabled devices.</p>

          <p>Recent aid cuts from the United States have sparked debate over the decline of Western influence on democratic norms in Africa. Observers note a trend of suppressing political opposition in several East African nations, a situation some analysts believe has been emboldened by the return of Donald Trump to the White House. However, many African activists and scholars argue that the continent should look inward to strengthen its own democratic institutions rather than relying on Western models. The article highlights that while citizens still prefer democracy, they are dissatisfied with its current function, suggesting that grassroots education and regional support are key to fostering sustainable democratic governance.</p>

          <p>As Disney prepares to name a successor to CEO Bob Iger, the board is reportedly considering a co-CEO structure, potentially appointing both Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro. This model has seen success at companies like Netflix, where distinct areas of expertise and a strong executive chairman have facilitated the arrangement. However, corporate governance experts and insiders warn this could be a poor choice for Disney due to its famously political culture and Iger's own history of reluctance to fully cede control. The article suggests that a dual-leadership setup could lead to internal power struggles and a lack of clear authority, echoing the troubled power-sharing dynamic during Bob Chapek's tenure.</p>

These protests have forced governments to make concessions, such as reversing a social media ban in Nepal and scrapping perks for politicians in Timor-Leste. Analysts suggest that while these movements are not aimed at overthrowing governments, they signal a rising demand for systemic accountability from a digitally connected and politically engaged younger generation.</p>

          <p>The Israeli artistic gymnastics team, including defending world champion Artem Dolgopyat, will be unable to compete in the upcoming World Championships after host nation Indonesia refused to grant them entry visas. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, cited the ongoing military offensive in Gaza as the reason for its decision. The Israel Gymnastics Federation's appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for urgent measures to either compel participation or move the event were rejected. The federation condemned the decision as a blatant violation of sporting rules and a blow to the principles of fair competition.</p>

          <p>Officials have publicly identified the 16 individuals who were killed in a powerful explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems plant in rural Tennessee on October 10. The company, which supplies explosives to the military, is a major employer in the tight-knit community, and the blast left no survivors at the site. Among the victims was Trent Stewart, a local church pastor, whose congregation held a prayer service in his honor.

          <p>The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), a political group affiliated with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, has issued a statement dismissing the recent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The organization declared it has "no illusions" that the agreement will protect Palestinian life and called for continued resistance against what it terms Israeli "apartheid and occupation." The statement, which did not mention the release of Israeli hostages, has drawn criticism from political opponents, including former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's own statement on the ceasefire echoed the DSA's language, prompting further backlash for not mentioning Hamas or its actions.</p>

The case follows the original "dieselgate" scandal involving Volkswagen and alleges that other carmakers similarly used software to reduce harmful emissions only under test conditions.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed climate concerns and ordered the removal of climate change references from mission statements, while the 2026 budget proposes a $1.6 billion cut in related spending. This policy shift comes despite evidence that rising heat has sickened over 10,000 troops since 2018 and major storms have caused billions in damages to bases.

          <p>A forthcoming U.S. defense strategy report is expected to introduce significant changes to America's approach to countering China, potentially prioritizing homeland security over direct confrontation in the Indo-Pacific. According to a Pentagon memo, the new strategy will focus on defending U.S. borders and skies while still aiming to deter China. Chinese defense researchers interpret this as a shift towards a broader, indirect containment strategy through peripheral regions rather than a direct military standoff. This change in focus suggests a recalibration of U.S. strategic priorities under the current administration, moving away from the previous emphasis on the Indo-Pacific front lines.</p>

The collapse was attributed to the government's inability to provide evidence officially labeling China a "threat to national security" at the time of the alleged offenses.

The durability of the truce is in question, as Israeli troops remain in Gaza and will not withdraw until Hamas disarms, a condition the group may not accept.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's leading semiconductor association has strongly criticized the Dutch government for taking control of Nexperia, a Netherlands-based chip manufacturer wholly owned by the Chinese company Wingtech. The Dutch government invoked a national security law to assume control, citing "serious governance shortcomings" and concerns about technology transfers. In response, China accused the Netherlands of abusing the concept of national security and imposing discriminatory restrictions on Chinese enterprises. The move caused Wingtech's shares to plummet and highlights the growing geopolitical tensions surrounding the global semiconductor industry and its critical supply chains.</p>

          <p>Former England cricketer Stuart Broad has stirred up the pre-Ashes rivalry by claiming Australia's current team is likely their "worst since 2010," the last time England won a series down under. Responding to a prediction of a 4-0 Australian victory from David Warner, Broad argued that while Australia are favorites at home, they face significant questions regarding their team composition and the fitness of captain Pat Cummins. He suggested that the combination of a weaker Australian side and a strong English squad creates the potential for a highly competitive series. England has struggled in Australia since their 2010-11 triumph, suffering three consecutive heavy series defeats.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs announced a significant 37% jump in quarterly profit, exceeding expectations due to a surge in investment banking fees and strong performance in its asset and wealth management division. The bank's advisory fees grew by 60% as corporations revived merger and acquisition plans, while revenue from asset and wealth management rose 17% to $4.4 billion. The positive results reflect a favorable market for dealmaking and high stock market levels, which have boosted management fees. Trading revenue also remained resilient, with equities trading up 7%, showcasing broad strength across the firm's major business lines. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors will take a $1.6 billion charge in its third-quarter results, reflecting a strategic pullback from its earlier, more aggressive electric vehicle plans. The charge includes $1.2 billion in non-cash adjustments to EV capacity and $400 million in cash for contract cancellation fees. The company attributes the move to a slower-than-expected EV adoption rate, influenced by recent U.S. policy changes such as the termination of some consumer tax credits and less stringent emissions regulations. This decision follows a similar move by Ford and signals a broader industry recalibration as automakers adjust to the current realities of the EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new think tank, the Searchlight Institute, has been launched by veteran Democratic operative Adam Jentleson with the goal of encouraging the party's candidates to adopt more "heterodox" positions outside the traditional liberal consensus. The organization aims to help Democrats win in diverse regions by tailoring their platforms to local views, even if it means breaking with party orthodoxy on certain issues. However, the project has drawn sharp criticism from progressives, who argue it is a billionaire-funded effort to abandon core values and move the party to the right. The debate highlights a deeper, existential struggle within the Democratic Party about its future direction and strategy for winning elections.</p>

          <p>China has implemented sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports, specifically targeting their use by foreign militaries, a move that could severely disrupt the U.S. defense industry. These critical minerals are essential components in advanced U.S. weapons systems, including F-35 fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles. Because China dominates over 90% of the global refining capacity, the new licensing requirements give Beijing powerful leverage in trade negotiations with Washington. The restrictions have reignited trade war fears, prompting the Trump administration to threaten 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and accelerate efforts to develop a domestic rare earth supply chain.

          <p>This year's autumn foliage season is being impacted by significant drought conditions across more than 40% of the United States, particularly in the Northeast and the West. The lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall prematurely, resulting in less vibrant colors and a shorter viewing season for "leaf-peepers." While tourism in areas like New England remains strong, experts note that the colors are not as brilliant as in previous years. The muted display is another visible consequence of changing climate patterns, which stress forest ecosystems with dry weather and heat waves, though ecologists note that the forests still possess a natural resilience.</p>

Additionally, their time while unemployed will not count toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, delaying their path to debt cancellation. The article advises affected borrowers to explore options like income-driven repayment plans, which can lower monthly payments to zero, or an unemployment deferment to temporarily pause payments while they seek new employment.</p>

Rajoelina, who has reportedly fled the country, framed the dissolution as necessary to "restore order" and allow the people to be heard through new elections.

Only about 5% of respondents expressed concern, despite studies suggesting that nearly 40% of jobs in the country involve tasks that could be automated. The survey also indicated a limited understanding of AI among the workforce, with less than 40% of employees having received any formal training on the subject, even in companies where it is already in use. This widespread lack of concern suggests a potential disconnect between public perception and the transformative impact AI is expected to have on the labor market.</p>

Authorities believe the occupants deliberately filled the two-story home with gas, which ignited when the police team opened the front door, causing the structure to collapse instantly. Two siblings in their 60s have been arrested, and investigators are treating the case as premeditated murder, calling it a "barbaric act" against law enforcement.</p>
