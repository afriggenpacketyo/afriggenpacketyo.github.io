          <h2>Los Angeles Mayor Describes Widespread Fear Amid Federal Immigration Raids</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reports that recent immigration raids under the Trump administration have created a climate of fear throughout the city, which has a large immigrant and Latino population. She criticizes the tactics of federal agents, describing them as "masked men in unmarked cars" who detain individuals, including legal residents and citizens, causing community-wide anxiety. The mayor notes that this fear has impacted local economies, with businesses like restaurants seeing fewer patrons. While appreciating past federal help with wildfires, Bass condemns the current immigration actions as punitive and disruptive to the city.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Republican from Tennessee, reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. While advocating for transparency, he emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and innocent individuals who may be named in the files. Burchett pushed back against President Trump's recent criticism of Republicans seeking the documents, stating he was undeterred. He characterized the Attorney General's move to unseal grand jury evidence as "a start" but expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed, noting Washington's tendency to protect its secrets.</p>

          <p>A passenger ferry in Indonesia, the KM Barcelona 5, caught fire while traveling to Manado, resulting in at least five fatalities, including a pregnant woman. Over 280 people were successfully rescued, many by jumping overboard as the fire engulfed the vessel, with local fishermen assisting in the evacuation efforts. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about maritime safety standards in the Southeast Asian archipelago, following another deadly ferry sinking just weeks prior. The cause of the fire, which started at the stern, is under investigation by the country's coast guard and maritime security agency.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly called for the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians to revert to their previous team names, which were changed due to criticism for being insensitive to Native Americans. In a social media post, he claimed that a large number of Native Americans want the names restored to honor their heritage and prestige. Trump argued that times have changed and that there is now significant demand for the reversal. The teams changed their names in recent years amid a national conversation on race, with Washington becoming the Commanders and Cleveland adopting the Guardians moniker.</p>

Fateh, the son of Somali immigrants, has pledged to raise the minimum wage, increase affordable housing, and combat police violence if elected.

          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, announced a significant shift in enforcement policy, stating that agents will arrest any person found to be in the country illegally, regardless of their criminal history. While the agency will still prioritize deporting serious criminal offenders, so-called "collateral" arrests of non-criminals will increase. Lyons attributed this shift to "sanctuary" city policies that prevent ICE from accessing noncitizen inmates in local jails. The agency is also intensifying its crackdown on companies that hire unauthorized workers, promising to hold employers accountable for exploitation.</p>

          <p>This article presents a poem by Jodie Hollander titled "Your Horses," written in tribute to the style of poet Ted Hughes. The poem evokes a powerful image of ten silent, statue-like horses on the moors in the early morning light, described as "megaliths with draped manes." The narrator reflects on whether the subject of the poem, presumably Hughes, ever found such a peaceful place again amidst the fame and scandals of life in London. The piece concludes with the haunting question of whether the subject is still searching the barren moors for that sense of tranquility.</p>

          <p>During a concert in Wisconsin, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned the audience to prepare themselves before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where cameras feature crowd members on large screens. This warning follows a recent viral incident where a man and woman, later identified as tech CEO Andy Byron and his chief people officer, were shown cuddling and quickly separated in embarrassment. The public exposure led to an internal investigation at their company, Astronomer, and resulted in Byron's resignation. Martin's lighthearted comment appears to be a direct acknowledgment of the fallout from the previous show's unexpected moment.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, despite exit polls projecting that his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was marked by public frustration over rising prices and potential U.S. trade tariffs. This expected defeat would further weaken the coalition's influence, as it already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Analysts suggest the result reflects voter dissatisfaction with Ishiba's leadership and could lead to a leadership challenge within his Liberal Democratic Party, potentially destabilizing the government during critical trade negotiations.</p>

Companies like IBM and Klarna have been more transparent about replacing roles with AI, but most are strategically vague to avoid backlash from employees and the public.

          <p>A man has been arrested after driving a car into a crowd of people waiting outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 individuals, with at least five reported to be in critical condition. The driver, identified as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, struck the crowd, a taco truck, and a valet stand before witnesses pulled him from the vehicle. During the ensuing struggle, Ramirez was shot before he fled the scene on foot; he is now in custody and faces potential attempted murder charges. Paramedics discovered that one of the injured victims also had a gunshot wound, and the police investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for Finding 'Neutral Ground' in a Divided Nation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, suggests that in an era of deep political division, finding "neutral ground" is more crucial than searching for elusive "common ground." Drawing from his experience learning to surf with his brother-in-law, who holds vastly different political views, Litt argues for the importance of shared activities that allow people to connect beyond their disagreements. He believes these neutral spaces can foster friendships and lead to more genuine discussions on contentious issues. This approach, he contends, is essential for navigating a world where nearly everything has become politicized.</p>

          <p>A performer at London's Royal Opera House unfurled a large Palestinian flag during the curtain call for the closing night of the opera 'Il trovatore'. Video of the incident shows a brief struggle as a stage official unsuccessfully attempted to take the flag from the cast member, who held onto it for the remainder of the curtain call. The Royal Ballet and Opera issued a statement calling the protest a "spontaneous and unauthorised action" and inappropriate for a curtain call, emphasizing its commitment to political impartiality. The protest was met with a mixed reaction from the audience, with some booing and others cheering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and his office have adopted a more combative and aggressive social media strategy to counter President Trump and his allies, departing from traditional Democratic decorum. This shift includes using memes and sharp, sometimes coarse language, such as calling a White House official a "fascist cuck." Newsom defends the new approach as necessary to fight back against what he calls the cruelty and misinformation of the Trump administration, particularly after federal troops were deployed to Los Angeles for immigration enforcement. This change in tone has significantly boosted his social media engagement, though it risks alienating voters who prefer more respectful political discourse.</p>

          <p>A series of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia prompted the temporary closure of Moscow's major airports, leading to the cancellation of over 140 flights and the redirection of more than 130 others. Russia's defense ministry reported downing over 230 drones across the country since Saturday, with 27 intercepted over the capital region alone. The attacks also affected the Kaluga region and areas near the Ukrainian border. This disruption to Russian air travel comes as the Kremlin's spokesman reiterated President Putin's readiness for a peace settlement, while Ukraine's president proposed a new round of talks to end the war.</p>

          <p>An infectious disease physician and researcher has systematically refuted several claims about vaccine safety made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The article corrects Kennedy's assertions, stating that the childhood vaccine schedule involves around 50 injections, not 92, and that the biological load (antigens) is 95% lower than in 1986. Contrary to Kennedy's claims, numerous routine childhood vaccines were tested against inert placebos, and extensive post-market surveillance systems continuously monitor safety. The author also debunks the claim of widespread financial conflicts of interest among federal vaccine advisors, citing it as a misrepresentation of a government audit.</p>

          <p>This article profiles actress and cabaret star Bridget Everett, focusing on her journey from her small-town Kansas roots to starring in the HBO series "Somebody Somewhere." The semi-autobiographical show, set in her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, explores themes of friendship, grief, and self-discovery. Everett discusses how her famously risqué live performances are a way for her to connect with people and process her own life experiences, including family loss. The show, which recently concluded, was praised for its authentic portrayal of finding hope amid hopelessness and earned both a Peabody Award and an Emmy nomination.</p>

A meeting could occur either on the sidelines of the summit or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. While Xi is expected to attend, Trump's participation has not been confirmed. This speculation follows recent diplomatic engagements between the two nations, including a meeting between their top diplomats and a phone call where the leaders extended mutual invitations for state visits.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Olga Khazan's book, "Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change," chronicles her attempt to become more extroverted by enrolling in an improv comedy class. As a self-described introvert with "high loneliness," Khazan forces herself out of her comfort zone to tackle her social anxiety head-on, despite her dislike for improv as an art form. She describes the initial awkwardness of warm-up games like "Zip Zap Zop" and the surreal experience of pretending to juggle invisible objects with strangers. The experience is framed as a form of "rehab for perfectionists," where making mistakes is encouraged.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that traditional metrics for the U.S. labor market, such as the unemployment rate and jobs reports, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. The author contends that with the rise of the "over-employed," remote work, side gigs, and the gig economy, simply counting "jobs" is no longer a relevant measure of economic health. Instead, the focus should shift to measuring income from all sources, adjusted for inflation, to get a more accurate picture of Americans' financial well-being. The article calls for a new system that uses real-time data from tax returns and private sources rather than relying on outdated government surveys.</p>

          <p>The small desert town of Newberry Springs, California, located on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a resurgence as the famous highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s, a fate shared by many communities along the route. Now, local residents and business owners are banding together to prepare for an anticipated influx of tourists, planning new events, tours, and attractions. They aim to capitalize on the centennial celebration to revitalize their community while preserving its unique, "frozen in time" rural character.</p>

Singh, who gained international fame for completing marathons after the age of 89, was struck by an SUV while walking near his fields. His death has drawn tributes from around the world but also casts a spotlight on India's notoriously dangerous roads, where over 150,000 people are killed annually. A 26-year-old man has been arrested for the incident, but experts argue that poor road engineering and a lack of pedestrian infrastructure are major contributing factors to the country's high rate of traffic fatalities.</p>

Many now place more hope in the U.S. administration to pressure Israel into a deal. This sentiment reflects a deep-seated fear that far-right elements in the coalition government value land and political goals over human life, challenging the long-held Israeli ethos that no one is left behind.</p>
