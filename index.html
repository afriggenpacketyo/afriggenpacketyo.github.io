          <p>U.S. federal authorities, led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), detained 475 individuals in a major immigration enforcement operation at a Hyundai construction site in Georgia. The raid, described as the largest single-site operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, was part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices. Most of those detained were reportedly Korean nationals, prompting a response from South Korea's Foreign Ministry urging protection for its citizens' rights. The operation has drawn criticism from labor groups who call it a politically motivated act that creates an atmosphere of fear among immigrant workers.</p>

          <p>English pace bowler Matthew Potts is back in consideration for the prestigious Ashes tour after being released from the T20 squad for an upcoming series against Ireland. This move allows him to play in the County Championship, providing a crucial opportunity to demonstrate his red-ball cricket form ahead of the Ashes squad selection. The decision comes as England faces a potential opening in its pace bowling lineup due to another player's retirement from the format and injury concerns for a senior bowler. Potts, who holds a central contract, now has a clear chance to reclaim his spot in the Test team under coach Brendon McCullum.</p>

          <p>Former Biden spokesman Andrew Bates faced sharp criticism from House Oversight Committee Republicans after he used his opening statement to attack former President Trump and the GOP's investigative priorities. The committee is probing whether former President Biden's aides covered up signs of cognitive decline, including the potential misuse of an autopen for official signatures. A committee spokesperson called Bates's statement "delusional" and part of a "cognitive decline cover-up." In his remarks, Bates defended Biden's leadership and accused Republicans of ignoring corruption under Trump while investigating an honorable public servant, escalating the partisan conflict surrounding the investigation.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.8 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing after no winning tickets were sold for the previous $1.4 billion prize. This new amount ranks as the second-largest jackpot in the history of U.S. lotteries, with a potential cash value of approximately $826.4 million before taxes. The current run has now reached 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, tying the game's record. This streak has generated significant public interest and ticket sales across the 45 states where Powerball is played, as hopeful participants vie for the historic prize.</p>

          <p>The investment platform Yieldstreet has notified customers that they are unlikely to recover any funds from a series of defaulted marine loans totaling $89 million. The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, but stated that its own legal and recovery costs exceeded this amount, leaving nothing for investors. The ill-fated deals, which involved loans for ship-breaking operations, soured after Yieldstreet lost track of the vessels used as collateral, leading to a high-profile lawsuit and accusations of fraud.

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her roles as UK deputy prime minister, housing secretary, and deputy Labour leader after it was determined she had underpaid taxes on a property sale. An investigation by the prime minister's ethics adviser concluded that while she acted with integrity, she had breached the ministerial code by failing to seek expert tax advice. Rayner admitted to not meeting the highest standards and took full responsibility for the error, which involved an additional £40,000 in stamp duty on a flat she purchased. Her departure has triggered a major cabinet reshuffle and a pending election for a new deputy Labour leader.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations for their role in asking the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza. The U.S. Treasury Department listed Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights for engaging with the ICC's efforts to prosecute Israeli nationals without Israel's consent. The groups, which have documented alleged atrocities for years, condemned the sanctions as immoral and illegal.

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot climbs to a historic $1.8 billion, an analysis of tax laws reveals significant disparities in take-home winnings depending on the winner's state. While all winners face a federal tax withholding of 24% plus additional federal taxes, some states impose their own income tax on lottery prizes, which can exceed 10%. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep a larger portion of their prize. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York and New Jersey, would result in the lowest after-tax payouts for the jackpot winner.</p>

          <p>The United States is sending ten F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico to support operations targeting drug cartels in the Caribbean, according to a source familiar with the plan. This deployment comes amid rising tensions with Venezuela over the drug trade, highlighted by a recent deadly U.S. strike on a boat carrying suspected traffickers. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use military assets to combat the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. The presence of these advanced fighter jets signals a significant escalation in the resources being dedicated to counter-narcotics missions in the region.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Sweden are reporting an alarming trend of teenage girls being recruited as contract killers by organized crime networks, often through encrypted messaging apps. Authorities say the girls are sometimes keen to prove they can be more ruthless than their male counterparts to secure roles within the gangs. This development highlights a previously overlooked aspect of Sweden's escalating gang violence, which has become a systemic threat involving drug trafficking and frequent shootings. Experts note that these young women are often highly vulnerable, with many having histories of drug addiction and trauma, making them susceptible to exploitation by criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Following a surprisingly weak August jobs report, economists are describing the U.S. labor market as having gone "off a cliff-edge," creating a challenging environment for job seekers. With job openings now outnumbered by unemployed individuals for the first time since 2021, competition for available positions has intensified significantly. Career coaches advise job seekers to focus on networking, keeping their skills current, and potentially broadening their search to more resilient sectors like healthcare. They also emphasize the importance of patience and persistence, suggesting that leveraging professional platforms and seeking internal opportunities can be crucial strategies in the current frozen job market.

          <p>Comedy writer Graham Linehan, co-creator of "Father Ted," told a London court that his life has been made "hell" by transgender activists during his trial for harassment and criminal damage. Linehan is accused of relentlessly posting abusive comments about a transgender activist, Sophia Brooks, on social media and then throwing her phone into a road during a confrontation. He pleaded not guilty, arguing that he is being targeted and punished for his views on gender identity. Linehan claimed that he felt the complainant was able to get away with harassment because police believe activists at their every word, framing the trial as part of a larger campaign against him.</p>

          <p>A contributor for the Los Angeles Times argues that President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to high-crime cities is a politically savvy move that aligns with public sentiment. The opinion piece asserts that despite liberal criticism of the plan as authoritarian, many Americans, particularly residents of affected communities, are desperate for effective solutions to persistent violent crime. The author contends that Trump is adept at forcing his opponents to defend unpopular positions, such as lenient crime policies, while he champions a message of law and order. The article frames the proposal not as an overreach but as a necessary federal intervention where local governance has failed.</p>

The report, which showed the addition of only 22,000 jobs, is seen as the final piece of evidence needed to justify monetary easing at the Fed's next meeting. This development has locked in market expectations for a rate cut, shifting the focus to the central bank's future policy path for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Operational milestones include delivering millions of vehicles and AI-powered robots, which Musk believes could make Tesla the world's most valuable company.
