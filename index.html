            <h2>China Faces Deflationary Pressures Amid Trade War Escalation</h2>

            <p>China's consumer prices declined for the second consecutive month, while producer price deflation worsened, signaling rising deflationary pressures as the trade war with the U.S. intensifies. The consumer price index fell by 0.1% year-on-year in March, and producer prices dropped 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Despite these challenges, core inflation rebounded slightly, and the Chinese government is reportedly preparing further stimulus measures focused on boosting domestic consumption to offset the impact of rising tariffs. Chinese exporters are bracing for more pain amid an escalating trade war with the U.S.</p>

            <p>Despite expectations of economic hardship due to the intensifying tariff war between Washington and Beijing, many Chinese citizens are expressing support for their government's retaliatory measures. The new tariffs imposed by the U.S., raised to 125%, have ignited ire across China, with many voicing defiance and determination to withstand the economic pressure. Beijing has responded with 84% tariffs on all U.S. products and reiterated its commitment to fighting "to the end," while emphasizing the need for dialogues based on equality and respect. This unified stance contrasts with the divisions seen during the previous trade war, indicating a strengthened resolve to face the challenges ahead.</p>

            <p>A New York jury awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years. The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims. The verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals "who don't treat women appropriately."</p>

            <p>A chaotic series of events unfolded in Eagle Rock after a homeowner, Jillian Shriner, allegedly shot at a group of people fleeing the scene of a collision and then pointed a handgun at responding police officers.

Shriner, identified as an author and the wife of Weezer's bassist, was shot in the shoulder by police after refusing to drop her weapon. She was absentee-booked on suspicion of attempted murder, while one of the hit-and-run suspects was also apprehended.</p>

            <p>Two couples who were married in a joint ceremony in 1955 have celebrated their 70th wedding anniversaries, attributing their marital success to spending plenty of time apart. Tommy Budge and Thelma Bruce, along with Tommy's sister Violet Budge and Leslie Flett, all from Kirkwall, Orkney, shared a wedding ceremony due to Tommy's impending national service. Both couples spent long periods apart due to work commitments, which they humorously suggest contributed to their long-lasting marriages. They celebrated their Platinum anniversary with family and received a card from King Charles and Queen Camilla.</p>

            <p>Molly Harbron, a 26-year-old woman from Batley, West Yorkshire, has been awarded a multimillion-pound compensation deal after having her leg amputated due to hospital failings. Medics at Dewsbury Hospital failed to properly assess her case, leading to a delay in surgery that resulted in the loss of her left leg in April 2020. The Mid Yorkshire NHS Trust admitted that mistakes caused the delay and confessed that earlier surgery may have saved her leg. The compensation has enabled her to move to a bungalow and obtain a prosthetic leg, restoring her independence.</p>

            <p>Broadcaster and former England striker Eni Aluko has expressed hope that her victory in the first stage of a High Court libel claim against ex-footballer Joey Barton will encourage people to think twice about online speech. Aluko, targeted on social media by Barton, emphasized that she should not face attacks on her race and gender when appearing on TV. The judge ruled Barton's comments, suggesting Aluko's late father was financially corrupt and accusing her of "playing the race card," were defamatory. Aluko hopes this will lead to more people speaking out against online abuse.</p>

            <p>Local elections in England, while often lacking the national excitement of a general election, are crucial for determining the management and funding of local services. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors across 23 local authorities, as well as several local authority and combined authority mayors. These elections serve as a barometer of national sentiment and provide an opportunity for voters to address concerns about local roads, social care, and council tax value. The results are also closely watched for their potential impact on national political dynamics, as demonstrated by past local election outcomes.</p>

            <p>While Donald Trump has partially rolled back his proposed tariff increases, the global economy, including the UK, still faces significant risks. Despite the reduction in tariffs for most countries, China faces increased levies, and the remaining tariffs threaten to disrupt global finance and trade. Potential consequences include reduced global growth, rising inflation, delayed stock market listings, and increased risks in junk bond markets. The UK is expected to experience a modest reduction in GDP, but the tariffs pose a headache for the government amid already high borrowing costs and fragile consumer confidence.

Brown emphasized the need for collective action, drawing from lessons learned during the 2008 financial crisis, and warned of a potential collapse in consumer confidence and declining business investment.

            <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations does not signal a shift in his overall objectives, and that the world's two largest economies remain locked in a dangerous, intensifying trade war. Tariffs on imports from China were raised to 125 per cent following a retaliatory increase in tariffs from Beijing. This situation could lead to significant disruptions in global supply chains, causing pain not only to China and the US, but to other countries as well. The current tariffs on Chinese products could provide tax revenue of US$835 billion, but that figure would drop to zero if China simply stops exporting.</p>

            <p>Thursday's newspaper front pages primarily focus on Donald Trump's decision to pause tariffs on most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

            <p>Germany is poised to inaugurate a new government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, but it immediately faces daunting challenges including an unstable United States, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and escalating trade tensions with China. Domestically, the German economy is faltering, compounded by US tariffs. The new government must navigate these crises while addressing the rise of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. Despite these challenges, there is optimism that the coalition can work effectively to address the pressing issues facing the nation and Europe.</p>

            <p>Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, alleged to be a top leader of the MS-13 gang, is requesting a delay in the dismissal of his criminal case, despite the Justice Department's motion to end the case in favor of deportation. Santos fears immediate deportation to El Salvador's CECOT prison without due process. He was arrested in Virginia on March 27, and authorities claim he is in the U.S. illegally. His attorney argues that he should be allowed time to seek assistance from immigration counsel due to the risk of unlawful deportation.</p>

            <p>As Beijing and Washington engage in an escalating tariff war, observers suggest that diplomatic backchannels may be crucial for facilitating negotiations. The announcement of another tariff hike on Chinese imports by the US, even as tariffs on most other countries were paused, has deepened the rift between the two largest economies. However, President Trump has indicated that he does not expect to raise levies on Chinese goods any higher, suggesting a potential willingness to negotiate. This situation highlights the importance of exploring alternative diplomatic avenues to de-escalate tensions.</p>

Taylor, who wrote an anonymous New York Times op-ed and a tell-all book critical of Trump, is accused of "treason" by the former president. Krebs, who served as Trump's election security director, was fired for correcting claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.
