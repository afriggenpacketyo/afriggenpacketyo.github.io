          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's order, permitting federal immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to resume stops based on broad criteria. The 6-3 decision allows agents to consider factors like race, language, and occupation when conducting stops, while a legal challenge proceeds. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a strong dissent, arguing the ruling subjects many people to indignities based on their appearance and work. The decision is a significant development in the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>France's government has collapsed after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote, forcing President Emmanuel Macron to find a new prime minister. The vote was a significant political miscalculation by Bayrou, who had called it in an attempt to push through unpopular public spending cuts. This development introduces renewed political uncertainty for France as it contends with major domestic budget issues and international crises. The government's resignation is now constitutionally required after less than nine months in office.</p>

          <p>Paramount has named Kenneth R. Weinstein, the former president of the conservative Hudson Institute, as the new ombudsman for CBS News. This appointment fulfills a condition set by the Trump administration for the approval of Skydance Media's acquisition of Paramount. Weinstein will handle complaints about news coverage and report to top executives, a move intended to ensure "viewpoint diversity" as stipulated by the FCC. The decision follows recent policy changes at CBS News, such as no longer editing taped interviews on "Face the Nation."</p>

          <p>The Chicago suburb of Evanston has issued a warning to its residents about the potential for increased activity from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The alert follows threats from President Trump to deploy federal forces to Chicago to address what he terms a "national crime emergency." In response, Evanston's mayor affirmed the city's status as a welcoming community for immigrants and urged residents to know their rights. This development comes as the Department of Homeland Security announced a targeted enforcement operation in the region.</p>

          <p>Jury selection has commenced in the trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his golf course. Routh, who is representing himself, was admonished by Judge Aileen Cannon for proposing irrelevant and "politically charged" questions for potential jurors. He faces multiple criminal charges, including attempting to kill a presidential candidate, and could be sentenced to life in prison. The trial is expected to last a month, with prosecutors planning to present evidence of Routh's months-long planning and his own written confessions.</p>

          <p>Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, is performing again after a 2022 tongue cancer diagnosis forced him to halt his career. Surgeons removed most of his tongue and reconstructed it with tissue from his thigh, requiring him to relearn how to speak and sing. A year after his surgery and now with no evidence of the disease, Blevins has returned to the stage and launched a nonprofit called "The Tough Crowd Project." The organization aims to provide financial support to other families who are dealing with cancer.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years ago, florist Enver Simsek became the first of ten victims murdered by the German neo-Nazi terrorist group, the National Socialist Underground (NSU). For over a decade, his family was wrongly suspected by investigators before the group's existence was revealed in 2011. Simsek's daughter, Semiya, has become a prominent voice for the victims, highlighting the family's suffering and the institutional failures of the police. The anniversary serves as a painful reminder of the group's racist terror campaign and the lingering questions about how it operated undetected for so long.</p>

          <p>Amid a cooling U.S. job market, financial experts are offering guidance for individuals with student loans who have been laid off or are unemployed. Federal borrowers may be eligible for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can lower monthly payments, sometimes to zero, based on current income including unemployment benefits. Other options include an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments, although interest may still accrue on some loans.

Thune argued the move is necessary due to an "unprecedented blockade" by Democrats, who have blocked nearly all of Trump's nominees from quick confirmation.

While U.S. adults overall still prefer capitalism, its popularity has declined, particularly among younger Democrats. The results highlight the deep internal divisions over economic ideology and political branding within the Democratic party as it navigates its future direction.</p>
