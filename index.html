          <h2>Tesla's Troubles Worsen as Musk's Feud with Trump Impacts Company Value</h2>

          <p>Tesla faces significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, compounded by CEO Elon Musk's public falling out with President Donald Trump. The dispute, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a social media battle and a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value, erasing billions in market capitalization. This rift threatens Tesla's relationship with the administration, potentially affecting regulations, investigations, and government support, and the company was already struggling with declining revenue and increased competition from Chinese EV makers. Tesla investors and public officials are now calling for action from the company's board to ensure Tesla's stability and future, as Musk's polarizing behavior continues to damage the brand. Quality control issues with the Cybertruck are adding to the company's woes, even as Musk promotes autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots as the future. The article explores the business, political, and social factors influencing Tesla's current situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After the removal of four hydroelectric dams, the Klamath River is experiencing a rebirth, revealing 45 miles of previously submerged river between the Keno and Iron Gate dams. This restoration marks the end of a decades-long campaign led by Indigenous tribes, environmental groups, and fishing advocates, aiming to revitalize the river's ecology and cultural significance. As the river reclaims its natural course, new recreational opportunities like rafting and hiking are emerging, with five public recreation sites planned for completion by August 1. The Shasta Indian Nation, which lost ancestral lands to the dams, will regain over 2,800 acres, fostering a renewed connection to their heritage and stewardship of the land. The recovery of the Klamath serves as a hopeful example of how diverse interests can align to enact positive change, even amidst climate challenges. The article details the efforts to restore the river's ecosystem and the cultural revitalization for the Indigenous people. This is a story of ecological recovery and cultural reconnection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a House oversight subcommittee hearing, Power the Future CEO Dan Turner defended his past social media post criticizing Social Security as a "government-sponsored Ponzi scheme" after Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia questioned his credibility. Turner argued that Social Security fits the definition of a Ponzi scheme, requiring more people at the bottom to pay into the system to fund those at the top, and he expressed concern about the system's sustainability given demographic shifts. He suggested that Garcia's focus should be on saving Social Security rather than scrutinizing his social media activity, and Turner argued that the government's handling of Social Security resembles a money-laundering operation for political gain. This exchange highlights the ongoing debate about the future of Social Security and potential reforms.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced the recovery of the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai farmworker who had been taken hostage and killed by a small militant group in Gaza. The recovery operation took place in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, and Pinta had been working as an agricultural laborer in southern Israel when he was kidnapped. This recovery comes after the Israeli army recovered the bodies of two Israeli Americans in Gaza earlier this week. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group urged the Israeli government to reach an agreement with Hamas to free the remaining captives.

          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group announced its departure from Mali after more than three and a half years of combating Islamic extremists, but Russia's state-controlled paramilitary force, Africa Corps, will maintain a presence in the country. Wagner claimed to have brought regional capitals under Malian army control and eliminated armed militants, but the Malian army and Russian mercenaries have faced accusations of targeting civilians. The shift reflects Russia's broader strategy in Africa, replacing Wagner with Africa Corps under the direct command of the Russian defense ministry. This transition may lead to a change in focus from direct combat to training and protection services, with the Africa Corps adopting a lighter footprint than the Wagner mercenaries.</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves aims to present a politically credible review by allocating substantial funds to long-term projects and favored departments like the NHS. However, internal disputes persist, particularly regarding the Home Office's budget, and the review's success hinges on convincing the public that these investments will improve public services and the economy. Despite the overall increase, short-term spending will remain tight, and the government faces pressure to demonstrate tangible results amid concerns about high taxes and debt levels.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Operation Spider's Web, involving undetected drone attacks on Russian airbases, holds important lessons for China regarding modern warfare and potential conflicts in the Taiwan Strait. Ukraine smuggled drones into Russia and used unwitting drivers to transport them, launching them remotely to destroy surveillance planes and bombers. This innovative approach demonstrated that seemingly secure locations are vulnerable in the era of drone technology and asymmetric warfare, serving as a "wake-up moment" for militaries worldwide. China needs to guard against similar infiltration tactics targeting military bases, highlighting the importance of adapting defense strategies to counter evolving threats.</p>

          <p>After interviewing parents of highly successful children, the author identifies five key strategies they employed, including fostering optimism and tailoring motivational approaches to each child's interests. Encouraging a love of learning and recognizing that learning can happen anywhere are also crucial, and the parents emphasized love and support over being coaches or critics. A study showed that parents often underestimate how capable their children are, and how much they will learn from trying hard even in everyday tasks. These lessons highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment that nurtures a child's natural curiosity and drive.</p>
