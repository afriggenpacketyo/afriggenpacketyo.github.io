        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which came shortly before Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a lawsuit against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying National Guard troops to address protests over these enforcement actions. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Trump's federalization of the California National Guard without Newsom's consent, arguing it violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds federal authority. Newsom responded to Trump's comments, accusing him of authoritarianism, while federal prosecutors charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy for impeding an officer during a protest. Optimism surrounding the political climate and the rule of law in America is relatively low, given the escalation of rhetoric and legal challenges. </p>

          <p>Talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw accompanied Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during controversial raids in Los Angeles, his TV network confirmed. This marks the second time this year McGraw has embedded with ICE, previously joining Tom Homan, the US border czar, for a similar event in Chicago. McGraw's network stated that he was present to gain a firsthand perspective on the targeted operations, although he did not directly participate in the raids to avoid escalating tensions. McGraw has increasingly involved himself in political issues, particularly immigration, and has expressed support for Donald Trump. The event reflects a contentious political environment surrounding immigration enforcement. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global transition to clean energy is driving increased demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, which are essential for producing batteries, solar panels, and electric motors. While these minerals are not necessarily rare, their supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions, and their extraction can have significant environmental impacts. The United States is heavily reliant on imports of critical minerals, particularly from China, prompting efforts to increase domestic production and explore alternative materials. Innovation in battery technology and mining practices, along with recycling efforts, may help alleviate some of the constraints on critical mineral supplies in the future. </p>

          <p>California's Democratic leaders announced the state will sue the Trump administration over its decision to activate National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles County. Attorney General Rob Bonta asserted that President Trump abused his authority by invoking Title 10, which allows the president to mobilize the National Guard in cases of invasion or rebellion. Bonta argued that there was no such situation in California and accused Trump of manufacturing chaos for political gain. The lawsuit underscores the ongoing tensions between the state and the federal government over immigration enforcement and the use of military force. </p>

Guterres cautioned against allowing the ocean floor to become a "wild west" due to deep-sea mining, while French President Emmanuel Macron advocated for a moratorium on the practice. The conference also highlighted the need for increased investment in ocean health and the disproportionate impact of ocean degradation on small island nations. </p>

Maximus, however, denies the accusations and asserts that it delivers on policies enacted by both political parties.

          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize the California National Guard to address protests against federal immigration authorities is raising concerns about the use of the military against demonstrators. Legal experts argue that the protests do not meet the conditions for federalizing the National Guard under existing statutes. The action is seen as a chilling signal about the administration's willingness to use military force in domestic situations. The broad powers granted to the president under the Insurrection Act are also being scrutinized. </p>
