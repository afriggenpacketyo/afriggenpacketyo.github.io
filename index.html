        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has been identified as the most economically damaging in UK history, costing the economy an estimated £1.9 billion. The incident forced the shutdown of multiple production facilities for weeks, halting the manufacturing of about 1,000 vehicles per day and affecting over 5,000 organizations in the supply chain. A report from the Cyber Monitoring Centre highlighted that the majority of the financial impact stemmed from lost manufacturing output, not data theft. The study urges businesses to focus more on protecting operational technology to prevent such widespread real-world disruptions in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military has conducted its eighth strike on a suspected drug trafficking vessel since early September, with the latest incident occurring in the Pacific Ocean and resulting in two to three fatalities. This action follows seven previous strikes in the Caribbean, raising questions among some lawmakers, like Senator Mark Kelly, about the legal and constitutional basis for these operations. The administration has justified the strikes by classifying the conflict with drug cartels as a "non-international armed conflict," citing the high number of American deaths from smuggled narcotics. At least 34 individuals have been killed in total across these recent military actions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Beyond Meat saw a dramatic surge followed by a sharp decline, highlighting extreme volatility driven by retail investors. The stock's rally was initially triggered by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and news of expanded distribution at Walmart, leading to a potential short squeeze. However, the gains were quickly pared back, reflecting the unstable nature of meme stock trading reminiscent of the pandemic era. The company's stock has been under long-term pressure, and this recent activity is seen by some market watchers as a sign of market frothiness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 12:30:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has decided to pause the hiring of new job candidates who require H-1B visas, a direct response to the Trump administration's policy of increasing application fees to $100,000. The H-1B program allows U.S. companies to temporarily employ skilled foreign workers, particularly in technology and engineering roles. The administration's stated goal for the fee hike is to protect American jobs and deter companies from hiring foreign workers over domestic ones. While Walmart is the nation's largest private employer, the decision primarily affects a small portion of its corporate workforce, as the company holds nearly 2,400 H-1B visas.</p>

          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old chess prodigy from London, has achieved another significant milestone by defeating former women's world champion and grandmaster Mariya Muzychuk. The victory occurred during the first round of the European Chess Club Cup in Greece, with experts describing her performance as a "near-perfect game." This accomplishment follows her historic win over a 60-year-old grandmaster during the summer, which made her the youngest female player to achieve such a feat. Sivanandan, who only began playing chess during the pandemic at age five, continues to gain international recognition for her exceptional talent.</p>

The two longest shutdowns have both occurred during President Donald Trump's time in office.

England had set a total of 244-9, with Tammy Beaumont top-scoring with 78, but their middle order struggled against Australia's disciplined bowling.

          <p>The recent trend of major technology companies acquiring or heavily investing in AI startups is often resulting in significant layoffs at the smaller firms, challenging the traditional narrative of a lucrative exit for employees. Deals involving companies like Scale AI, Snorkel AI, and Cognition have been followed by workforce reductions as the acquiring giants move to quickly eliminate redundant roles and streamline operations. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift where big tech is prioritizing efficiency and minimum viable staffing over preserving the startup's culture. This trend creates job volatility for startup workers and may change how AI startups recruit.</p>

Leaders at companies like Ford, JPMorgan, and Salesforce have publicly stated that AI will automate many tasks, potentially displacing a substantial number of jobs in fields such as customer support, coding, and marketing. While some data suggests the current impact is minimal and concentrated, reports from Goldman Sachs and the Stanford Digital Economy Lab indicate a decline in entry-level hiring for AI-exposed roles.

This article positions the novel as a response to the gloomy outlook on relationships between men and women, arguing that it emphasizes the specific, real, and personal aspects of intimacy over broad sociopolitical generalizations.

          <p>Charter Communications, which operates Spectrum cable and internet services, is laying off 1,200 employees nationwide in a move to streamline its management functions. The cuts, affecting just over 1% of its workforce, target corporate and management roles rather than sales or service positions. This restructuring comes as the company faces increasing competition and has reported a loss of 177,000 internet subscribers in the first half of the year. The company, which has nearly 30 million internet customers, is also in the process of a planned takeover of Cox Communications, though the layoffs are reportedly unrelated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump is accelerating an "epistemic collapse" by legitimizing AI-generated deepfakes as a tool for political communication. By sharing doctored videos and AI images, such as a fake clip of Senator Chuck Schumer, he cultivates a sense of distrust where any evidence can be dismissed as manipulated. This tactic exploits the public's instinct to believe what they see while simultaneously providing a justification to reject any inconvenient visual proof. The author warns that this, combined with efforts to install loyalists in data-producing government agencies, threatens the institutional underpinnings of a shared, fact-based reality.</p>

He began Tuesday evening, criticizing actions such as deportation efforts, the potential deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland, and what he termed the "weaponization" of the Justice Department. Merkley described the moment as the "biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War," asserting that President Trump is "shredding our Constitution."

The operation was carried out by the PNS Yarmook, a vessel participating in the 47-nation Combined Maritime Forces, which patrols key shipping lanes to disrupt illegal smuggling.

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has formally requested that the Trump administration pause the demolition of the White House's East Wing, which is being cleared for the construction of a new grand ballroom.

The group is urging a halt to the work until the plans undergo legally required public review processes, including consultations with federal planning commissions.

The accusations are amplified by a planned visit to Moscow by a senior AfD federal lawmaker.

          <p>A detailed timeline reveals that thieves spent less than four minutes inside the Louvre museum during a weekend heist, stealing an estimated $102 million worth of crown jewels. The perpetrators used a stolen basket lift to access a balcony, forced a window, and smashed display cases in the Apollo gallery before fleeing on scooters. The entire operation, from parking the lift truck to escaping, took less than eight minutes. While one major piece, the imperial crown of Empress Eugénie, was later found abandoned outside, the thieves escaped with eight other historically invaluable objects.
