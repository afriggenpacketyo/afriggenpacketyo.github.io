          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have legally challenged the Trump administration's decision to deploy the Texas National Guard to Chicago. State and city leaders condemned the move as an unconstitutional and dangerous "power grab" intended to militarize American cities for political purposes. The lawsuit was filed as the guard members were reportedly en route, with officials arguing the action is a maneuver to create chaos and a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in the UK has announced it will appeal a judge's decision to dismiss a terrorism-related case against Liam Og Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap. The charge, which stemmed from allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a 2024 concert, was thrown out due to a technical error regarding the timing of prosecutorial consent. The CPS stated its intent to appeal, believing an important point of law needs clarification regarding the procedural requirements for such cases.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season.

While no coastal watches are in effect, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate it may approach the northern Leeward Islands by Thursday or Friday, generating life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>

          <p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) provides significant rights to consumers facing third-party debt collectors, ensuring they are treated fairly and without harassment. Key protections include the right to demand verification of the debt, which forces collectors to pause efforts until they provide proof. Borrowers also have the right to control how and when they are contacted, and can legally demand that collectors cease communication altogether, offering crucial breathing room to assess their options.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the ongoing government shutdown, driven by a dispute over Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, disproportionately harms working Americans while benefiting the wealthy. The author contends that President Trump has broken campaign promises to lower costs, instead implementing policies like tax breaks for billionaires that have increased the national debt and inflation. The piece criticizes the administration for prioritizing the construction of a White House ballroom while delaying crucial infrastructure projects, framing the shutdown as another instance of special treatment for the well-connected.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a plan to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and significantly reduce duty-free quotas, aiming to protect its industry from a surplus of Chinese steel. This aligns the EU's trade policy with tariffs previously imposed by the U.S. under President Trump. The UK steel industry has voiced alarm, describing the potential measures as an "existential threat" given that 80% of its steel exports are sent to the EU, which could face devastating consequences from the new levies.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Steven Gerrard has attributed the lack of major tournament success for his "Golden Generation" of players to a culture of ego and rivalry that prevented them from becoming a cohesive team. In a podcast interview, Gerrard stated that players from rival clubs were not connected or friendly, which undermined their performance on the international stage. He contrasted this with the improved team spirit fostered by current manager Gareth Southgate, suggesting the talent was always present but the right team culture was missing.</p>

The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm will move parallel to the coast of Baja California Sur while remaining offshore, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to the peninsula. While not expected to make landfall, Priscilla is generating dangerous swells, leading to life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along coastal areas.</p>

The lawsuit cites copyright concerns after a YouTube sketch portrayed Paddington as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears, advertises guns, and admits to using cocaine. This portrayal starkly contrasts with the gentle, well-mannered bear known to generations of children and adults from the original books and popular film adaptations.</p>

Currently, regional police handle most drone threats, but they lack the equipment to intercept them, while the German military is constitutionally barred from domestic operations except in a war scenario. This has created a security gap, prompting calls for federal authorities to take on greater responsibility for protecting critical infrastructure from such disruptions.</p>
