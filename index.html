          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 03:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canton Fair's operator is offering a 50% refund on booth fees for Chinese exporters, marking the first time in the trade show's history that such a reduction has been offered. This initiative aims to alleviate the impact of high tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and is part of a broader effort to support export-oriented businesses amid trade tensions. Fees for standard booths will now range from 7,500 to 11,000 yuan, with full exemptions for exhibitors in specific categories like ‚ÄúRural Revitalization Specialties‚Äù. Over 30,000 Chinese companies participating in the spring session stand to benefit from this measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early results from local council elections in the UK suggest that the Reform party is posing a significant challenge to the traditional dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. The party has secured a substantial percentage of the vote in declared results and has a good chance of winning overall control in key regions. While Reform's gains primarily come at the expense of the Conservatives, Labour's support has also diminished since the general election. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens are maintaining similar levels of support as in previous elections, but overall, British politics appears to be shifting away from dominance by any single party.</p>

          <p>Facing a trade war with the U.S. and struggling with weak domestic consumption, China is set to ease its ban on K-pop acts, signaling a potential policy shift. K-pop group Epex will perform in Fuzhou, marking the first all-Korean idol group concert in mainland China since 2016. The annual Dream Concert is also scheduled for Hainan province. Analysts believe this move is part of a broader strategy to revitalize domestic demand by promoting cultural events and stimulating discretionary spending in tourism and hospitality, as K-pop is considered a tariff-proof sector.</p>

          <p>Oil major Shell reported better-than-expected first-quarter profits and announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program, continuing its trend of returning capital to shareholders.

The judge ruled that the administration's use of the 18th-century wartime law was illegal, stating that the president's claims about a Venezuelan gang did not constitute an ‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù This ruling rejects the White House‚Äôs attempt to apply the Alien Enemies Act, intended for times of war or military invasion, to modern immigration policy.

          <p>Toyota, Honda, and other Japanese carmakers experienced strong sales growth in the U.S. in April, driven by customers rushing to purchase vehicles before expected price increases due to tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump implemented an additional tariff on cars produced outside the United States, leading customers to buy hybrid and SUV models in particular. While this surge boosted April sales, the outlook remains uncertain as this last-minute buying may reduce future demand. Toyota's sales rose 10%, Honda's 18.1%, Subaru's 0.3%, and Mazda's 21% due to these factors.</p>
