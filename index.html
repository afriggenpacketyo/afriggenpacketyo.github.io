        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SkyWest Airlines, the largest regional airline in the U.S., temporarily grounded all flights for 21 minutes on Friday night, according to the FAA. The ground stop advisory, issued at 0149 GMT and canceled at 0210 GMT, affected flights operated for United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines. The FAA provided no further details, and SkyWest did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the cause of the grounding. This incident highlights the potential for significant disruptions in air travel due to unforeseen operational issues. Optimism is slightly affected due to potential travel disruptions, but the brief nature of the grounding suggests a quick resolution. The grounding did not cause a plane crash, and was only a 21 minute disruption. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from expanding fast-track deportations nationwide, citing due process concerns for migrants. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb paused a January directive that broadened the expedited removal policy to apply anywhere in the country and to those who arrived within the past two years. Cobb stated that the expansion likely violates the due process rights of those affected, as it allows immigration officials to deport migrants quickly without allowing them to see an immigration judge, unless they claim asylum. The ruling is a major setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, but representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment. The judge's decision to protect due process rights is a positive development for immigrants and legal advocates. </p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie at the US Open in a match where Djokovic battled through a lower back injury to reach the fourth round. Norrie lost to Djokovic in four sets, with Djokovic requiring medical treatment during the match. Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th major title, acknowledged the challenges and expressed satisfaction with enduring the match. This victory marks Djokovic's first tournament since his Wimbledon semi-final loss, and he is now closer to securing another Grand Slam title. The triumph despite the injury shows resilience, though the injury itself tempers optimism.</p>

          <p>The FBI has discovered bones and potential evidence during a two-day search in Washington state for Travis Decker, who is accused of murdering his three daughters. The search, involving nearly 100 personnel, took place near Rock Island Campground in Leavenworth, Washington, an area with heavy vegetation. The bones are being analyzed to determine if they are human or animal, and other recovered items are also under investigation for links to the case. Decker is wanted on three counts of murder and kidnapping after his daughters' bodies were found in his truck on June 2. The discovery of potential evidence marks a significant step in the ongoing investigation.</p>

The brothers are looking forward to pizza and a good night's sleep after enduring challenging conditions and rationing supplies in the final weeks. The successful completion of this arduous journey is a remarkable achievement and testament to their resilience.</p>

          <p>Randy “Duke” Cunningham, a former US Navy flying ace and congressman, has died at the age of 83; Cunningham was known for his decorated military career during the Vietnam War, but his legacy was tarnished by a bribery scandal. He served eight terms in Congress before pleading guilty in 2005 to accepting $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors in exchange for government contracts. Cunningham was sentenced to over eight years in prison and later received a pardon from Donald Trump in 2021. His death marks the end of a controversial figure who experienced both great achievements and significant disgrace. </p>

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of Angeles Crest Highway has reopened to the public after being closed for years due to storm damage and fire. The highway, also known as Highway 2, had been closed due to heavy rains in 2022 and 2023, which caused slope failures, rock slides, and pavement collapse. The reopening provides access to popular hiking trails, reduces overcrowding at other trailheads, and benefits the local hiking community. The U.S. Forest Service has announced heightened fire danger warnings for the area, urging visitors to avoid campfires and open flames during Labor Day weekend. The highway reopening is a positive development, but the extreme fire danger requires vigilance. </p>

          <p>Three men were arrested during a protest outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, after the Court of Appeal overturned a temporary injunction that blocked asylum seekers from being housed there. Essex Police reported arrests for violent disorder, assaulting a police officer, and drink driving, with two officers sustaining minor injuries. The court's decision means 138 asylum seekers staying at the hotel will not be forced to leave by 12 September. Tensions in Epping have been high since protests began in July, following an arrest of an asylum seeker charged with sexual assault. While some residents expressed disappointment, others supported the court's decision, emphasizing the need for safety and consistency for the asylum seekers. The mixed reactions and arrests indicate ongoing community division. </p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired a Department of Justice official, Elizabeth Baxter, for making a vulgar gesture to members of the National Guard deployed in Washington, D.C. The incident involved Baxter, a paralegal, raising her middle finger and uttering vulgarities at National Guard members on August 18. President Donald Trump had deployed hundreds of National Guard members to Washington, D.C., declaring a crime emergency and announcing a temporary federal takeover of the city's police department. The firing underscores the administration's stance on supporting law enforcement, while the deployment of the National Guard reflects ongoing concerns about crime levels in the capital.

He claimed he faced retaliation after reporting his concerns internally, leading to a hostile work environment. The SSA refuted the claim, stating that the data was "walled off" from the internet.

The judges stated that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate a prior extension of TPS. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the decision, but legal experts hailed it as a victory for immigrants' rights.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris will receive protection from the California Highway Patrol after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection, according to law enforcement sources. California officials have implemented a plan to provide Harris with dignitary protection following the termination of her extended Secret Service security coverage. Trump signed a memorandum ending Harris’ protection as of Monday, despite a previous order by then-President Biden to extend it. The curtailing of Secret Service protection comes as Harris is about to begin a book tour for her memoir. The move has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the safety of the former Vice President. </p>

          <p>Mike Johnson responded to Gavin Newsom's remarks about Louisiana's crime rates being worse than California's, after Newsom suggested Trump should deploy troops to states like Louisiana. Johnson defended his hometown of Shreveport, stating that they have done a great job of reducing crime, but acknowledged that crime exists across America. Newsom had criticized Trump for deploying the National Guard in predominantly blue states and argued that if the president wanted to suppress more crime, he should focus on states with higher crime rates. The exchange highlights the ongoing debate over crime and law enforcement strategies. </p>

          <p>The White House is defending Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr after a tumultuous week at the CDC, with Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller calling Kennedy "a crown jewel of this administration". This follows the firing of CDC Chief Dr Susan Monarez and resignations of senior CDC leaders over concerns about Kennedy's leadership and vaccine policies. Kennedy, a vaccine critic, has faced criticism for funding cuts and changes to immunization regulations. The controversy has led to calls for Kennedy's resignation, with some lawmakers expressing unease over the developments at the CDC. The White House's support indicates continued confidence in Kennedy's leadership. </p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's U.S. House districts, following President Trump's request. The new map targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by expanding it into rural Republican-leaning areas. Kehoe also aims to pass a constitutional amendment making it harder to approve citizen-initiated ballot measures. Democrats have criticized the move as an attempt to gerrymander the state and suppress voter rights. The redistricting effort reflects a broader national trend of partisan gerrymandering. </p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been blocked from attending the UN General Assembly session in New York next month after he and 80 other Palestinian officials had their visas revoked. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited undermining peace efforts and seeking "the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state" as reasons. The decision is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials of all countries to the UN headquarters. The move has been welcomed by Israel but criticized by Palestinian officials. The decision is a significant diplomatic move that has implications for international relations. </p>

Analysts say that coffee and tea drinking trends are shifting, and chains like Costa are facing challenges due to higher coffee prices and cost of living pressures. Blank Street's success is attributed to its TikTok appeal and focus on new luxury drinks as an affordable treat. The need to adapt to changing consumer preferences is crucial for coffee chains. </p>

Experts say the shooting highlights the dangers of pseudo-law beliefs and the need for authorities to address the root causes.

          <p>A gym owner says she reported concerns about Sean Gardner's grooming behavior to USA Gymnastics years before his arrest on sexual abuse charges. Despite warnings from his former boss, gymnasts, and parents, Gardner was promoted at Chow’s Gymnastics and Dance Institute. Concerns included inappropriate touching and discussions, but the gym owner, Liang “Chow” Qiao, did not take sufficient action. Gardner was eventually banned from gymnastics in 2022 and arrested in 2025 for child sexual exploitation. The case highlights failures within the sport's governing bodies to protect young athletes. </p>
