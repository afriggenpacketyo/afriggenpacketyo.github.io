          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has publicly dismissed recent peace overtures from South Korea's new presidential administration. In a statement, she criticized Seoul's reliance on its military alliance with the United States and indicated that Pyongyang has no interest in resuming dialogue. This formal rejection follows a series of minor de-escalation efforts by the South, including the cessation of propaganda broadcasts, signaling that deep-seated mistrust continues to define inter-Korean relations.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in specific areas of Gaza to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid amid a worsening hunger crisis. This measure is intended to create secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to distribute essential supplies like food and medicine. Despite this development, aid organizations and international leaders stress that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the catastrophic conditions, as the limited pause is insufficient to reach all civilians in need.</p>
