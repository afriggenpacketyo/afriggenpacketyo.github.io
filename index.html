          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions. Ward's selection marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen first overall. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, a two-way player, while the draft emphasized offensive and defensive lines with seven of the first 12 picks being linemen. The draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, lacked the depth of blue-chip prospects seen in previous years, leading to more unpredictability in team selections.</p>

          <p>Faustin Nsabumukunzi, a beekeeper living in the Hamptons, has been arrested and charged with immigration fraud for allegedly concealing his participation in the Rwandan genocide. Prosecutors claim Nsabumukunzi directed Hutus to kill Tutsis, personally attacked Tutsis, and ordered the disposal of Tutsi bodies, referring to them as "trash." He is accused of lying about his involvement when seeking refugee status and later applying for permanent residency and citizenship in the United States. If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison and potential deportation to Rwanda, where he has been wanted for nearly two decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funds from cities and counties with sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with U.S. immigration officials. Judge William Orrick issued a temporary injunction, declaring portions of Trump's executive orders unconstitutional. The judge stated that withholding funding would cause irreparable harm, including budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust between communities and local governments. The ruling is a setback for the administration's crackdown on immigration, with plaintiffs arguing the orders were an overreach attempting to force cities to participate in mass deportation efforts.</p>

Cassis stressed the importance of maintaining strong partnerships with the European Union and the US, despite the challenges posed by protectionist measures.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that China could enhance its soft power in Africa by adopting a non-governmental organization (NGO) model similar to Western nations. While China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects, its approach has largely been government-to-government, lacking the grassroots relationships and community engagement that Western NGOs cultivate. The author argues that an NGO model tailored to China's context could improve its public image and build stronger human connections across the continent, addressing concerns about neocolonialism and cultural clashes.</p>

          <p>President Trump, reversing his previous stance, directly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the deadly attacks on Kyiv, which killed 12 and injured 90. This comes amid Trump's renewed efforts to broker an end to the Ukraine war, reportedly on terms favorable to Russia. Domestically, a federal judge blocked Trump's attempts to change voting requirements, which advocates argued would disenfranchise millions of voters. The judge stated that Trump's administration was illegally asserting power it does not have, as courts already determined during Trump’s first Administration.</p>

          <p>Supported housing, which provides independent living assistance to vulnerable individuals, is in crisis due to funding cuts and rising costs, according to an open letter signed by over 170 organizations. Services have been forced to shut down, leading to a shortfall of approximately 325,000 places, and further closures are feared without increased government funding. Advocates are calling for long-term funding of at least £1.6 billion per year for councils and for supported homes to be included in the government's housing plans. The government acknowledges the vital role of supported housing and is investing in social and affordable housebuilding.</p>

          <p>U.S. authorities are conducting a criminal antitrust investigation into TP-Link Systems Inc, examining its pricing strategies and potential national security risks associated with its growing market share. The Department of Justice is investigating whether TP-Link engaged in predatory pricing that could harm other router companies without national security concerns. There have been widespread concerns about Beijing potentially exploiting Chinese-origin routers for cyber attacks. TP-Link Systems states it has split from and no longer has any affiliation with the Chinese TP-Link Technologies Co.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration experienced a series of legal setbacks in federal courts across the country. Judges blocked the government from withholding federal funds to schools with DEI programs and from cutting off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. A federal judge also blocked the administration from requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Additionally, a Boston judge is probing whether the Trump administration violated a court order regarding the removal of alleged gang members, and a judge in Maryland ordered the return of a man deported to El Salvador.</p>
