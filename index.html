          <p>The manhunt for Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. soldier suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has become the state's highest priority. Governor Greg Gianforte has authorized additional resources for the multi-agency search effort in the mountainous region where the suspect fled. Authorities consider Brown, who has a history of mental health issues, to be armed and extremely dangerous. The shooting has deeply affected the small community, and a $10,000 reward is offered for information leading to his capture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Snap's stock price dropped significantly after the company reported second-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street's expectations for global average revenue per user (ARPU). The company attributed the weaker-than-expected topline growth to a flawed advertising platform update, which has since been reverted, and other external factors. Despite the miss, Snap's daily active users exceeded forecasts, and the company provided a third-quarter revenue outlook that was ahead of analyst estimates. The report contrasts with stronger ad revenue performance from some of its social media peers. (not investment advice)</p>

The company reported second-quarter revenue of $139 million, significantly surpassing analysts' expectations and marking a 55% increase from the previous year. While Hinge reported a substantial net loss, largely due to stock-based compensation expenses, it also showed strong client growth and issued an optimistic revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter and full year.

The data center segment, which includes its AI chips, also saw 14% growth as AMD positions itself as a key alternative to Nvidia.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has instructed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding allegations that Donald Trump's political opponents conspired to falsely link him to Russia during the 2016 election. This move follows the declassification of an appendix from the Durham report, which cited a memo alleging a Clinton campaign plan to smear Trump. The proceedings could potentially lead to formal charges, though it remains unclear who might be targeted. The action re-ignites the long-standing political debate over the "Russiagate" controversy and the conduct of intelligence and law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration is reportedly considering the cancellation of the "Solar for All" program, a $7 billion initiative from the Biden era. The program was designed to provide grants to install solar panels in approximately 900,000 low-income households across the country. An EPA spokesperson indicated that the agency is working to implement congressional intent from the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes provisions to phase out solar tax credits. This potential move reflects a significant policy shift away from the previous administration's green energy priorities.</p>

          <p>Server manufacturer Super Micro Computer experienced a sharp decline in its stock price after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Both adjusted earnings per share and revenue missed consensus estimates, and the company issued a disappointing earnings forecast for the upcoming quarter. This performance marks a slowdown from the surging demand the company saw in 2023 for its AI-focused servers. Despite the near-term weakness, Super Micro provided a long-term revenue forecast for fiscal year 2026 that is above current analyst projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023 was a preventable tragedy caused by a "toxic" safety culture at OceanGate. The report states the company used intimidation tactics to evade regulatory oversight and operated outside established deep-sea protocols. Investigators found that the vessel's design was flawed and its structural integrity was likely compromised in previous incidents, with warnings from employees being ignored. The report blames the company's late CEO, Stockton Rush, for his overconfidence and negligence which contributed to the deaths of all five people aboard.</p>

          <p>Following the departure of over 50 Democratic lawmakers from Texas to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, questions have arisen about Governor Greg Abbott's authority to remove them from office. While the Texas House Speaker has signed civil arrest warrants to compel their return, these are not enforceable outside the state. Legal experts note that removing a lawmaker typically requires a two-thirds vote of the legislature for expulsion, a high bar that cannot be met without the Democrats present. The governor's threats are seen by some analysts as largely political posturing in the ongoing constitutional standoff.</p>

The proposed plan could grant Republicans up to five additional seats in the U.S. House, a shift that could be decisive in determining control of Congress in the next midterm elections. The move by Texas Republicans, encouraged by Donald Trump, has prompted Democratic governors in states like California and New York to consider retaliatory gerrymandering, potentially setting off a nationwide redistricting "arms race."</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion column posits that Kamala Harris is unlikely to be a successful presidential candidate, citing the Democratic Party's deep unpopularity and her own political weaknesses. The author argues that voters are dissatisfied with the party for both losing to Trump and failing to be an effective opposition, a sentiment Harris symbolizes. The piece suggests her political style, seen as crafted by focus groups, fails to connect with voters craving authenticity and is ill-suited to win back those who have left the party. The column concludes that nominating her again would likely lead to another defeat.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered their largest annual drop in coral cover since record-keeping began nearly 40 years ago. The decline is attributed primarily to severe and widespread coral bleaching caused by unprecedented heat stress from climate change, compounded by cyclones and starfish outbreaks. The report warns that the reef's ecosystem is highly volatile and may be approaching a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events. This highlights the urgent threat that warming ocean temperatures pose to the iconic world heritage site.</p>
