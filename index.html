          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault ring who accused powerful figures like Prince Andrew, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Giuffre had previously posted about suffering from renal failure due to injuries sustained in a car accident, according to an Instagram post in March. She played a crucial role in exposing Epstein's sex-trafficking crimes, which led to his arrest in 2019 and subsequent suicide in jail. Giuffre's allegations against Prince Andrew resulted in a settlement in 2022, though he denied any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, a growing separatist movement is gaining traction, fueled by dissatisfaction with Liberal rule and comparisons to the United States. Some residents feel culturally closer to Montana and Texas than to other parts of Canada, and are advocating for either independence or joining the U.S. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has warned of a "national unity crisis" if the province's demands regarding oil and gas production are not met, and some analysts believe this could challenge the country's next prime minister, even if the Conservative leader wins the election. While outright separation remains unlikely, the issue highlights a growing divide between Western Canada and the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>Joseph Koenig has been found guilty of first-degree murder for throwing a rock that killed Alexa Bartell, along with multiple other charges related to attacks on other vehicles in Colorado. Two co-defendants, Nicholas Karol-Chik and Zachary Kwak, testified against Koenig as part of their plea agreements, claiming he threw the fatal rock. The defense argued for a reckless manslaughter charge, but the jury convicted Koenig on all counts, some of which were downgraded.

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges.

The judge criticized Santos for a lack of remorse, while Santos claimed he betrayed his supporters and the institutions he served. Santos was ordered to pay over $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture, and will report to prison on July 25.</p>

          <p>Canada is preparing for federal elections with a tight race expected between the ruling Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Mark Carney, and the opposition Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre.

Pierre Poilievre is known for his confrontational style and promises to return to "common sense politics." The Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, and the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, are also key players in the election.</p>

Researchers believe the sound activates the vestibular system by stimulating the otolithic organs in the inner ear.

          <p>Sudan's National Museum, a symbol of the nation's history and culture, has been heavily damaged during the ongoing war, with officials reporting the destruction or theft of tens of thousands of artifacts. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are suspected of looting the museum and selling valuables, potentially in the United Arab Emirates. The government plans to contact Interpol and UNESCO to recover the stolen artifacts. The destruction mirrors the individual stories of many Sudanese, forced to flee with their homes occupied and valuables stolen.</p>

Senator Ed Markey has called for exemptions for smaller enterprises, noting their vulnerability to rising costs. Small businesses lack the financial reserves and supply chain diversity of larger corporations, making them more susceptible to the impact of tariffs. Some business owners report that tariffs are already forcing them to abandon orders and reduce operations. (not investment advice)</p>

Reports suggest the U.S. is proposing a deal that would involve Ukraine ceding territory to Russia, which Zelensky has rejected. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.</p>
