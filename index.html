          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it will slow the pace of government bond purchases from April of next year, maintaining its benchmark rate at 0.5% amid rising growth risks. The BOJ plans to reduce its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by about 400 billion yen per quarter until March 2026, aiming for about 3 trillion yen monthly. Starting April 2026, the cuts will slow to 200 billion yen per quarter until March 2027, targeting a monthly purchase amount of about 2 trillion yen. This adjustment aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets and support market stability, with another assessment scheduled for June 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The jury in the Karen Read murder trial is deliberating after a second lengthy trial in Dedham, Massachusetts, where Read is accused of killing her Boston cop boyfriend in a drunken hit-and-run. Jurors deliberated for just under two hours on Friday and returned for their first full day on Monday after Read's first trial ended in a hung jury last year. The article compares the deliberation times of other high-profile murder cases, including OJ Simpson, Casey Anthony, Scott Peterson, and Alex Murdaugh, to provide context. A New York City defense attorney suggests that the longer the jurors deliberate, the better it looks for Read.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce new sanctions targeting Russia at the G7 summit, aimed at increasing economic pressure on the Kremlin amid ongoing strikes against Ukraine. The UK is expected to unveil a new sanctions package designed to "restrict Putin's war machine" alongside other Ukraine allies, focusing on squeezing Russia's energy revenues. However, it appeared unlikely that the US would join the move after Donald Trump signaled his opposition to further measures during the G7 summit in Canada, saying the sanctions "cost [the US] a lot of money". Trump also called Russia's removal from the G7 group "a mistake" and said it "makes life more complicated".</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made limited progress in bridging tariff gaps during their summit, casting doubt on a quick, mutually beneficial agreement. Ishiba emphasized the need for any deal to serve both countries' interests and acknowledged remaining differences after "candid" discussions. The U.S. has granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but the 25% tariff on autos remains a key sticking point for Japan. Japan exported around 1.38 million vehicles to the United States in 2024, while Japanese automakers produce 3.28 million cars and light trucks in the United States annually.

Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment of women who terminate their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners.

          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on the global arms exports market, driven by security concerns rather than solely for profit. The primary motivation is to deepen ties and improve interoperability with allies and partners, achieved through standardized maintenance and joint training. Exporting arms will also help develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has suffered from limited domestic demand and reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. Veteran investor David Roche suggests that a more transactional approach from the U.S. necessitates Japan to invest more in its own defense.</p>
