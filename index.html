          <p>The Trump administration is withholding nearly $7 billion in congressionally approved funds for various educational programs, including after-school initiatives, teacher training, and support for English language learners. Officials claim the funds are under review, but critics argue this is an unconstitutional act of impoundment, a move to defund programs the administration opposes. This action is seen as part of a broader strategy to challenge Congress's spending authority, led by the Office of Management and Budget. The decision is expected to face significant legal challenges from states and school districts that had already budgeted for the money.</p>

          <p>A New York jury found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty on two counts of transportation for prostitution but acquitted him of more severe charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. The convictions relate to transporting women across state lines for illegal sex acts under the Mann Act. Prosecutors had alleged Combs ran a criminal enterprise that coerced women into sexual encounters, but the defense argued the activities were consensual. Combs faces a maximum of 10 years in prison for each of the two guilty counts, while the acquittal on the racketeering charge was a significant victory for his legal team.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling to block President Trump's policy that effectively bans migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss determined that the president overstepped his authority, stating that the proclamation and its implementation were not supported by the Immigration and Nationality Act or the Constitution. The policy was based on Trump's declaration of an emergency and an "invasion" at the southern border. The judge has stayed the ruling for two weeks to allow the government time to appeal, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the institution will continue after his death, confirming that a successor will be chosen through the traditional reincarnation process.

          <p>British tennis has seen contrasting fortunes at Wimbledon, with Sonay Kartal advancing while Katie Boulter faced a disappointing exit. After a strong first-round win, Boulter, the British number two, lost a lead to fall in three sets to a lower-ranked opponent. In contrast, 23-year-old Kartal has thrived, defeating a seeded player to reach the third round for the first time and enjoying an impressive rise in the rankings over the past year. Kartal's success highlights her rapid development and maturity, as she continues her run in front of a home crowd at the prestigious tournament.</p>

          <p>Following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, a federal judge has denied Sean Combs' request for bail, ordering him to remain in detention until sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian cited Combs' "propensity for violence" as a key factor in his decision, specifically referencing the 2016 hotel surveillance video showing him physically assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. The judge stated it was impossible for the defense to demonstrate that Combs poses no danger to the community. Ventura's attorney noted that while she is at peace with the verdict, she may provide a victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing.</p>

Her high name recognition and favorability ratings give her a significant advantage over other contenders, who remain largely unknown to the public.

          <p>A new book, "Apple in China," has sparked discussion among analysts about whether the tech giant has become overly dependent on the country for its manufacturing and operations. During a think tank event, Harvard Business School professor Meg Rithmire argued that Apple likely had no better alternative and that participating in China's innovation wave was essential to becoming the company it is today. The book's author, Patrick McGee, contends that Apple made a "calamitous mistake" by consolidating its operations in an authoritarian state. This debate highlights the complex strategic challenges faced by multinational corporations operating in China.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that Sean "Diddy" Combs's acquittal on the most severe charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, despite being convicted on two lesser felonies, may pave the way for a public redemption story. The article argues that prosecutors may have overreached with the complex racketeering charge, which is difficult to prove. It posits that the verdict allows Combs and his supporters to frame him as a victim of a flawed prosecution and bitter ex-girlfriends. This narrative could tap into a cultural trend of rehabilitating powerful men, potentially overshadowing the seriousness of the crimes for which he was convicted.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and sparked a large fire. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening, prompted mandatory evacuations in a one-mile radius and caused a smoke plume that reached up to 15,000 feet. The blasts destroyed several structures and ignited multiple grass fires covering approximately 80 acres. Two people were treated for injuries, but authorities are still working to determine the whereabouts of the seven missing individuals. Family members have gathered nearby, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones who were believed to be inside the facility.</p>

This deal avoids a potential 46% levy that was scheduled to take effect next week. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are made in other countries, such as China, and then routed through Vietnam in a process known as transshipment. In return, Trump stated that Vietnam will grant the U.S. "total access" to its markets with zero tariffs on American products.
