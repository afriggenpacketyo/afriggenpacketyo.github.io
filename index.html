The company has seen significant success with its Pavilia Forest project, a joint venture with Far East Consortium, generating over HK$4.2 billion from the sale of more than 600 flats. Additionally, NWD has sold 500 units across its Deep Water Pavilia projects, accumulating nearly HK$8.8 billion in sales. These results highlight robust demand for high-end properties in the region, bolstering the developer's financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's government has passed a law to ban social media use for individuals under 16, aiming to address a perceived youth mental health crisis linked to platforms like TikTok and Instagram. The ban, supported by a majority of Australians, includes substantial fines for non-compliant tech companies but does not penalize underage users or their parents. However, some experts question the causal link between social media and mental illness, arguing the ban is a simplistic solution to a complex issue. Critics also note that social media can provide vital communities for marginalized youth and that a ban may push them to less-regulated corners of the internet.</p>

The company is proceeding with another $3.5 billion in share buybacks, continuing a consistent trend of shareholder returns for the 15th consecutive quarter. This performance follows a strategic update in March aimed at prioritizing value creation, cost savings, and simplifying operations, which has been well-received by investors. Shell's stock has consequently outperformed several of its major U.S. and European competitors this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Cyberspace Administration (CAC) has raised national security concerns regarding Nvidia's H20 AI chips, which were recently cleared for export to China by Washington. The regulator has requested that Nvidia provide documentation to address potential vulnerabilities, including alleged "tracking and positioning" and "remote shutdown" capabilities. These concerns appear to stem from proposed U.S. legislation that would require advanced chips to include location-reporting systems to prevent smuggling and misuse. The situation highlights the escalating tech tensions, as Beijing scrutinizes chip security while some U.S. lawmakers worry the H20 will advance China's AI capabilities.</p>

          <p>A failure in the UK's air traffic control (ATC) system, managed by NATS, caused significant travel disruption, leading to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounding thousands more. The radar-related issue was resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, but the knock-on effects have continued, with airlines demanding answers and accountability. This incident follows a similar major outage in August 2023, prompting criticism from airlines like Ryanair, whose executive called for the resignation of the NATS CEO. The disruption occurred during the peak summer travel season, leaving many passengers stranded and facing ongoing delays.</p>

          <p>The crew of China's Shenzhou-19 mission revealed that their record-breaking spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task outside their spacecraft. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe stated that a payload adaptor, a critical docking mechanism for external experiments and maintenance, became jammed during a cargo installation procedure. Lacking specialized tools and with limited time, the astronauts had to collaborate with the ground team to devise and execute an unrehearsed solution. This successful improvisation highlights the crew's resourcefulness and the robustness of China's crewed spaceflight operations.</p>

          <h2>China's Manufacturing Sector Contracts for Fourth Consecutive Month</h2>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction and missing analyst expectations. The slowdown is attributed to several factors, including extreme weather like heatwaves and torrential rain, a traditional off-season for production, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for new orders and employment also contracted, reflecting weakening demand and economic pressure. The decline in both manufacturing and services activity aligns with forecasts for slower growth in the second half of the year as the impact of U.S. tariffs becomes more apparent.

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat has suggested that the European Union's recent trade agreement with Washington will deepen the bloc's economic and security dependence on the United States. Shi Mingde, China's former ambassador to Germany, argued that the deal contradicts the EU's stated goal of achieving strategic autonomy and reducing reliance on single partners. Speaking at an event in Beijing, Shi criticized the EU's "de-risking" policy toward China as flawed, pointing out that Europe's dependence on the U.S. is already stronger. His comments reflect Beijing's perspective that the EU's moves are a veiled attempt to contain Chinese growth.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September. The move is conditional on the Palestinian Authority committing to governance reforms and holding general elections next year in which Hamas cannot participate. The decision aligns Canada with France and the UK, reflecting growing international pressure on Israel amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel criticized the announcement as a "reward for Hamas," while the White House stated that President Trump also opposes the move, believing it undermines efforts to secure a ceasefire and release hostages.</p>

          <p>Ford has increased its forecast for the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion this year. The automaker, which manufactures most of its vehicles in America, has already paid an extra $800 million in duties in the second quarter alone. The higher-than-expected costs are attributed to sustained tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, where Ford has facilities, as well as levies on imported steel and aluminum. The announcement underscores the significant effect of the Trump administration's trade policies on major American corporations, even those with large domestic operations. (not investment advice)</p>

Her lawyer argued that testifying without such protections would compromise her constitutional rights and ongoing legal appeals.

This potential move into direct competition with its customers, such as Apple and Qualcomm, was noted by an analyst on the earnings call as a possible "execution risk." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law a controversial bill that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-old minors for sex. The new law, AB 379, allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The legislation faced debate among Democrats, with some raising concerns that related provisions could be used to profile minority groups. The final version represents a compromise and also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders.</p>

          <p>Key U.S. allies, including Canada, the UK, and France, are breaking with the Trump administration's policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by announcing plans to recognize a Palestinian state. This diplomatic shift highlights a growing chasm between the U.S. and European nations over the future of Gaza and the lack of a clear long-term peace plan from Washington. The article notes that while the previous administration had laid out principles for a post-war Gaza, the current one has largely aligned with Israel's positions and boycotted a recent UN conference on the issue. European nations, spurred by the humanitarian crisis, are now attempting to fill the strategic vacuum.</p>

          <p>One of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, an 8.8 magnitude temblor, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. Tsunami warnings and advisories were issued for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, Japan, and countries in South America, prompting evacuations and beach closures. While the most severe warnings for the U.S. were later downgraded or canceled, the event caused minor flooding in Hawaii and small but dangerous waves along the West Coast. The quake caused flooding in Russia and appeared to trigger a volcanic eruption on the Kamchatka peninsula, a highly active seismic region.</p>
