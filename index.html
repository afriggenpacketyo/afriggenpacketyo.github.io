          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte described the upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as a critical test of Putin's seriousness in ending the war. Rutte emphasized that while Trump is initiating the dialogue, any final peace deal must involve Ukraine and Europe, and will not compromise Ukraine's future geopolitical position or sovereignty. He confirmed that lethal military aid to Ukraine, coordinated by NATO, will continue regardless of the summit's outcome, ensuring Ukraine remains in the strongest possible negotiating position. Rutte stressed that Putin will never be able to divide the united alliance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for an aggressive federal response to crime in Washington, D.C., following a recent assault on a former government official. In a series of social media posts, he warned the city's homeless population to relocate immediately, promising to provide alternative places to stay far from the capital. This renewed focus on the District includes an increased presence of federal law enforcement, despite data showing a decline in violent crime. D.C.

          <p>A senior Russian official and ally of Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, has warned that unnamed countries are making "titanic efforts" to disrupt the planned summit between President Trump and the Russian leader. The meeting, scheduled for August 15 in Alaska, aims to discuss a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine, which is now in its fourth year. Dmitriev, who serves as Russia's investment envoy, suggested that critics might use diplomatic maneuvers or media provocations to undermine the talks. The Kremlin confirmed the summit's focus will be on achieving a long-term peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A protest in London supporting the recently banned organization Palestine Action resulted in 532 arrests, the largest number by the Metropolitan Police in a single day in the last decade. The majority of arrests were for displaying placards in support of the group, which the government proscribed as a terrorist organization in July. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds simultaneously reveal supportive signs. While Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban based on security advice, Amnesty International criticized the mass arrests as a threat to freedom of expression under overly broad terrorism laws.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are fiercely opposing a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas, with some fleeing the state to deny a legislative quorum. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker labeled the move as "cheating" and an attempt by Governor Greg Abbott to undermine democracy at Donald Trump's behest. In response, Abbott has threatened to have the Democratic lawmakers arrested upon their return to Texas and has vowed to call continuous special sessions until the matter is resolved. The proposed maps could potentially give Republicans an advantage in picking up five House seats in the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to achieve the "complete the defeat of Hamas" and end the war speedily. Speaking to foreign media, he asserted that Israel's goal is not occupation but to "free Gaza," with plans to funnel civilians into safe zones while dismantling Hamas's last strongholds. The plan has drawn international condemnation and prompted an emergency UN Security Council meeting, where the US defended Israel's right to act for its security. The announcement comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis and reports of more Palestinian deaths while seeking aid.</p>

However, former SEC official Amanda Fischer warns of the high volatility and speculative nature of crypto assets, comparing the current fervor to the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis and cautioning that consumers remain vulnerable to sophisticated scams.

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as Surgeon General during the first Trump administration, warned that "people are going to die" following the decision by HHS Secretary Robert F.

Adams lamented that the cuts would stall progress in treating diseases like cancer and HIV.

          <p>This article explores the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that beyond her reputation as a comic wit lies a profound religious writer whose theology is communicated through narrative form. A new biography, "Electric Spark" by Frances Wilson, highlights how Spark's conversion to Catholicism and her experiences, including working in psychological warfare during WWII, shaped her fiction. The essay details how Spark often played God in her novels, using devices like prolepsis to explore themes of fate, free will, and divine judgment. Her work is characterized by a unique blend of droll absurdity and a serious engagement with the capricious nature of God.</p>

          <p>An environmental scientist is using TikTok to counter a common myth about climate change, explaining that while the Earth does undergo natural warming and cooling cycles, the current rapid warming is undeniably influenced by human activity. In a video, she presents charts from scientific institutions like the EPA to demonstrate how human emissions of greenhouse gases have drastically accelerated this natural process. This accelerated warming leads to more severe weather, threatens biodiversity, and is projected to have staggering economic costs. The article emphasizes that individual, consumer, and civic actions can help mitigate these effects.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have strongly rejected a claim in Nicola Sturgeon's forthcoming memoir that Salmond himself might have leaked details of a sexual misconduct investigation against him. In 2020, Salmond was acquitted of 13 charges, including attempted sexual assault. Alba party leader Kenny MacAskill labeled Sturgeon a "hypocrite" for the suggestion, reigniting calls for a public inquiry into the government's handling of the original complaints. The journalist who broke the story also expressed skepticism about the claim, highlighting the deep and lasting rift between the two former leaders of the Scottish independence movement.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology after a shoe he designed in collaboration with Adidas Originals drew criticism for cultural appropriation. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals but was reportedly made in China without crediting or partnering with the Indigenous communities who originated the design. The issue drew comments from Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who stated her government was exploring legal options to support the affected communities. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the shoe was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to invite Vladimir Putin to a summit in Alaska, despite an international arrest warrant for the Russian leader, is a high-stakes fulfillment of a major campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine. The article analyzes the complex dynamics, noting European and Ukrainian fears that Trump might broker a deal that concedes territory to Russia. The summit follows months of stalled negotiations and was reportedly set in motion by back-channel discussions led by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. While Trump is open to including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, the meeting is currently planned as a bilateral one at Putin's request.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with more sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly deploying AI agents as a crucial part of their cyber defense forces. These autonomous agents help security teams by automating tasks like detection, analysis, and responding to alerts, which frees up human workers for more strategic work and helps address the industry's talent shortage. According to Brian Murphy, CEO of ReliaQuest, AI allows defenders to filter out irrelevant noise and multiply their capabilities. While the technology is still evolving, it is seen as an essential augmentation to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.</p>
