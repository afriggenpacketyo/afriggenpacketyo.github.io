          <p>President Trump's major tax and spending bill, which narrowly passed the Senate with a tie-breaking vote, now faces a difficult path in the House of Representatives.

However, the lower rates did not substantially motivate new homebuyers, as purchase applications remained nearly flat, indicating persistent uncertainty within the housing market.

          <p>The jury in the federal trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs has announced it is deadlocked on the most serious charge he faces: racketeering conspiracy, which carries a potential life sentence. This charge, formally under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, alleges that Combs directed a criminal enterprise using his network of associates to commit crimes like sex trafficking and obstruction of justice. To secure a conviction, prosecutors must prove a complex, coordinated plan to commit multiple crimes over several years, a challenging legal standard.</p>

          <p>Karen Kneller, the chief executive of the UK's Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), has resigned from her position following months of intense criticism. The CCRC, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, was severely condemned for its "failing" of Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Kneller's departure follows that of the CCRC chair earlier this year, as the embattled organization faces calls for a complete leadership overhaul to restore public confidence in its vital role.</p>

          <p>Researchers believe they have solved the mystery of why Earth remained lethally hot for 5 million years following the "Great Dying" mass extinction 252 million years ago. A new study analyzing a vast fossil archive from China suggests the widespread collapse of tropical forests was the key factor. The loss of vegetation crippled the planet's ability to absorb and store atmospheric carbon, even after the initial volcanic activity had ceased, creating a persistent "super greenhouse" state. The findings serve as a stark warning about modern climate tipping points.</p>
