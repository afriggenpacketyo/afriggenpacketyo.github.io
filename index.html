          <p>The increasing prevalence of mental health days for students reflects the significant stress and mental health challenges faced by young people today. While some worry that allowing mental health days might encourage school avoidance, experts emphasize their role in preventing crises and destigmatizing mental illness.  The ideal use of mental health days involves proactive planning for rest and recovery, not simply avoiding school.  Addressing the underlying causes of student stress, such as early school start times and lack of downtime, is crucial.</p>
