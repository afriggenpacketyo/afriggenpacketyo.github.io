          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-centric fundraising events this month, including a $1.5 million-per-plate dinner for political donors and a gala for holders of the $TRUMP memetoken. The first event, hosted by MAGA Inc., features David Sacks, who is influencing crypto and AI regulations, signaling a policy shift welcomed by the crypto community after perceived opposition from the Biden administration. The second event offers access to Trump's inner circle based on the number of $TRUMP tokens held, with top holders promised dinner with Trump himself, highlighting the intersection of crypto culture and political fundraising. MAGA Inc. will receive the funds, however the president is constitutionally barred from running for a third term.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett revealed his plans to step down as CEO, naming Greg Abel as his successor, which the board unanimously approved, effective January 1, 2026. The market reacted to this news alongside an earnings decline, causing Class A shares to drop 4.9% to $769,593 and Class B shares to fall to $513.17. While investors process the transition, analysts like Macrae Sykes emphasize Buffett's continued role as chairman will provide mentorship and strategic guidance during this period of change. This succession marks the end of Buffett's 60-year leadership, transforming Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration for tariff exclusions for small businesses importing goods, citing the potential for significant damage to America's Main Street and increased recession risk. Suzanne Clark, president and CEO of the Chamber, emphasized that small businesses lack the financial reserves to withstand tariff increases, which could force them to raise prices for consumers. Economists have warned that the administration's tariff policies are already impacting growth, but President Trump has indicated that trade deals could be reached soon. Senator Ed Markey has also called for tariff exemptions for small businesses, highlighting their vulnerability to price shocks and supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is in discussions with countries like Angola and Equatorial Guinea to accept migrants deported from the U.S., including those who are not citizens of those countries, according to internal government documents. This effort is part of a broader campaign to deport migrants whose home countries refuse to take them back, with the administration already brokering agreements with Latin American countries to accept third-country deportees. One idea under consideration involves deporting suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to these third countries, raising concerns about the treatment of deportees by governments that are not their own. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the administration's active search for countries willing to take these individuals, emphasizing the desire to send them as far away from America as possible.</p>

This announcement follows plans by the Commanders and city officials to return the team to D.C. with a new domed facility by 2030, though D.C. Council approval is still needed.

          <p>Israel's government has approved plans for its forces to capture the entire Gaza Strip and maintain control of the territory for an unspecified period, according to Israeli officials. This expansion plan aims to defeat Hamas and free hostages but is expected to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis and face international opposition. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would be "intensive" and involve moving Gaza's population for their protection, while the European Union voiced concerns about further casualties and suffering. The plan also seeks to prevent Hamas from distributing aid, with Israel considering using private security companies to control aid distribution, a move the UN opposes.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved plans to escalate its military campaign in Gaza, authorizing the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists to strengthen and expand operations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the goal is to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages and destroy its infrastructure, including expanding and holding territories within Gaza indefinitely. As part of the offensive, Israel intends to move the Gazan population south, mirroring actions taken earlier in the war. However, critics question whether this strategy will achieve its goals, citing the failure of previous campaigns to eliminate Hamas or secure the release of all hostages, while the organization representing the families of hostages urged the government not to widen the war.</p>

Experts worry about the impact on relationships with other countries and the potential for retaliation, as Hollywood relies heavily on international box office sales. It is unclear what part of the production process would be hit with this duty, and questions are already swirling.</p>

          <p>Increased tensions between the US and Iran have brought renewed attention to Iran's oil exports to China and the challenges the US faces in curbing them. Despite US sanctions, Iran continues to export significant amounts of oil, primarily to China, using clandestine operations such as "shadow fleets" and ship-to-ship transfers. Analysts suggest that the US has lost leverage over China due to the tariff war, making it more difficult to enforce sanctions. Experts emphasize the need for stronger enforcement and cooperation with local governments to disrupt the shadow tanker network.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could influence mortgage rates, but experts anticipate rates will likely remain unchanged for May. While a rate cut is deemed unlikely, the Fed Chairman's post-meeting press conference could offer insights into future actions, potentially affecting borrowing costs.

The award, named after President Kennedy's book, recognizes Pence's commitment to ensuring the constitutional transfer of presidential power. Despite receiving the award, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party since leaving office.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies have cautioned that imposing tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would increase drug costs and potentially lead to shortages, disproportionately affecting American patients. Drugmakers are preparing for potential tariffs, with President Trump hinting at a possible reprieve for companies that move operations to the U.S. A 25% tariff on pharmaceutical imports could increase drug costs in the U.S. by almost $51 billion annually, raising prices by up to 12.9%. Some drugmakers are investing in U.S. manufacturing to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs, but generic drugmakers may find it more challenging to shift production.</p>

Trace amounts of DNA fragments from the human cell lines may remain after purification, but they are biologically inert and cannot cause harm.

The model, outlined at a rare central party conference on periphery diplomacy in April, echoed Xiâ€™s 2014 call for Asians to independently manage their own security and also capitalised on regional doubts about Washingtonâ€™s dependability, they said. But analysts cautioned that Beijingâ€™s efforts to project itself as a benign security partner remain challenging, amid escalating territorial disputes with its neighbours, notably in the South China Sea, and the escalating rivalry with Washington.</p>
