          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge ruled that Cook showed a strong likelihood that the removal attempt violated the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, suggesting it applies to conduct in office, not prior allegations. This decision allows Cook to participate in the upcoming Fed meeting and underscores the legal battle over the central bank's independence from political interference. The White House has stated it will continue to contest the ruling.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's government announced the seizure of 1.4 tons of cocaine, valued at approximately $35 million, found floating in the Pacific Ocean about 1,000 miles from its coast. President Nayib Bukele framed the operation as a significant blow against international drug trafficking, noting that the country has confiscated over 37 tons of cocaine since 2024. The U.S. Embassy praised the seizure, highlighting growing cooperation in combating criminal networks that use Central America as a key transit route for narcotics heading to the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists anticipate that key inflation reports for August will indicate a rise in prices, with the annual headline Consumer Price Index potentially reaching its highest level since January. Despite this expected increase, analysts believe the Federal Reserve may still proceed with an interest rate cut at its next meeting. The rationale is that the price hikes are largely driven by tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader service sector inflation, and policymakers are increasingly concerned about a weakening jobs market. This complex economic picture presents a challenge for the central bank's policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

The incredible catch occurred in the fourth inning and momentarily kept the Padres in the game. However, Stephenson later hit a decisive two-run home run in the ninth inning, securing a 4-2 victory for the Reds. The win keeps Cincinnati's wildcard playoff hopes alive, while the Padres remain in a tight race for their division title.</p>

The victims were on an overcrowded boat and were likely crushed, according to the Prefect of Pas-de-Calais, who blamed smuggling gangs for the tragedy. This incident adds to the growing number of fatalities in the Channel this year, with over 20 people having lost their lives. The event highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the extreme dangers migrants face in these crossings.</p>

          <p>A recently released "birthday book" for Jeffrey Epstein from 2003, containing a controversial note purportedly from Donald Trump, has intensified public and political scrutiny of the former president's past association with the convicted sex offender. This article suggests that unlike previous scandals, the tangible and troubling nature of the evidence makes it harder for Trump to dismiss, creating a vulnerability with both his base and the wider electorate. The book's contents, filled with lewd jokes and messages from powerful figures, fuel a broader narrative about the powerful elite's indifference to Epstein's crimes, keeping the story in the public consciousness.</p>

          <p>Despite a severe housing shortage in the United States, the existence of nearly 15 million vacant homes does not offer a straightforward solution. This article explains that the term "vacant" covers a wide range of situations, including homes for rent, seasonal vacation properties, and houses undergoing repairs, which are part of a normal housing market churn. While programs in cities like Detroit and Baltimore are working to reclaim derelict properties, these efforts are geographically limited and cannot address affordability issues in high-demand areas. The analysis concludes that solving the crisis requires building more new homes, not just repurposing existing ones.</p>

Martinelli, who thrives in open space, has struggled to create decisive moments, leading to discussions about his future at the club amidst new, expensive signings.

          <p>A Guardian investigation based on leaked flight records reveals that the Trump administration is moving immigrant detainees around the U.S. in unprecedented and chaotic ways, effectively denying them due process. The data shows thousands of individuals, including hundreds of children, being subjected to long, multi-stop flights to undisclosed locations far from their legal counsel and families. This frequent shuffling, which has increased significantly in recent months, creates a state of "purgatory" for detainees. Attorneys and advocates argue the practice is a deliberate strategy to make the system as cruel as possible and coerce people into accepting voluntary deportation.</p>

Residents and civil liberties experts report widespread racial profiling and arrests for low-level offenses, with federal agents using tactics the local police typically avoid. While the administration claims the move was necessary to combat violent crime, critics argue it has been an overbearing and unconstitutional occupation that primarily targeted minority communities. The operation has led to over 2,100 arrests, but many cases have been for minor infractions, and judges have pushed back against the tactics used.</p>

Health policy experts warn this "subsidy cliff" would reverse recent gains in health coverage and could leave over 4 million people uninsured.

Traore has pivoted the country away from its former colonial partner, France, and aligned with other military-led regimes in the Sahel and Russia. Despite his promises, the security situation remains dire, with large parts of the country outside government control.</p>

          <p>Protesters took to the streets across France on Wednesday in a day of action aimed at disrupting the country and pressuring President Emmanuel Macron's government. The "Block Everything" movement, which organized online, led to blocked roads, fires, and clashes with police, resulting in nearly 200 arrests. The demonstrations coincided with the appointment of a new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, after his predecessor was ousted in a no-confidence vote. The movement has a wide range of grievances, primarily focused on austerity measures, contested budget plans, and broader social inequality.</p>

          <p>A German court has sentenced Syrian national Issa Al H. to life in prison for murdering three people and injuring ten others in a knife attack at a street festival in Solingen in August 2024. The court noted the particular severity of the crime and imposed preventive detention, making his future release unlikely. The perpetrator, a rejected asylum seeker, cited anger over children being killed in Gaza as his motive and was accused of being a member of the "Islamic State" terror group. The case has intensified Germany's political debate over asylum policies, internal security, and Islamist extremism.</p>

He cited Chinese-funded roads, an airport, and an expressway as key projects that have positively impacted the Cambodian people.

While university leaders insist the move is a strategic merger and not a takeover, the University and College Union has raised concerns about likely redundancies, arguing the merger is a response to Kent's near-insolvency.</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Transportation Safety Board has revealed harrowing details about a Delta flight that encountered severe turbulence over Wyoming in July. Unbuckled passengers were violently thrown against the ceiling as the plane flew through a thunderstorm, experiencing gravitational forces up to 1.75 times their body weight. The incident, which lasted for 2.5 minutes, resulted in 24 people being evaluated by paramedics and two crew members sustaining serious injuries. The investigation will examine why the seatbelt sign was off and whether the pilots could have better avoided the storm cell.</p>

          <p>President Trump dined at a seafood restaurant in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, an outing he used to promote his federal crackdown on crime in the capital. His appearance drew a mixed reaction, with cheers from some onlookers but also chants from a small group inside the restaurant protesting U.S. policy regarding Gaza. After a brief, tense standoff, Secret Service agents removed the protesters from the establishment. The event was notable as the president rarely dines out in the city, and it highlighted the polarized public response to his administration's increased law enforcement and military presence in D.C.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author recounts the alarming experience of discovering that a bat found in their backyard, which had been near their dog, tested positive for rabies. The incident transformed a once-anachronistic fear into a modern-day reality, underscoring the critical role of vaccinations in preventing a fatal disease. The author describes the reassuring and efficient response from veterinarians and public health officials, which contrasted sharply with the potential horror of the disease itself. The experience serves as a powerful, firsthand argument against vaccine complacency, highlighting how scientific progress has protected generations from once-common threats.</p>

The subsequent use of LAPD officers drew criticism, which the police union amplified with a statement calling Harris a "failed presidential candidate."

A series of federal actions, including proposed legislation and directives from the Department of Health and Human Services, aims to compel states to allow religious or personal belief exemptions. These moves, combined with legal challenges seeking to establish a right to religious exemptions, threaten to undermine a law credited with significantly boosting vaccination rates in California.

Pritzker alleges that Trump's goal is to normalize military intervention in U.S. cities to set a precedent he could use to influence the 2026 congressional elections. While the president lacks the authority to send troops without the governor's request, the Department of Homeland Security has already launched a separate immigration enforcement operation in the city.
