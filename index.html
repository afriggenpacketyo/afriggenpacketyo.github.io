          <p>Linwood Riddick, a Vietnam War veteran, graduated from South Carolina State University at the age of 79, fulfilling a long-held ambition inspired by the Orangeburg Massacre of 1968. After retiring from his souvenir business at 72, Riddick enrolled at SC State to honor the students who sacrificed their lives protesting segregation. During the commencement ceremony, Riddick was recognized by the university president for his dedication, as he drove an hour each day to attend classes. He hopes his achievement will inspire others to pursue their dreams regardless of age, demonstrating that it is never too late to learn and grow.</p>

          <p>Margot FriedlÃ¤nder, a Holocaust survivor who spent over six decades in New York City, passed away in Berlin at the age of 103, after returning to Germany in 2010 to share her experiences and promote tolerance. FriedlÃ¤nder, who became a symbol of Holocaust remembrance, only began speaking about her experiences after her husband's death, eventually publishing a memoir and featuring in a documentary. She dedicated her later years to educating young people about the Holocaust, receiving numerous accolades and even appearing on the cover of German Vogue.

          <p>Ukraine and its allies are advocating for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, commencing on Monday, as leaders from major European countries visited Kyiv to promote peace talks. This follows a phone call between the leaders, U.S. President Trump, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, as well as the end of a unilateral ceasefire declared by Russia, which Ukraine claims was violated. While Trump has urged both sides to reach an agreement, Russia has not yet agreed to the proposed ceasefire, and Ukraine's European allies view the conflict as crucial to the continent's security. The leaders are also discussing a "coalition of the willing" to support Ukraine's armed forces post-peace deal.</p>

While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that the two sides are engaging in discussions has raised hopes for a potential reduction in tensions.

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with her death, thanks to advancements in fingerprint technology. Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. A thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the scene was recently matched to Sims through an upgraded F.B.I. database algorithm. Sims, who had a prior conviction for assault and robbery, was extradited from Ohio, and his DNA matched evidence found on Ralston's body.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, 81, was convicted of 23 felony counts of financial fraud after offering the victim bogus investment opportunities with promised 10% interest. Prosecutors revealed that Cohen-Roth was running a Ponzi scheme, using funds from new investors to pay off earlier ones and support a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute as a result of the scheme.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan announced a cease-fire on Saturday after days of escalating conflict, but reports of continued violence emerged shortly after, with both sides accusing each other of violating the truce. President Trump announced the cease-fire, citing U.S. mediation, which India disputed. The conflict began after 26 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Kashmir, with India blaming Pakistan for involvement, a claim Pakistan denies. Despite the cease-fire agreement, cross-border firing was reported, and questions remain about the effectiveness and stability of the truce.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease considering the economic damage caused by climate change when developing policies and regulations, effectively shelving the "social cost of carbon" metric. This metric, used for over two decades, estimates the economic impact of global warming, such as wildfires and droughts, to weigh the costs and benefits of regulations limiting carbon pollution. Acting administrator Jeffrey B. Clark cited "uncertainties" in calculating the figure and questioned the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, drawing criticism from scientists and environmental groups who argue the move denies reality and ignores the economic consequences of climate change.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the outcome of talks among Ukraine's allies in Kyiv as a "significant moment" in efforts to secure a ceasefire with Russia, while acknowledging it's not "the end of the process." Around 30 global leaders reaffirmed their call for Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, threatening further sanctions if the demand isn't met. In a phone call following the meeting, President Trump reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire. The Kremlin reacted by accusing European leaders of making "contradictory" remarks, but later stated Russia would consider the proposal.</p>

Senator Jeff Merkley criticized Trump's $TRUMP meme coin and other crypto ventures, arguing they create opportunities for individuals to enrich the president for influence. The GENIUS Act, aimed at establishing federal rules for stablecoins, failed to advance in the Senate, highlighting the challenges Trump faces in passing legislation due to his financial entanglements.

          <p>Economists are questioning whether Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will earn President Trump's "Too Late" label, with concerns the Fed is being too cautious amidst volatile economic conditions. Despite Trump's urging for rate cuts, the Fed has held steady, citing a "solid" economy and a strong labor market. However, some economists believe the Fed's reliance on lagging indicators like the labor market may lead to delayed action, potentially triggering a recession. The Fed's history of being slow to respond to economic shifts further fuels these concerns, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies.</p>
