          <p>Officials in Kent, UK, have ordered the removal of all transgender-related books from the children's sections of its 99 libraries. The move, announced by council leader Linden Kemkaran and communities portfolio holder Paul Webb of Reform UK, was prompted by a public complaint about an adult-oriented transgender book being in a general display area. Critics, including local MPs and LGBTQ+ advocates, have condemned the decision as censorship that creates an unsafe and unwelcoming environment for transgender youth, arguing it will negatively impact their mental health and sense of belonging.</p>

          <p>Following the congressional passage of President Trump's major domestic policy package, both Republican and Democratic parties have launched campaigns to control the public narrative ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans are highlighting the bill's significant tax cuts, including the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, framing it as a win for working families. Conversely, Democrats are focusing on the legislation's cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, which they argue will harm millions to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Public polling currently indicates that the bill is largely unpopular with a majority of Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Partey, a 32-year-old Ghanaian international and former Arsenal footballer, has been charged with five counts of sexual assault against two women and an additional count of sexual assault involving a third woman. The alleged offenses occurred between 2021 and 2022, with the investigation beginning in February 2022. Partey, whose contract with Arsenal recently ended, denies all charges and, according to his lawyer, welcomes the opportunity to clear his name in court. He is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in early August to face the allegations.</p>

          <p>Ismail Abdo, the 35-year-old leader of Sweden's Rumba crime organization and one of the country's most wanted criminals, has been arrested in Turkey. Abdo is accused of orchestrating drug trafficking and a wave of violent crime in Sweden from abroad, contributing to the nation's struggle with gang-related shootings and bombings. His arrest is the result of long-term cooperation between Turkish and Swedish authorities. The Rumba gang has been engaged in a violent feud with the rival Foxtrot network, which was linked to the murder of Abdo's mother in 2023.</p>

Bukele responded on social media with photos and videos purporting to show Ábrego García in good condition, questioning the torture narrative. The case is further complicated by a gag order from a U.S. judge in Ábrego García's separate human-smuggling case, aimed at preventing prejudicial public statements from either side.</p>

The case went cold for years until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through advanced DNA testing.

          <p>Amid a feud with President Trump, Elon Musk has renewed his suggestion of creating a new political party, tentatively named the "America Party." However, establishing a third party in the United States is a formidable challenge, even for a billionaire. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often designed to favor the existing two-party system and require extensive signature gathering and litigation. Experts note that while Musk's wealth could fund such an effort, building a nationally recognized party would be a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project, making it an unlikely factor in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Expert States Beijing Seeks Clarity on Taiwan for Potential Trump Summit</h2>

          <p>A leading Chinese academic has stated that for a potential summit between President Trump and Chinese leadership to be successful, the U.S. must first clarify its position on Taiwan. Wu Xinbo, dean at Fudan University, asserted that Trump should explicitly state that the U.S. does not support Taiwan's independence, a position he claims is consistent with past U.S. presidents. This demand for clarity comes after the U.S. State Department recently removed a phrase from its website stating non-support for Taiwanese independence. Beijing views the self-governed island as a rogue province to be reunified, by force if necessary.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has outlined five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong cardiovascular health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes and deep-fried foods cooked in industrial oils. Instead, he recommends wholesome alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean, unprocessed proteins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether to pay for professional movers involves weighing cost against convenience, and financial experts suggest asking several key questions first. Homeowners should consider if they own valuable or fragile items that would be expensive to replace if damaged during a self-move. It's also important to calculate the value of time saved by outsourcing the labor, and whether the expense will protect one's peace of mind and prevent work-related disruptions. Ultimately, the decision should not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to taking on high-interest debt to cover the cost.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Germany are spearheading a proposal to create an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which they argue is no longer effective. The initiative, floated by Ursula von der Leyen and Friedrich Merz, aims to establish a new body with like-minded nations, potentially starting with the CPTPP trade bloc, to uphold rules-based trade and resolve disputes. This move is a direct response to the paralysis of the WTO's appellate body, which has been blocked by successive U.S. administrations. The goal is to create an alliance that can address modern trade challenges like US protectionism and Chinese market distortions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology suggests that what is considered "cool" is remarkably consistent across different countries. Researchers found that people perceived as cool tend to share six specific personality traits: they are seen as more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous. The study, involving nearly 6,000 participants from a dozen nations, distinguished these traits from those associated with being a "good" person, such as conscientiousness and agreeableness. This suggests that coolness is tied to boundary-pushing and a desire for change, rather than purely moral or conventional qualities.</p>

          <p>A 90-day pause on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, raising concerns about a potential surge in import duties that could fuel inflation and harm businesses. The Trump administration has been working to secure bilateral trade agreements to avert the hikes, announcing deals with China and the U.K., but the status of pacts with many other nations remains uncertain. If new deals are not reached, country-specific tariffs would be added to the existing 10% baseline duty, significantly increasing costs on billions in imports. Experts believe some extensions are likely, but the prolonged uncertainty is already chilling business investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a collection of eight unusually large, 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. One of the leather shoes measures nearly 13 inches long, equivalent to a modern US size 15. The finds are puzzling because such large sizes are rare in the vast collection from the nearby Vindolanda fort, yet they represent a significant portion of the shoes found at Magna. Researchers are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at the site to understand who these large-footed individuals might have been.</p>

          <p>Two brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad, are on trial for allegedly assaulting three police officers during a violent brawl at Manchester Airport in July of last year. The prosecution claims the incident began after Mr. Amaaz headbutted and punched another man in a Starbucks cafe within the terminal. When armed police attempted to arrest him in a car park area, the brothers allegedly resisted and assaulted the officers, with one officer suffering a broken nose. The defendants claim they were acting in self-defense, but the prosecution asserts that CCTV footage clearly shows their unlawful conduct.</p>

          <p>In Springfield, Ohio, community volunteers are urgently working to help Haitian families obtain U.S. passports for their American-born children. This effort comes as the Trump administration moves to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, which could lead to their deportation and potentially separate them from their children. Without passports, these U.S. citizen children could become stateless or be placed in foster care if their parents are forced to leave the country. The dire security situation in Haiti makes returning unsafe, amplifying the fear and desperation within the community.</p>
