          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the inspector general to review a controversial $2.5 billion renovation of its Washington, D.C. buildings. The project has faced sharp criticism from the Trump administration, with officials calling it an example of "fundamental mismanagement" and "excess spending." The Fed, which is not taxpayer-funded, defends the project as necessary for safety remediation, including asbestos removal, and to bring the buildings up to modern code after decades without comprehensive updates.

          <p>Starbucks has announced that its corporate employees must return to the office four days a week starting in October. In a letter to employees, CEO Brian Niccol stated that the company will offer a "one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment" for those who do not wish to comply. This move is part of a broader strategy to reverse slumping sales, which has also included menu simplification and job cuts to streamline operations.

Three men in their twenties have been arrested in connection with the murder, which occurred last week on Seville Street. While police are keeping an open mind about the motive, the possibility of a targeted incident has led to increased police patrols in the area to reassure the public while the complex investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Authorities have announced that NFL legend John Elway will not be charged in the death of his business partner, Jeffrey Sperbeck, who fatally fell from a golf cart Elway was driving in April. The Riverside County Sheriff's Department ruled the incident a tragic accident, stating that after reviewing video footage, there was no criminal explanation for why Sperbeck fell. The coroner's report confirmed the cause of death was blunt force trauma from the fall, closing the investigation.</p>

          <p>An article from The Economist questions whether the long-held advantage of affordable housing in politically red states is diminishing. For years, Americans have migrated from blue states to red states, a trend often attributed by politicians like Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis to a better quality of life and lower costs. However, this analysis suggests that the very popularity driving this migration may be eroding the price advantages that made these states attractive in the first place. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has offered a novel explanation for why President Trump's tariffs have not caused widespread inflation, suggesting it is due to a surge in "patriotism." Speaking on CNBC, Hassett theorized that Americans are choosing to buy domestic products, which has driven down demand for imports so significantly that it has offset any price increases from the tariffs. This argument contrasts with the views of many economists who cite other factors for the muted price effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, the joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, announced it will upgrade its Spring Hill, Tennessee, facility to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries.
