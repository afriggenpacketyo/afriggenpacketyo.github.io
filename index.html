          <p>Strategy's bitcoin treasury strategy, which boosted its market capitalization, is now being adopted by various companies, including meme stock firms and media organizations. Trump Media announced plans to acquire bitcoin, and GameStop revealed a significant allocation to the cryptocurrency. The Biden administration previously treated corporate bitcoin adoption with caution, but the Trump administration has shifted its stance by establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The reserve will be funded through bitcoin seized in criminal cases, and the government will conduct a full audit of its digital asset holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, was found to have a second tumor on her spine during an MRI.

The procedure involved removing part of her cheekbone and eye socket to reach the tumor, which was then successfully removed.

          <p>An analysis of the Mission: Impossible film franchise argues that its early installments, defined by their lack of continuity and distinct directorial styles, offer a compelling contrast to today's rigid brand-building pressures in big-budget filmmaking. The first four films, directed by Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird, showcased unique creative visions and tones, emphasizing the adaptability of the franchise. In contrast, later films, including Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning, suffer from attempting to connect disparate story threads and establish a stricter canon, sacrificing the singularity and creative sensibilities of the earlier entries.</p>
