        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a strong backlash against the Trump administration's escalated immigration enforcement, which includes deploying the National Guard. The administration's actions involve ICE agents conducting raids without judicial warrants, leading to the detention of families and separation of children from parents, practices condemned by activists. Protests erupted after federal agents targeted workplaces, resulting in clashes with law enforcement and the arrest of union leaders, drawing widespread anger and condemnation. Trump's response included activating the National Guard, bypassing the governor, and labeling protesters as "insurrectionists," while community leaders and politicians denounce the raids as terrorizing and an attack on the community. </p>

          <p>Two Russian human rights experts, having fled Russia's authoritarian regime, observe worrying parallels in the United States. They highlight the lack of appropriate language among Americans to describe these trends, drawing on a rich Russian vocabulary developed over decades of facing dictators. They offer a "phrase book" of authoritarian terms to help Americans understand and combat what they see as an emerging authoritarian reality, such as the term "mnogohodovochka," which mocks the Kremlin's need to explain Putin's actions as part of a brilliant long-term plan, even when nonsensical. The experts urge Americans to name and understand the situation to effectively resist it. </p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 34.5% in May, marking the steepest decline in over five years, while imports from the U.S. also fell by over 18%. This decline is attributed to the lingering effects of prohibitive tariffs imposed during trade negotiations. Overall exports rose 4.8%, but imports plunged 3.4% due to weak domestic demand, though shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa increased. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is expected to meet with U.S. trade representatives in London for renewed trade talks after accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement.

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles against immigration enforcement operations have escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, resulting in property damage and arrests. President Trump deployed the National Guard in response to the unrest, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as inflammatory. The LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell cited restrictions from the California Values Act, which limits local law enforcement's involvement in federal immigration enforcement. Protesters vandalized vehicles, blocked freeways, and clashed with authorities, prompting the declaration of an unlawful assembly in downtown Los Angeles, with Representative Maxine Waters condemning Trump's deployment as a disruption. </p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures amid weak domestic demand and price wars in the automotive industry.

Despite these challenges, core inflation rose 0.6%, the highest since January, while Chinese policymakers have urged the automotive industry to halt price wars.

          <p>The Trump administration's new travel ban, restricting citizens from a dozen countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, has gone into effect. Unlike the 2017 ban, this proclamation targets a broader range of countries, including Haiti and Venezuela, and imposes varying levels of restrictions. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory, disproportionately affecting non-white countries and undermining opportunities for education and professional development. The ban does not revoke previously issued visas but will reject new applications unless they meet specific exemption criteria, raising concerns about division and xenophobia. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's ambitious $80 billion coal-power expansion is increasingly threatened by water scarcity, as most new projects are planned for water-stressed areas. Despite investments in renewable energy, coal remains a dominant resource, leading to competition for limited water resources between industry and residents. In Solapur, a 1,320-megawatt coal-fired plant has strained water availability for local communities, highlighting the challenges of balancing energy needs with environmental concerns. The power ministry acknowledges that plant locations are determined by land and water access, with state governments responsible for water allocation. </p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles as an overreach of power. The board argues that local law enforcement had the protests under control, and Governor Newsom opposed the deployment, deeming it inflammatory. The editorial highlights the historical context of presidential authority over the National Guard, noting Trump's invocation of a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, and contrasts it with Trump's supporters' actions at the U.S. Capitol in 2021. The board suggests that Trump's actions are creating the chaos they are supposedly designed to prevent. </p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand its ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing practice, to cover a larger area of English waters. This expansion would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 across 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas. The proposal aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasizing the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans.

The vote follows a bitter pay dispute that saw nurses striking in 2022 and 2023, with the RCN arguing that nursing staff have faced over a decade of pay erosion.
