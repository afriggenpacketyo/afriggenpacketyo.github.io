          <h2>Trump Suggests Lowering China Tariffs to 80% Ahead of Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 09:18:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to 80% before trade talks in Switzerland, a significant drop from the current 145% but still potentially prohibitive to trade. This move signals a possible shift in Trump's stance, as he previously stated he wouldn't lower tariffs to initiate negotiations. The talks aim to achieve stability and lay a foundation for future agreements, with recent data showing a decline in goods moving from China to the U.S., raising concerns about price increases and shortages.</p>

          <p>David Souter, a retired Supreme Court Justice, passed away at the age of 85, remembered for his steady presence on the court's liberal wing despite being appointed by a Republican president. Souter's appointment by George H.W. Bush in 1990 was initially seen as a conservative victory, but he often sided with liberal justices on key issues like abortion rights and affirmative action. He retired in 2009, allowing Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor, and continued to serve on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for over a decade.

          <p>While Chinese citizens celebrated the reported combat success of the J-10C fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict, Beijing has remained cautious due to geopolitical considerations. Pakistan claimed to have shot down Indian Rafale fighter jets using the Chinese-made J-10C, marking the jet's first combat success. The Chinese government and official media have largely remained quiet, urging both sides to exercise restraint. This restraint is partly due to diplomatic considerations over a conflict between China's neighbor, India, and its ally, Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to earn high returns and lock in rates, providing a safe investment option with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Current national average CD rates vary by term, with 1-year CDs yielding around 2.01% APY and 5-year CDs yielding around 1.70% APY. However, top-yielding CDs, particularly from online banks, offer significantly higher rates. Strategies for securing good rates include exploring online banks and considering short-term CDs, as the inverted yield curve means shorter terms often have higher interest rates.</p>
