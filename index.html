          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal messaging app during a Cabinet meeting, a day before his removal. The article details how Waltz's use of Signal, particularly within group chats involving other national security officials, led to scrutiny and internal investigations. Despite the White House's defense of Signal as an approved app, the Pentagon's watchdog criticized its use for sensitive information, raising concerns about records retention and unauthorized communication. Trump ultimately nominated Waltz as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as interim national security advisor.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and constitutional rights violations.

The defense also seeks to suppress statements Mangione made to authorities in Pennsylvania, claiming he was not provided with Miranda warnings. The case has garnered significant attention due to the high-profile nature of the victim and the legal battle between state and federal prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, already serving as Secretary of State and acting administrator of USAID, has been appointed interim National Security Advisor, raising concerns about his capacity to effectively manage all responsibilities.

          <p>President Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, which will likely raise prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. The article explains that the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed parcels worth less than $800 to enter the US without duties, is being eliminated to combat the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and protect American businesses. This move aligns with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China, with some Chinese imports facing taxes of up to 145%. The UK and EU may also follow suit, potentially leading to price increases for consumers worldwide.</p>

          <p>A 400-page report from the Department of Health and Human Services questions the current approach to health care for transgender children. The article details that the report, commissioned under an executive order entitled "Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," describes gender-affirming care as fundamentally misguided. The report's authors conclude that doctors and clinics providing such care have "fallen short of their duty to prioritize the health interests of young patients." This stance aligns with President Trump's previous actions and rhetoric against transgender rights, sparking concern among medical professionals and advocacy groups.</p>
