          <p>More than 50 Palestinians were reportedly killed and hundreds injured near a crossing in northern Gaza while waiting for food supplies. Gaza's Civil Defence agency stated that Israeli forces fired on the crowd, a claim the Israeli military disputes, stating they only fired warning shots and are unaware of casualties from their fire. The incident occurs as a US special envoy visits Israel amid stalled ceasefire talks and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning of famine conditions. The ongoing conflict and aid distribution challenges have led to immense suffering and multiple deadly incidents involving desperate crowds and security forces.</p>

          <p>A new report has found that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) failed to listen to a mother's concerns before the death of her five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir. Yusuf died from a lung infection just days after being sent home from a hospital emergency department with antibiotics. The investigation concluded that healthcare providers relied too heavily on clinical metrics over the family's insights, leading to a lack of shared decision-making and reduced trust. The family is now calling for a formal inquest and demanding accountability to ensure that lessons are learned and future tragedies are prevented.</p>

          <p>An air traffic control issue caused significant disruption across all UK airports, leading to numerous flight cancellations and delays. NATS, the UK's national air traffic provider, apologized for the radar-related problem, which was resolved within an hour by switching to a backup system. Despite systems returning to normal, travel experts warn that the knock-on effects could last for days during the busy summer holiday season as airlines work to clear the backlog. Airlines have expressed frustration over the repeated failures, with some calling for the resignation of the NATS chief executive.</p>

          <p>Shares for Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, dropped significantly after the company announced a 1.9% decline in second-quarter sales volumes, which was worse than analysts had predicted. The decrease was primarily driven by underperformance in China and weaker demand in Brazil, attributed to adverse weather and challenging comparisons. Despite the volume drop, the maker of Budweiser and Corona reported a 6.5% rise in operating profit, as increased prices offset the lower sales. Analysts suggest the substantial volume miss is likely to negatively impact the stock, overshadowing the strong profit growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 43 British peers, including prominent lawyers, has warned the UK government that recognizing a Palestinian state could violate international law. They argue in a letter that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria outlined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. The warning follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets conditions like agreeing to a ceasefire. A government minister defended the plan, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 UN members already recognize Palestine.</p>

Hathaleen, who worked on the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," was shot and killed in the West Bank on Monday. The incident has drawn criticism from a Democratic congressman, who stated that lifting such sanctions emboldens violent actors and undermines accountability.</p>

          <p>Qatar has threatened to stop liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments to Europe over a dispute concerning a new EU directive on corporate sustainability and due diligence. The law requires large firms to address human rights and environmental issues in their supply chains, with potential fines up to 5% of global turnover for non-compliance. Qatari officials argue the directive's climate rules exceed the Paris Agreement's scope and pose a significant risk to state-owned QatarEnergy. As Europe has grown more reliant on Qatari LNG since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, any disruption could trigger another surge in energy prices.</p>

          <p>Cambodia has called on Thailand to release 20 of its soldiers who were captured hours after a ceasefire was declared, intended to halt deadly border clashes. The truce, which appears to be holding, followed five days of fighting that killed at least 43 people and was brokered after pressure from the United States. The Thai government stated the detained soldiers are being treated humanely and will be returned once the border situation stabilizes. The conflict stems from a long-standing dispute over ancient temples along the shared border, with both nations now navigating a fragile peace.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News argues that President Donald Trump has successfully weakened established liberal media outlets. The author cites recent developments such as the defunding of NPR and PBS, the departure of Stephen Colbert from late-night television, and staff buyouts at The Washington Post as evidence of Trump's victory over his media adversaries. The piece contends that unlike previous Republican presidents, Trump has been willing to directly confront and fight back against what he perceives as biased coverage.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court is set to hear arguments regarding the legality of President Donald Trump's unilaterally imposed "reciprocal" tariffs. The lawsuit, brought by a coalition of states and small businesses, challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the tariffs, arguing he overstepped his authority by bypassing Congress. No previous president has used the IEEPA in this manner. The court's decision could significantly impact Washington's trade negotiations and the administration's ability to enforce tariffs on imports from key partners like China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

The project aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data to be processed on European soil, and aims to address the continent's shortage of large-scale computing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian aerial attack on Kyiv has killed at least six people, including a child, and wounded over 50 others. Ukrainian officials reported that a barrage of 309 drones and cruise missiles struck several districts, causing one apartment building entrance to collapse entirely. The attack occurred despite threats from US President Donald Trump to impose tougher sanctions if Russia does not agree to a ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the attack demonstrates that "peace without strength is impossible," while his foreign minister called for maximum pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have struck a trade agreement that includes a partnership to develop Pakistan's oil reserves and will result in lower tariffs on its exports to the US. The deal was announced by US President Donald Trump, who said an American oil company would be chosen to lead the development effort. This agreement averts a potential 29% tariff that Pakistan was facing from the US. The development comes as Washington imposes a 25% tariff on India, with Trump criticizing India's own high tariffs and its trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned comments made by Spain's transport minister, Oscar Puente, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers as "Israeli kids." The teens were removed from a Vueling flight in Valencia, with the airline citing disruptive behavior and tampering with safety equipment, a claim the group's organizer denies. In a now-deleted social media post, Puente appeared to use the term to criticize his political opponents. French ministers called the comment unacceptable and discriminatory, and also criticized the alleged use of excessive force by Spanish police against one of the group's counselors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent trade deal between the European Union and the United States is a moment of profound humiliation for the EU, akin to Britain's Suez crisis in 1956. The author contends that the EU made all the concessions, agreeing to a 15% tariff on most of its exports to the US while eliminating its own tariffs on US goods and committing to massive investments and energy purchases. The article suggests this lopsided agreement demonstrates the EU's subservience to US pressure and the failure of its long-term goal to match American geopolitical influence. It concludes that the EU has been relegated to a secondary power, while China is now the only serious rival to US hegemony.</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia and the new airline Air Borneo, are expressing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet. According to Malaysia's transport minister, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery backlogs from Airbus and Boeing, is driving this interest. China is actively promoting its Comac-built aircraft as a more readily available and cheaper alternative to the dominant Western manufacturers. This move reflects a broader trend of airlines in the region seeking to diversify their fleets and secure aircraft more quickly.</p>

          <p>Australia's plan for a national ban on social media for users under 16 is generating debate over its potential to address youth mental health issues. The government argues the ban is a necessary response to a crisis fueled by platforms like TikTok and Instagram, but some experts are skeptical. Critics point to a lack of research proving a direct causal link between social media use and poor mental health, suggesting the ban is an overly simple solution to a complex problem. They also note that social media can provide valuable community for some young people and that prohibition may not be the best way to prepare them for a technologically saturated world.</p>

The Piprahwa Gems, unearthed in 1898, were scheduled for auction but the sale was canceled after diplomatic intervention. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics, facilitating their return for permanent public display in India. The planned auction had sparked a significant ethical debate over whether sacred objects, particularly those associated with human remains, should be treated as commercial commodities.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's August 1 tariff deadline nears, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the global trade landscape. The US has secured framework deals with partners like the EU, UK, Japan, and South Korea, generally establishing tariffs of 10-15% in exchange for significant investment and purchasing commitments. However, many other nations face the prospect of much higher levies. Countries like India, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada are threatened with steep tariffs of 25-50% amid political and economic disputes. Meanwhile, complex negotiations with China continue, highlighting the administration's aggressive and often unpredictable approach to trade policy.</p>

He suggested the party should learn from US President Donald Trump's strategy of acting fast with a clear plan, even if some policies are not immediately popular.
