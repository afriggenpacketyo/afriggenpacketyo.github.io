          <p>Former Yomiuri Giant and New York Yankee Hideki Matsui paid his respects to his former manager, Shigeo Nagashima, following Nagashima's death. Matsui credited Nagashima for shaping his baseball career, recalling the impact Nagashima had on him since drafting him in 1992. Matsui, who flew from the United States to Japan for the visit, spent over two hours at Nagashima's home, reminiscing about their shared memories. Nagashima, a charismatic figure, led the Yomiuri Giants to numerous championships and was highly regarded in Japanese baseball, with Matsui also winning multiple titles under his guidance.</p>

          <p>Fran Kirby, a celebrated midfielder, has retired from her England career due to persistent injuries and health issues.

          <p>European industries are warning of potential shutdowns due to Chinese government restrictions on the export of rare earth elements. These restrictions, perceived as retaliation against US tariffs, are affecting European companies reliant on these minerals for manufacturing smartphones and electric vehicles. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China reports that Beijing is overwhelmed with export applications, leading to delays and production halts for some companies. Rare earths, consisting of 17 elements, are vital for many high-tech goods, and the restrictions are causing significant concern within the European business community.</p>

          <p>In 2024, Japan's number of births fell below 700,000 for the first time, marking a 5.7% decrease from the previous year, highlighting a continued trend of delayed marriages and childbirths. The total fertility rate also declined to a record low of 1.15. While the number of marriages increased slightly, the number of deaths reached a postwar high, resulting in a record natural population decrease. The birthrate has been declining since its peak in 1973, and current trends are outpacing previous projections, with Tokyo recording the lowest fertility rate and Okinawa having the highest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue that these protections could harm steel producers outside the US, provoke retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American consumers. The UK has been granted an exemption from the increased duties, maintaining a 25% tariff due to ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists predict that the tariffs will lead to job losses in sectors reliant on steel and aluminum, despite potentially creating jobs within the steel industry itself.</p>

          <p>BBC research reveals that only 1% of domestic abuse-related death reviews are completed within the recommended six-month timeframe, causing additional distress for bereaved families. These reviews, now called domestic abuse-related death reviews (DARDR), aim to identify missed opportunities to prevent killings by partners or family members. Families report that the lengthy review process is "hell on earth," and delays hinder the prevention of future deaths. The government is creating a new oversight board to expedite the review process, acknowledging the need for more timely and effective investigations.</p>

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone attack on Russian military airfields and assets has highlighted the increasing importance of asymmetric warfare and the vulnerabilities of even the most advanced militaries. The attack, dubbed Operation Spider’s Web, involved smuggling explosive-laden drones into Russia and using them to damage or destroy strategic bombers. This operation demonstrates how inexpensive, readily available technology can inflict significant damage on a well-equipped adversary. The success of this mission could inspire similar attacks and reshape modern warfare strategies.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's endorsement of Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel, workers remain wary, citing concerns about job security and the potential impact on their plants. Trump's claims that the deal would create tens of thousands of jobs are met with skepticism, as veterans of the steel industry distrust his rhetoric and promises. The United Steel Workers (USW) union has noted Nippon Steel's history of violating US trade laws. Workers emphasize the importance of binding commitments to protect their interests.</p>

          <p>China's significant investment in science is proving fruitful, particularly as the U.S. has threatened to restrict international students.

This shift in the global landscape has allowed China to attract talented scientists, potentially impacting the future of scientific research and development.

          <p>A decision to ban the question of Palestinian statehood from school elections in Denmark has sparked controversy, with critics arguing it contradicts the country's tradition of freedom of expression. The governing parties claim the issue is too explosive for classroom discussions and could make minority students uncomfortable. However, the decision is seen as an attempt to avoid addressing the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Denmark's role in it. The government's actions expose a double standard, as it readily supports Ukraine but remains complicit in the suffering of Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists have been charged with smuggling a toxic fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the United States, which they allegedly planned to research at an American university. The justice department said the pair conspired to smuggle the fungus that causes "head blight," a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, into the United States. The fungus is classified in scientific literature as a “potential agroterrorism weapon,” the FBI said, and causes billions of dollars in losses each year. US Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr described the smuggling of the fungus into the United States as a “national security” concern.</p>
