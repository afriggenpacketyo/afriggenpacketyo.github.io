          <p>India announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" following a militant attack in Pahalgam. The operation, labeled "Operation Sindoor," targeted nine sites, with the Indian Ministry of Defence stating that the actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, and that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed a strong response, while international figures like U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called for de-escalation. Most airlines are diverting out of Pakistani airspace and airports in northern India have been impacted by the strikes, with the situation being closely monitored by the international community.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is facing significant delays and cancellations due to an air traffic controller shortage and equipment failures. The union representing air traffic controllers says that multiple members are on trauma leave after losing communication with pilots, which has exacerbated the existing staffing issues. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to announce an overhaul of the nation's aging air traffic control system, including new technology and hiring more controllers, but the FAA says Newark's airspace is safe despite the ongoing issues. Sen. Chuck Schumer is demanding an investigation from the Department of Transportation's inspector general, and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has requested federal support to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans after a five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education will work with the Department of Treasury to manage the student loan program, helping borrowers return to repayment to improve their financial health and the nation's economy. Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with an additional 4 million at risk, and the government will restart the Treasury Offset Program to collect income tax refunds and other federal payments. Borrowers in default should contact the Default Resolution Group for assistance, and those in danger of defaulting will receive notices from their loan servicers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to transport a group of immigrants to Libya on a U.S. military plane, sparking outrage from human rights groups due to the country's ongoing conflict and "horrific" conditions in migrant detention centers. The decision aligns with the administration's efforts to deter illegal immigration by sending a strong message about potential deportations to dangerous countries. The State Department warns against traveling to Libya due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict, while human rights organizations have documented abuses in Libyan detention facilities. This potential action follows similar controversial deportations to El Salvador and Panama.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson criticized the Indiana Pacers' physical play during their recent playoff game, suggesting it crossed a line and contributed to injuries for Evan Mobley and DeAndre Hunter. Atkinson emphasized that while the play wasn't "dirty," the excessive physicality led to Mobley aggravating an ankle injury and Hunter dislocating a thumb. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle defended his team, stating that coaches protect their players and that disagreements are common in heated playoff series. Mobley and Hunter were ruled out for Game 2 due to their injuries.</p>

This incident contributed to hundreds of delayed flights, and officials have acknowledged the antiquated air traffic control system, prompting calls for modernization.

          <p>Two Trump administration officials, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, will meet with their Chinese counterparts to discuss trade in the coming days, signaling a potential step toward resolving the ongoing tariff standoff. The meetings follow weeks of escalating tensions and reciprocal tariffs between the two countries. Bessent stated that initial discussions will likely focus on "de-escalation" rather than a comprehensive trade deal, acknowledging the unsustainable nature of the current tariff levels. Chinese officials have expressed openness to negotiating, but have also pushed for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

          <p>President Trump is planning to announce that the U.S. will now refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, aligning with the preferences of Arab nations. This decision comes as Trump is set to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The move is likely to be met with criticism from Iran, which maintains its historic ties to the Persian Gulf. The name of the body of water has become an emotive issue for Iranians who embrace their countryâ€™s long history as the Persian Empire.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a stark contrast to his previous hostile rhetoric towards Canada. Trump, who had spent months belittling Canada and suggesting its annexation, declared, "Canada loves us and we love Canada." The meeting, freighted with awkwardness and recrimination, saw Trump attempting to skate around the complications created by his previous statements, shifting the conversation to unrelated topics. Carney, however, remained guarded, making it clear that Canada was not open to any discussion of becoming the 51st state.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and singer Diljit Dosanjh, were met with disappointment by some South Asian fans who felt the stars were not given the respect they deserved. Vogue's livestream hosts appeared largely unaware of Shah Rukh Khan's global fame, and quickly cut away from Diljit Dosanjh's red carpet appearance. The incident sparked online criticism, with many expressing that such disrespect would not have been shown to other stars of similar stature. A Vogue representative stated that the lack of attention was unintentional.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to President Trump's tariffs, which have significantly increased the cost of importing bikes and bike parts.

Kent International has canceled new orders from China and does not plan to place new orders in May, as manufacturing and assembling bikes in the U.S. is not financially viable.</p>
