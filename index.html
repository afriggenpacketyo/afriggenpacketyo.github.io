          <p>This New York Times article examines the challenges Apple faces in shifting iPhone production to the United States, as previously demanded by President Trump, noting that doing so could double iPhone prices due to high labor costs and automation needs. The article highlights China's advantages, including a large, skilled workforce and established supply chains, making it difficult for the U.S. to compete. Apple has instead moved some production to India to avoid tariffs and tap into a growing smartphone market. Despite increasing production in India, Apple remains heavily reliant on China for key components.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that a record number of Americans applied for British citizenship in the first three months of this year, driven by concerns over the political climate in the United States. Immigration lawyers noted an increase in inquiries from Americans seeking to relocate to Britain following President Trump's re-election. The rise in applications is part of a broader global trend, but the increase from the U.S. significantly outpaces the global rate. Changes to settlement qualification periods are also motivating Americans to apply for permanent settlement sooner rather than later.</p>

          <p>Dining out with friends can be tricky when it comes to settling the bill, but an etiquette expert suggests communicating in advance to avoid awkward moments or conflicts. The most sophisticated approach involves informing the server upfront about separate checks or individual responsibility. If splitting the bill evenly, be mindful of others' consumption, especially regarding alcohol, and speak up if necessary. Setting expectations and avoiding dining with those known to 'gouge' on the bill are also recommended for a smoother experience.</p>

          <p>A new House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is expected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans while negatively impacting low-income households. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bottom 10% of households would see their income fall, while the top 10% would experience an income boost. The bill's tax cuts, which include breaks for business owners and investors, are partially offset by reductions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP.

          <p>Energy experts warn that the multitrillion-dollar GOP tax bill could significantly undermine decarbonization efforts in the U.S. The bill, passed by the House, includes cuts to clean energy credits and rolls back provisions from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Experts are concerned about the impact on clean energy projects and the potential loss of jobs in the renewable energy sector. The bill also contains provisions that would allow polluters to avoid oversight by paying a fee.</p>
