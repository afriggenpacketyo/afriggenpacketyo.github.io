            <p>In response to increased tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, China has announced its own tariffs on American imports. Trump's actions raised the cumulative import duties to 104% since he took office.

The Chinese government has also filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization and added US firms to its export-restriction and unreliable-entity lists.</p>

            <h2>Top US Companies Prioritized Buybacks Over Taxes After Trump Tax Cuts: Report</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A new report reveals that top US consumer goods corporations spent significantly more on share buybacks than on federal taxes after the 2017 Trump tax cuts. The analysis indicates that savings from the tax cuts were primarily used to enrich investors rather than lowering prices for consumers or raising workers' wages. Eleven companies, including PepsiCo and Comcast, collectively recorded nearly $500 billion in profits, enacted $463 billion in buybacks, and paid just $140 billion in federal taxes. The report suggests that the tax cuts incentivize buybacks, exacerbating wealth inequality. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Indian shrimp exporter Coastal Corp is adapting to the new tariffs imposed by the US by seeking to expand its exports to China, Russia, and Canada. The company reports that most of its US buyers are willing to absorb the higher costs stemming from the tariffs. While the US remains a significant buyer of Indian shrimp, the company aims to reduce its reliance on a single market by diversifying its export base. (not investment advice)</p>

            <h2>Trump's Trade Policy Driven by Misunderstanding of Bilateral Trade Deficits</h2>

            <p>Donald Trump's trade policy is driven by a belief that bilateral trade deficits indicate that the US is "losing" to other countries. This view, which is considered bizarre by many economists, is shaping his administration's approach to trade. Trump's tariffs are determined by the size of the trade deficit the US has with each country. Economists argue that this focus ignores the benefits of trade and the US advantage in service exports, leading to potentially damaging economic consequences.</p>

            <p>This article explains tariffs, their mechanics, and why President Trump is using them. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, and Trump aims to boost the US economy by encouraging consumers to buy American-made products. He argues that tariffs will reduce the trade deficit and lead to increased investment in the country. However, experts warn that tariffs could harm the world economy and raise prices for consumers. The article also explores the potential impact on stock markets and the UK.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court's ruling on immigration allows the Trump administration to continue deporting immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, provided they are given the right to challenge the government's claim. While hailed as a victory for both sides, experts say the ruling leaves many questions unanswered. Immigrant advocates express concern that the due process review will be difficult in practice, particularly for those detained far from their families and lawyers. The ruling has sparked debate about the constitutionality of using the wartime law and the fairness of the deportation process.</p>

            <p>Elderly and disabled individuals are facing significant service disruptions due to a sweeping overhaul of the Social Security Administration (SSA) system. The changes, enforced by Elon Musk's advisory team, include job cuts and office consolidations. Seniors are experiencing crashed webpages, jammed phone lines, and being turned away at offices. Advocacy groups have filed a lawsuit alleging that the changes are undermining services and causing harm to beneficiaries. Advocates say challenges accessing Social Security help were compounded in March when the Trump administration announced new online verification procedures that resulted in many elderly and disabled Americans being unable to use their personal “my Social Security” account.</p>
