          <p>President Trump held a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for high-paying customers of his $TRUMP memecoin, promising to promote the crypto industry from the White House. The event drew protesters who condemned it as corruption, while attendees admitted they sought to influence Trump and U.S. financial regulations. The dinner, organized by Trump's business partners, served as a fundraiser for the memecoin, a cryptocurrency tied to an online joke with no real function beyond speculation, but has become a vehicle for investors to funnel money to his family. The White House defended the event, rejecting claims of impropriety, while critics decried the event as an explicit effort to enrich the first family. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard face uncertainty after the Trump administration revoked the university’s authority to enroll them. The decision was made amid ongoing tensions between the administration and the university. This would affect over 6,800 students, more than a quarter of the total student body, and could transform the university. International students expressed fear and confusion, with many considering transferring to other universities. Some programs, particularly graduate programs, could be significantly impacted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is relying on an obscure bureaucratic lever to stop Harvard from enrolling international students, the latest in a series of aggressive moves. The government has revoked a certification that allows Harvard to have access to SEVIS, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. This is a significant escalation in the administration’s efforts to pressure Harvard to fall in line with the president’s agenda. Harvard could go to court to try to challenge its SEVIS termination.</p>

          <p>The CDC's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China. Cases have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area. The variant is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Preliminary data suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant has a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.</p>
