          <p>Filmmaker Colin Hanks has labeled past interview questions about comedian John Candy's weight as 'heartbreaking' and 'soul-crushing,' asserting such inquiries would be unacceptable today. Hanks, director of the documentary 'John Candy: I Like Me,' aims to explore these pressures in his film. Candy's son, Chris, revealed his father's anxiety about eating publicly, leading to unhealthy eating habits. The documentary also highlights Candy's struggles with anxiety and his efforts to improve his health before his untimely death at 43.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown has left residents of Martinsburg, West Virginia, a town heavily reliant on federal employment, in a state of limbo. Veterans are experiencing extended waits for medical care and job assistance, while federal workers face unpaid leave or work without pay. Small businesses are also feeling the pinch as federal employees cut back on local spending. The ongoing political standoff in Washington over funding has resulted in job cuts and the closure of essential services, causing widespread worry about the future.</p>

          <p>Chinese entities are acquiring significant tracts of land near sensitive U.S. military and government facilities, prompting national security concerns about potential espionage or attacks. Former national security official David Feith warns that this land ownership could provide operating room for intelligence gathering or military strikes, citing Ukraine's drone attacks in Russia as an example. While Chinese ownership is a small percentage of foreign-owned land, 29 states now limit or ban such purchases. The Trump administration plans to increase transparency and collaborate with Congress to curb adversarial countries' land acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin expresses anxiety over current market highs, drawing parallels to the period before the 1929 crash, suggesting the AI boom might be artificially propping up the economy. He questions the sustainability of current prices and predicts an eventual market crash, though he cannot specify when or how deep. Sorkin highlights the increasing speculation and debt in the market, coupled with the erosion of post-1929 guardrails designed to protect investors. He also notes a push to 'democratize' investing by allowing more access to riskier private markets, potentially exposing ordinary investors to greater hazards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retired General Tim Haugh, former head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, warns that China has extensively hacked into U.S. computer networks, targeting critical infrastructure and potentially every American. He highlighted an incident in Littleton, Massachusetts, where China breached a small town's electric and water utility, demonstrating their willingness to target non-military entities. Haugh stated that China's aim is to gain an advantage in a crisis or conflict by disrupting essential services and distracting the U.S. He emphasizes the urgent need for the U.S. to strengthen cyber defenses against these 'unrestricted warfare' tactics.</p>

          <p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly a U.S.-designated terrorist and leader of an al Qaeda affiliate, now faces the immense challenge of stabilizing and rebuilding a war-torn Syria. His forces ended 54 years of Assad family rule in just 11 days, leading to his appointment as president. Al-Sharaa seeks international aid, emphasizing the need for lifted sanctions to rebuild the devastated country, where half the population is displaced. He also faces questions regarding sectarian violence and Israel's actions, while promising future general elections and a democratic Syria.</p>

          <p>Mutassim Abdulsatir, a survivor of Syria's notorious Sednaya prison, recounted his harrowing experiences, detailing systematic torture, starvation, and daily deaths under the Assad regime. Imprisoned for alleged state terrorism, Abdulsatir described being beaten with pipes, confined in tiny cells, and witnessing cellmates die. Human rights groups corroborate these accounts, documenting mass executions and extreme deprivation within the prison. Abdulsatir's testimony, including identifying bodies by numbers on foreheads, aligns with whistleblower reports, underscoring the industrialized nature of the abuses. He advocates for the prison to become a museum and memorial, seeking justice for the victims.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that adults lose about half their friends every seven years due to shifting life stages and commitments, leading to 'relational loneliness.' Experts suggest honest communication, vulnerability, and creativity are key to maintaining bonds. Embracing 'mess' by inviting friends into imperfect moments, such as errands with a baby, can foster connection. Prioritizing in-person meetings over virtual communication is crucial, as social interaction acts like a muscle, strengthening with use. Overcoming the 'liking gap' and trusting in the resilience of friendships are essential for rekindling and sustaining platonic relationships.</p>

          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are using thermal cameras to measure stress levels, observing that a drop in nose temperature indicates acute stress. This physiological response, where blood flow is redirected from the nose to eyes and ears, is a robust marker of changing stress states. The non-invasive technique could be a 'game changer' for stress research, potentially helping to manage harmful stress levels and monitor stress in non-communicative individuals like babies or great apes. The speed of recovery from this 'nasal dip' might also serve as an objective measure of stress regulation.</p>

          <p>A significant lawsuit has commenced in the UK High Court against Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault, and Nissan, accusing them of using 'defeat devices' to cheat emissions tests. This trial is the latest development in the 'dieselgate' scandal, potentially involving 1.6 million car owners who claim they were misled about their vehicles' environmental friendliness. The carmakers deny the accusations, stating their systems are technically and legally justifiable. If found liable, the case could lead to substantial compensation payouts, similar to Volkswagen's £193m settlement, and expose a major breach of corporate trust with significant public health implications.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) advises Chancellor Rachel Reeves to pursue comprehensive tax reform rather than 'directionless tinkering' in the upcoming Budget. With pressure to increase revenue, the IFS warns against economically harmful tax rises and calls for aligning tax rates across different income forms for fairness and growth. Recommendations include reforming property tax, particularly council tax based on current values, and capital gains tax. While acknowledging the need for funds, the IFS cautions against measures like restricting pension tax relief, advocating for bolder, growth-friendly changes to the tax system.

          <p>A new report from the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute declares coral reefs the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate 'tipping point,' signaling an 'unprecedented crisis.'

          <p>Jim Cramer warns of a brewing risk to the stock market rally, citing renewed China trade tensions and a surge in speculative stock offerings. President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports has disrupted perceived US-China detente, impacting major US companies with China exposure. Cramer also highlights the danger of 'Denizens of Sherwood Forest' – highly valued, unprofitable speculative stocks issuing new equity, reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. He advises caution with these stocks, noting that their proliferation could flood the market and bleed into other sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scotland's men's football team has secured at least a play-off spot for the 2026 World Cup finals after a 2-1 victory over Belarus, combined with Denmark's win over Greece. Despite the positive result and manager Steve Clarke making history with his 72nd game in charge, he expressed furious disappointment with his team's 'poor' performance. Midfielder John McGinn described Clarke as the 'wildest I've seen him,' reflecting frustration over a lacklustre display. Scotland now faces Greece away and Denmark at home in crucial matches to determine automatic qualification, with goal difference favoring Denmark.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has demanded answers from Prime Minister Starmer regarding the collapsed spy case against two men accused of spying for China. Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry were dropped after the Director of Public Prosecutions stated evidence, specifically government material referring to China as a national security threat, could not be obtained. Badenoch criticized the government's shifting narrative and alleged a weakness in confronting Beijing. The opposition questions the role of Starmer's national security advisor and calls for ministers to explain why crucial evidence was not provided, suggesting an appeasement of China.</p>
