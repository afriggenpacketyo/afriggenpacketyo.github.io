          <p>Despite a global stock market sell-off following President Trump's announcement of broad-ranging tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the administration remains steadfast in its decision to implement reciprocal tariffs on major U.S. trading partners. Lutnick emphasized that there would be no postponement of the tariffs, which include a 10% duty on all imported goods and higher levies on imports from 57 countries, set to take effect on April 9th. The administration believes these tariffs are necessary to reset global trade imbalances, as Trump seeks to address the trade deficit by ensuring that other countries do not maintain trade surpluses at the expense of the United States. The comments reflect the administration's determination to reshape global trade despite potential economic repercussions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $77,000, as cryptocurrencies joined the global market rout prompted by President Trump's restrictive global tariffs. The price of bitcoin was around 4% lower at $76,221, according to Coin Metrics, after trading above $80,000 for most of this year. The decline triggered a wave of long liquidations, with over $247 million in bitcoin long positions liquidated in the past 24 hours. Investors, rattled by Trump's tariffs and the potential for a global trade war, dumped their cryptocurrency holdings over the weekend, anticipating further market volatility and recession fears.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed concerns that President Trump's newly announced tariffs will likely increase prices on both domestic and imported goods, thus slowing down an already weakening U.S. economy. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon addressed the tariff policy announced on April 2nd, noting the potential for inflationary outcomes due to rising input costs and increased demand for domestic products. While Dimon acknowledges potential legitimate reasons for the tariffs, he emphasizes the significant short-term effects that could create uncertainties regarding global capital flows, corporate profits, and responses from trading partners. He urges for a swift resolution to the issue, cautioning that the negative effects will accumulate over time and become harder to reverse. (<br><i>Not investment advice</i>)</p>

          <p>Overseas financial markets experienced a significant downturn, and U.S. stock futures faced renewed selling pressure following investor concerns about the economic fallout from the Trump administration's latest tariff measures. Major indexes in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Shanghai recorded substantial losses, reflecting widespread apprehension about the potential impact of the tariffs on global trade and economic growth. Economists warn that imposing broad tariffs on goods shipped into the U.S. could drive up inflation, decrease consumer spending, and hurt economic growth, further contributing to market instability. China has already retaliated by imposing tariffs on U.S. products, exacerbating fears of a severe global trade war.</p>

          <p>China's top think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), has closed its public policy research center amidst heightened ideological reinforcement efforts. The CASS stated that the center's activities are now deemed "illegal," and its research projects have been transferred to the Institute of Economics. This move follows reports that the center's former head, economist Zhu Hengpeng, was investigated and removed from his post for criticizing China's economic policies. The closure signals a shift within CASS towards greater loyalty to the ruling Communist Party, reflecting a broader trend of tightening ideological control within Chinese institutions.</p>

          <p>Actor Kevin Bacon shared that his desire to escape the spotlight after "Footloose" and live as a "lonely" farmer led to a major disagreement with his wife, Kyra Sedgwick. Bacon described his longing for a simple life in rural Connecticut, but Sedgwick, a native New Yorker, yearned for the city and its cultural offerings. Sedgwick's desire to raise their children in Manhattan prompted the couple's "biggest fight," ultimately leading them to move to the city, a decision Bacon now acknowledges was the right one. Despite their Hollywood success, Bacon and Sedgwick shielded their children from the pressures of fame, prioritizing a normal upbringing.</p>

The lack of access to such programs, coupled with potential Medicaid cuts, poses a significant threat to aging Americans and their caregivers.

Figures such as House Speaker Mike Johnson and judiciary panel chairman Jim Jordan have echoed Trump's criticisms of judges who have stalled some of his executive orders and Musk's federal agency cuts. The influence of Musk's campaign spending, particularly his substantial support for Trump, is expected to further incentivize Republican lawmakers to align with their agendas.

          <p>The article argues that Corporate America is unlikely to effectively counter President Trump's newly announced tariffs due to the disunited nature of the American business community and the weakness of its coordinating institutions. Despite strong statements against the tariffs from organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, meaningful action is unlikely. The pursuit of individual self-interests and the absence of a unified business lobby hinder any significant challenge to the Republican party's governance. Only an organized working class, the article concludes, can effectively resist Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose large tariffs on all foreign imports has triggered a global trade war, raising the risk of an imminent recession characterized by "stagflation" – stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment. The tariffs function as taxes on imported goods, choking off Americans' access to affordable goods and materials from overseas, which increases inflation. At the same time, the tariffs are likely to slow growth and increase unemployment as businesses hold off on new investments and consumers have less disposable income. While the US economy may avoid prolonged stagflation, the precise consequences of Trump's tariffs are difficult to anticipate, especially given the potential for retaliatory measures from trade partners.</p>

While the ban on producing new petrol and diesel cars will still take effect in 2030, manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines. This decision comes in response to US President Donald Trump's 25% levy on cars imported to the US, a major export market for the UK motor industry.

This shift could lead some emerging market central banks to cut rates more aggressively than the U.S. Federal Reserve, potentially creating headwinds for local currencies.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields are experiencing a significant drop as President Trump's tariffs spur a flight to safety, with investors seeking refuge in less risky assets.

Investors are reacting to the increasing likelihood of a global trade war as countries retaliate with their own tariffs on the United States.

          <p>Asian stock markets have experienced their worst drop in decades, plummeting to levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis in response to President Trump's tariffs.

Countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, and China face particularly steep tariffs, exacerbating concerns about the economic fallout from the administration's trade policies. The market turmoil highlights the sensitivity of Asian economies to global trade dynamics and the potential for significant disruption.</p>

          <p>UAW President Shawn Fain has voiced his support for President Trump's tariffs on the U.S. auto industry, despite disagreeing with many of Trump's other policies. Fain believes that the tariffs address a historic wrong and will help to restore the manufacturing base in the country. He argues that the tariffs are necessary to eliminate the race to the bottom, where companies exploit cheap labor, and that the auto industry can adjust to the changes. He is less concerned about the stock market's decline and more focused on the livelihoods of working-class people.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that colon cancer survivors who engage in regular exercise tend to live longer, potentially even longer than individuals who have never had colon cancer. The study, published in the journal Cancer, highlights the significant impact of physical activity on long-term prognosis for colon cancer patients. Regular exercise can improve survival rates and overall health by triggering beneficial chemical reactions in cells and improving immune function. Experts recommend 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week to reduce the risk of cancer and improve survival outcomes.</p>
