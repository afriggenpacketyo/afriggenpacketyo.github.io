          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, highlighting increased market access for American exports, especially agricultural products, and reduced non-tariff barriers. The final details are still being finalized, with Commerce Secretary Lutnick mentioning the existing 10% tariff that generates revenue for the United States. UK Prime Minister Starmer praised the deal for boosting trade and creating jobs between the two countries. Britain says the deal will cut tariffs on UK cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding that the agreement sets a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is under fire for its decision to withhold bonus payments from laid-off employees. These bonuses were earned for high performance before the workers were let go, but HHS has delayed payouts until after the employees' official separation date, effectively preventing them from receiving the money. Agency officials expressed regret in an email to staff, noting that an appeal to overturn the decision was unsuccessful. The decision impacts employees of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and other standalone offices, while larger agencies like the National Institutes of Health were able to pay out bonuses.</p>

He defended his accomplishments in office, blaming Trump for obstructing a bipartisan border security bill. Biden also expressed that he could have defeated Trump himself but exited the race to avoid dividing the Democratic party.

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination faced strong opposition. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and experience as a former district attorney. Martin's nomination was withdrawn due to criticism over his support for individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. Pirro is a vocal supporter of Trump, who previously pardoned her ex-husband for tax evasion. Senator Thom Tillis cited Martin's support for Capitol riot defendants as his reason for opposing the nomination.</p>

The judges criticized Alabama's "deliberate decision to ignore" their order to create a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing.

The victims represent a fraction of the dozens of women the brothers allegedly lured, drugged, and sexually assaulted over two decades.

          <p>Political editor Chris Mason analyzes the recent trade deal between the UK and the US, noting that it represents a limited but positive development for Prime Minister Starmer. While ministers emphasize the real-world benefits for workers and industries, critics argue that the deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a comprehensive free trade agreement. The agreement offers improved trading conditions compared to the immediate past but may not surpass those of six months prior. Despite the limitations, the deal avoids diluting the UK's Digital Services Tax and sidesteps contentious issues related to the NHS and food standards.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) is facing a lawsuit alleging that the Eaton fire, potentially triggered by SCE's negligence, exposed residents to dangerous levels of lead, asbestos, and other toxic substances. The lawsuit cites a report that found excessive levels of toxic heavy metals in soil samples, even after cleanup efforts. SCE acknowledges that its equipment may have ignited the fire but emphasizes that the cause is still under investigation. The suit seeks compensation for affected residents and medical monitoring for future health issues.</p>

          <p>A mistrial was declared in the murder trial of a Michigan police officer, Christopher Schurr, who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, during a traffic stop, due to the jury's inability to reach a verdict. The incident, captured on multiple cameras, showed Lyoya fleeing from Schurr and a subsequent struggle over the officer's Taser. Schurr testified that he feared for his life during the encounter. The mistrial occurred shortly after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of murder in the killing of Tyre Nichols.</p>

The rise of prominent judges in the news, often due to their involvement in politically charged cases, risks shifting the focus from legal principles to individual actors. This trend aligns with Trump's strategy of attacking judges to delegitimize the court system. While scrutiny of public officials is important, the emphasis on judges' personal attributes over legal reasoning is a step away from a government of laws.</p>

          <p>A directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has led to significant changes in the curriculum at West Point, sparking controversy and resignations. The order instructed military service academies to remove ideologies deemed "divisive" and "un-American," resulting in the cancellation of classes and the removal of certain books. Some professors expressed concern about academic freedom, while academy leaders defended the changes as necessary to ensure cadets develop the intellectual agility needed for critical decisions. The changes have forced faculty to grapple with balancing academic freedom and adherence to military directives.</p>
