        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a Supreme Court hearing, justices expressed skepticism regarding the legality of President Trump's executive order that aims to sharply limit birthright citizenship in the United States. Justice Sotomayor asserted that the order violates established Supreme Court precedents, while Justice Kagan questioned the means by which the executive order's constitutionality could be challenged. The justices' concerns centered on the potential for the order to bypass judicial review, raising fundamental questions about the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Trump defended the order in a social media post, claiming it targets those exploiting citizenship for vacation purposes.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent trade truce with the Trump administration, China continues to restrict exports of seven rare earth metals crucial to the U.S. defense, energy, and automotive industries. While some non-tariff countermeasures against 28 American companies have been temporarily paused, the restrictions on samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium remain in place. This decision follows China's earlier announcement of retaliatory measures, including rare earth export curbs, in response to President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The Chinese Commerce Ministry has also emphasized the need for broader government control of these strategic minerals for national security, highlighting their importance as leverage in trade negotiations with Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan consensus is emerging in Washington that "debanking," the practice of financial institutions closing accounts or denying services based on political positions, is a problem, but finding solutions remains challenging. Brian P. Brooks, a former financial regulator, notes increasing complaints from conservative and religious groups, cryptocurrency companies, and even liberal lawmakers. While banks are prohibited from discriminating based on race or gender, they can refuse services to high-risk customers, leading to accusations of politically motivated discrimination. The Trump administration is considering measures to address the issue, but differing views on the definition and appropriate response complicate the path forward, as some see it as prejudice and others see it as risk management.</p>

          <p>Christian Br√ºckner, the primary suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, will remain in prison longer than anticipated due to an unpaid fine. Br√ºckner, currently serving time for a sexual assault conviction, was scheduled for release in September, but this has been delayed until early next year. He denies any involvement in McCann's disappearance. The delay potentially allows German prosecutors more time to appeal a separate case where Br√ºckner was acquitted of several sexual assault charges. There are no current plans to charge Br√ºckner in connection with Madeleine's disappearance.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling nearly 275,000 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs from the 2022-2024 model years due to a potential issue with the front brake line. A bent brake line could contact the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, leading to damage and a brake fluid leak, potentially reducing brake function and increasing crash risk. The issue stems from faulty assembly during engine installation at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, which was later modified to prevent brake line damage. Owners will be notified by mail, and dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge.</p>

Dick's plans to operate Foot Locker as a separate business unit, maintaining its existing brands, and expects the merger to be accretive to earnings in the first full fiscal year after closing. The acquisition will give Dick's access to Foot Locker's international markets and a younger, more urban customer base, while also raising anti-competition concerns due to the combined company's potential control over Nike wholesale distribution.

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of the year, exceeding expectations, driven by strong spending on services like retail, hospitality, and finance. This growth rate is the highest among the G7 countries, despite global trade shocks from U.S. tariffs. However, economists caution that this growth may be short-lived, as the full impact of U.S. tariffs and rising taxes could slow down the economy in the coming months. A recent trade deal between the UK and the US might alleviate some tariff pressures, but the details and timing of its implementation remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford may be sold by Manchester United for ¬£40m. While Rashford is understood to have enjoyed his time working under Emery and had a significant impact on Villa's run to the Champions League quarter-finals, there have been no negotiations over a permanent transfer. The Rashford camp do not believe current United head coach Ruben Amorim wants to restore the player to his squad, while minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken about his frustration at some of the team's highest earners not being on the pitch. As it stands, sources close to Rashford expect him to return to United for pre-season training in July.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic discusses the influence of parents on their children's personalities and behaviors, citing research that suggests a significant genetic tendency to resemble parents. However, the article emphasizes that individuals have the power to shape their own lives by creating the environment they want and consciously deciding which parental traits to emulate or reject. The author recommends identifying positive and negative traits from one's upbringing and actively working to cultivate the desired characteristics. Ultimately, the article encourages readers to view themselves as works in progress, capable of molding their own identities.</p>

          <p>A new report projects that humanity will farm and kill nearly 6 trillion animals annually by 2033, driven by the increasing consumption of small animals like shrimp, fish, and insects. This transformation in global agriculture patterns has ratcheted up animal suffering to staggering proportions. The report highlights the potential sentience of invertebrates like shrimp and insects, raising ethical concerns about their treatment in factory farming. The author also emphasizes the need for more research into the welfare of these animals and the development of ethical frameworks for their treatment.</p>
