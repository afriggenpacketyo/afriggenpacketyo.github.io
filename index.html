          <p>Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by high demand for personalized vehicles. CEO Benedetto Vigna highlighted the company's strong profitability due to product mix and personalization requests. However, Ferrari warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could reduce profitability by 50 basis points. The company's 2025 guidance includes net revenue exceeding 7 billion euros, with adjusted earnings per share of 8.60 euros. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While some consumer prices, such as airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline, have recently declined, economists warn that these lower prices may not last. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics attributes the price drops to idiosyncratic factors and supply-demand dynamics. Mark Zandi of Moody's notes that tariffs threaten to increase consumer prices, advising consumers to enjoy the lower prices while they last. Gasoline prices have decreased by almost 10% year-over-year, while TV and smartphone prices have fallen 9% and 14%, respectively.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, failed to secure a majority in the initial parliament vote for chancellor, receiving only 310 of the required 316 votes.

          <p>A new study indicates a significant number of serious adverse events among women taking mifepristone, commonly known as the "abortion pill." Experts, including Katie Glenn Daniel from SBA Pro Life America, highlight that the study's findings differ significantly from the FDA's claims on the drug label, with nearly 11% of women experiencing infection, hemorrhaging, or other life-threatening events. Dr. Christina Francis, a board-certified OB/GYN, stated that these data reveal the urgent need for further investigation into complications of drug-induced abortions and for policymakers to reprioritize women's safety.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump used to justify deporting Venezuelans. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct its activities in the U.S. The release of this memo undercuts the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act. The Justice Department had previously opened a criminal investigation into media coverage questioning the administration's claims, but the declassified memo supports the original reporting.</p>

Detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, but the type of notice and hearing varies based on individual circumstances.

          <p>The abrupt end to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's U.S. visit and uncertainty surrounding his planned trip to Moscow signal a crisis in Serbia's foreign policy. Vucic's attempt to meet with Donald Trump at a Republican National Committee event appears to have failed, bypassing standard diplomatic protocol. The EU has warned that a visit to Moscow could jeopardize Serbia's EU membership aspirations, limiting Vucic's room to maneuver amid rising global tensions and image concerns.</p>

          <p>U.S. exports are experiencing a broad decline due to Trump's trade tariffs, impacting agricultural products like soybeans, corn, and beef. Port data reveals export decreases at most U.S. ports, with the Port of Oregon seeing a 51% drop and the Port of Tacoma a 28% decrease. The slide in exports is linked to declining containership arrivals as businesses cancel manufacturing orders. Bank of America warns that retail inventories may become "lean" due to these disruptions, potentially affecting product availability and prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The novel questions the extent to which art justifies moral compromises, using Pabst's choices to illustrate the slippery slope of complicity.

          <p>In his mayoral bid, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo is proposing a plan to remove more mentally ill people from the streets to address public safety concerns in New York City. The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment upon discharge from public hospitals and jails, and adding more supportive housing units. While his ideas are similar to those of Mayor Eric Adams, opponents have criticized Cuomo's past reduction of psychiatric beds as governor.</p>

          <p>A chair of a trial committee of the Writers Guild of America West has alleged that the union's disciplinary process against a member accused of violating strike rules was flawed and improper. Jill Goldsmith, a former public defender, cited concerns over the board's repudiation of the trial committee's findings and the impartiality of the committee's legal counsel. Goldsmith resigned from the committee in protest, raising questions about the fairness of the proceedings.</p>
