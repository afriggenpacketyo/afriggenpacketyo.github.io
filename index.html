          <p>University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape analyzes the rising trend of political violence in the United States, labeling the current period an "era of violent populism." He points to a significant increase in both violent acts and public support for such violence across the political spectrum, citing recent assassinations and attempts on public figures. Pape argues the root cause is not the internet, which he calls an accelerant, but rather a profound social change: the nation's demographic shift from a white majority to a white minority democracy. He urges political leaders to unite in condemning violence to prevent further escalation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a Espana cycling race in Madrid was abandoned due to pro-Palestinian protests that disrupted the course. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road at several key points, making it impossible for the race to proceed safely. As a result, Jonas Vingegaard, who was the leader heading into the final day, was declared the overall winner of the tour. The protests were the latest in a series targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team throughout the event, which had already caused safety concerns and modifications to previous stages of the race.</p>

          <p>The band Coldplay paused their concert at London's Wembley Stadium to honor the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, asking the audience to "send love" to his family. Lead singer Chris Martin led the tribute, encouraging fans to also send love to people they disagree with and those in conflict zones around the world. Coldplay joins other musicians like Morgan Wallen and Jason Aldean who have paid their respects to Kirk following his assassination. These tributes from across the entertainment industry highlight the widespread impact of the activist's death beyond the political sphere.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford jointly condemned the assassination of Charlie Kirk, highlighting the role of the internet as an "accelerant" for political extremism. They argued that social media algorithms amplify the loudest and angriest voices, drowning out civil discourse and contributing to a climate of violence. Both senators expressed concern for their own safety amid thousands of threats against members of Congress this year alone. They advocated for bipartisan legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act to mitigate some of the internet's harmful effects on society and political dialogue.</p>

          <p>Bobby Hart, the songwriter who, with his partner Tommy Boyce, penned some of The Monkees' most iconic hits, has died at the age of 86. The duo was instrumental in creating the band's sound, writing their theme song and their first number one single, "Last Train to Clarksville." Their work also included the classic "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone," which was later covered by the Sex Pistols. Beyond The Monkees, Hart had a prolific career, co-writing the Oscar-nominated ballad "Over You" and contributing to other popular acts, cementing his legacy as a key songwriter of the 1960s and beyond.</p>

          <p>A look back at the 2024 wildfire season reveals how the small Idaho town of Stanley narrowly avoided destruction from two separate massive blazes. The survival of the town and the nearby Redfish Lake Lodge was attributed to heroic firefighting efforts and fortunate shifts in weather. This near-miss serves as a relevant case study as the trend of larger, hotter, and faster wildfires continues across the American West and globally, driven by the climate crisis. Residents and officials reflect on the vulnerability of communities in fire-prone areas, emphasizing that the risk is not diminishing and new strategies are needed to coexist with this threat.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed hope that the assassination of Charlie Kirk could serve as a "turning point" for the United States, urging political leaders to de-escalate their rhetoric.

Johnson emphasized that while Kirk engaged in vigorous debate, he was motivated by love for his fellow man and not hatred for his opponents.

The core of the squad is largely settled, with the main point of discussion likely being the choice for the second spinner to support Shoaib Bashir. McCullum indicated that England might take a squad of 17 players, including up to seven specialist seam bowlers, but will not select a specialist back-up wicketkeeper. The settled nature of the team suggests confidence and stability as they prepare for one of cricket's most significant series.</p>

This strategy was partly motivated by a significant injury in 2020, which reminded him of the finite nature of an NFL career and the need to build long-term wealth.

Foster's hiring in February 2024 was considered unconventional due to his lack of head coaching experience, and his final record stands at 5-10.

          <h2>Banks and Credit Card Companies Grow Wary of "Buy Now, Pay Later" Services</h2>

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is causing concern for traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, are seen as a direct competitor, reducing credit card transaction volume and utilization, which are major revenue drivers. Financial institutions are also wary because BNPL usage creates a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile, as this debt is often not reported to credit bureaus. This makes it difficult for lenders to accurately assess a person's overall credit risk and financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a visit aimed at managing diplomatic tensions following several controversial Israeli actions. The trip addresses U.S. irritation over an Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, which targeted Hamas leaders but also killed a Qatari security officer, straining relations with a key U.S. ally. Rubio's visit also comes as Israel faces international criticism for its ongoing military operations in Gaza and the expansion of settlements. While Netanyahu emphasized the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance, Rubio's presence signals an effort to navigate significant international pressure and disagreement.</p>
