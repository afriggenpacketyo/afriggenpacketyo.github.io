          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a downturn, mirroring losses from Wall Street as investor anxiety grew over rising global bond yields and potential trade tariffs. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 saw a decline, and yields on Japanese Government Bonds rose to multi-year highs, reflecting broader market uncertainty. South Korean and Australian markets also fell, with investors closely watching for new economic data and geopolitical developments, including a major military parade in China. The widespread caution highlights the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the significant impact of trade policy discussions on investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China hosted a large-scale military parade in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of World War II. President Xi Jinping was joined by 26 world leaders, most notably Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, showcasing a deepening of ties between the three nations. The event, held in Tiananmen Square, featured a display of China's military hardware and was attended by an estimated 50,000 spectators. The gathering of these specific leaders is viewed by analysts as a significant geopolitical statement in opposition to the United States and its Western allies.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson surprised fans with a significantly leaner physique while attending the Venice Film Festival. His appearance has sparked widespread discussion on social media, with many users commenting on his transformation for his role as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson has previously stated that the role required extensive makeup and prosthetics, and his physical change is seen as part of his dedication to the dramatic part. The film, which also stars Emily Blunt, received a 15-minute standing ovation at its premiere, generating early awards season buzz for the actor's performance.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a Labour peer and former senior civil servant, has questioned the UK government's decision to restrict a key civil service internship program to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Arguing from her own working-class origins, she stated that she benefited greatly from exposure to people from diverse walks of life and questioned the evidence base for the new policy. The government contends the change will widen the talent pool and make the civil service more reflective of the country. However, the move has drawn criticism for potentially discriminating against children of certain professions, such as roofers or nurses, based on parental occupation.</p>

The incident has prompted law enforcement to remind the public of the importance of reporting suspicious activity, emphasizing that community vigilance can help prevent potential crimes before they occur.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has returned from its August recess to a demanding schedule with a looming September 30 deadline to prevent a government shutdown. Lawmakers face a partisan divide on spending levels, making a short-term funding measure likely. Other key priorities include President Trump's push for a new crime bill and an extension of federal control over Washington D.C.'s police force. Additionally, there is continued pressure from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to compel the Department of Justice to release all files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, promising a contentious and busy legislative session.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have co-authored an op-ed in The New York Times, accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The former directors, who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations, expressed grave concerns that political ideology is taking precedence over science.

The new approach emphasizes that with proper training, equipment, and home hardening measures, homeowners can significantly increase the chances of their property surviving. This potential policy shift is based on instances where residents successfully saved their homes using simple tools like garden hoses when professional resources were overwhelmed.</p>

          <p>Nearly 25 years after 9/11, new commercial aircraft are being delivered with secondary cockpit barriers, a feature mandated by Congress in 2018 to enhance security. These retractable gates block access to the flight deck when the main cockpit door is open, preventing potential hijacking attempts during these vulnerable moments. Major airlines like Southwest, United, and American have confirmed receiving their first planes with these barriers installed.

In a 2-1 decision, the court affirmed that FTC commissioners are protected from being removed by a president without cause, citing nearly a century of legal precedent. The ruling represents a significant check on presidential power over independent regulatory agencies. The White House had argued for the authority to remove commissioners, but the court found that the administration was not likely to succeed in its appeal, reinforcing the agency's insulation from partisan politics.</p>

          <p>Investors responded positively to the remedies ordered in Google's landmark antitrust case, sending parent company Alphabet's stock up 8% in after-hours trading. The market's relief stems from Judge Amit Mehta's decision to reject the Department of Justice's most severe proposals, such as the forced sale of the Chrome browser. While Google must end exclusive search-default contracts and share some data, the ruling was viewed as far less damaging than it could have been. The outcome is seen as a significant victory for the tech giant, allowing it to maintain its core business structure while making court-mandated adjustments to its competitive practices.

          <p>Police forces and councils across the UK are issuing fresh warnings about a rise in parking-related scams. Fraudsters are using methods such as fake text messages demanding payment for non-existent fines and physical 'skimming' devices attached to payment machines to steal credit card details. To avoid falling victim, experts advise checking that any fine notice includes the vehicle registration, time, and location of the offense. Additionally, people should be wary of clicking links in unsolicited texts and should inspect payment machines for any signs of tampering, such as mismatched branding or parts that look bolted on.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at sanctioning Chinese officials who fail to take action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursors. The legislation also targets Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement credible measures to prevent their products from entering the illicit drug trade. Proponents argue the bill is a necessary step to attack the opioid crisis at its source. While the bill received support from both parties, some Democrats emphasized that sanctions alone are not enough and that effective diplomacy and law enforcement cooperation with China and Mexico are indispensable.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that its deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement duties in Los Angeles was a 'serious violation' of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The judge's opinion stated that the administration knowingly circumvented the law by creating a 'constitutional exception' that was not grounded in precedent or common sense. This ruling blocks further similar deployments in California and sets a significant legal precedent as the administration considers sending troops to other U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Protests against tourists are growing in frequency and intensity in popular destinations like Mexico City and Barcelona, as local residents express frustration over rising prices and strained infrastructure. Demonstrators are using slogans like 'Gringos leave' and 'Tourists go home' to voice their anger about being priced out of their own neighborhoods by an influx of digital nomads and vacationers. While some travelers are caught off guard by the hostility, the demonstrations reflect a deeper issue of unsustainable tourism models.

          <p>A columnist for the Los Angeles Times argues that while a federal judge correctly ruled the Trump administration's National Guard deployment in Los Angeles was illegal, the trial revealed a more disturbing trend. Testimony from Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman showed that his loyalty to the country was questioned by a federal official simply for hesitating over the legality and wisdom of a proposed operation. The article suggests this is evidence of increasing pressure on military leaders to shift their allegiance from the Constitution to President Trump personally. This dynamic could undermine the rule of law regardless of court rulings, moving the country closer to a 'national police force.'</p>

          <p>The investigation into the death of actor Matthew Perry has led to charges against five individuals, exposing a network that illegally supplied him with ketamine. Court documents reveal Perry was receiving multiple injections of the drug daily from his personal assistant in the weeks before his fatal overdose. The main supplier, known as the 'Ketamine Queen,' allegedly dealt exclusively with high-end and celebrity clients and has agreed to plead guilty. The case sheds light on the dangerous intersection of celebrity, wealth, and addiction, as well as the power imbalance that can exist between stars and their staff.</p>

          <p>Following a market downturn led by profit-taking in major tech stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain their positions in high-quality companies. He characterized the decline as typical for September, a historically challenging month for stocks, and suggested it was not driven by fundamental issues with leading companies like Nvidia or Apple. Cramer pointed to investor concerns over a recent court ruling on tariffs and the upcoming labor report as contributing factors to the sell-off. He urged long-term investors to trust their holdings and view such pullbacks as routine market behavior rather than a reason to panic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The election of Zack Polanski as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales signals a significant shift in the party's direction and could further fragment the UK's left-wing vote. Polanski's blunt, digitally-savvy style contrasts with the more traditional approach of his predecessors and may appeal to voters disillusioned with the Labour Party. However, this move to the left presents challenges, as it could create competition for the same voters being courted by Jeremy Corbyn's new political movement. It also risks alienating the party's supporters in more conservative, rural constituencies that were key to their recent electoral gains.</p>

While Allen noted that he disagrees with nearly all of Trump's policies and voted for Kamala Harris, his positive personal assessment was quickly shared by Trump on social media.
