          <p>The Trump administration is retroactively dismissing asylum applications from individuals who entered the U.S. between 2019 and 2022. According to notifications sent to applicants, their cases are being closed because they did not undergo a mandatory 'credible fear' interview at the border, a step that was often skipped due to a shortage of asylum officers. This policy change forces people who have been living and working legally in the country for years to restart the complex process from the beginning. Immigration lawyers express concern that this could make their clients undocumented and vulnerable to detention and deportation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is anticipating its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures forecasted to climb over 30°C in the coming days. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England from Monday to Wednesday. Forecasters predict temperatures will peak at 34°C in the south Midlands on Tuesday, meeting the official heatwave criteria of three consecutive days above a certain threshold. This warm spell, driven by high pressure and remnants of a tropical storm, marks a significant shift from the recent stormy weather.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving via new ferry connections. Turkish tourists are drawn to the island's relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to holiday destinations in their own country. This influx is providing a welcome economic boost to local businesses on Lesbos and fostering positive cross-cultural interactions. Despite ongoing political tensions between the Greek and Turkish governments over maritime borders, the goodwill generated by tourism offers a hopeful example of grassroots diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have demonstrated across Israel against the government's plan to expand its military operation. The security cabinet's approval of a plan to take 'security control' over the Gaza Strip has sparked fears that it endangers the lives of the remaining hostages. Demonstrators are urging the government to prioritize a deal for the hostages' release, with some former soldiers publicly refusing to serve in the expanded operation. The plan has also drawn international condemnation and warnings of catastrophic consequences for civilians from the United Nations.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in Beijing has developed a new set of genome editing tools, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE) systems, that significantly improve the ability to edit large DNA fragments. This breakthrough makes the complex process of chromosome editing more efficient and precise, capable of handling millions of DNA bases in higher organisms like plants. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this technology could revolutionize crop improvement and the treatment of genetic diseases. The advance is also expected to accelerate the development of artificial chromosomes for applications in synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Young people in Shanghai are redefining the city's nightlife, with a growing passion for live performances fueling a significant portion of the nighttime economy. Instead of traditional nightlife venues, many in Gen Z are spending their evenings and money in theaters, socializing and collecting show-related merchandise. This trend is supported by the city's 'Night Economy 2.0' initiative, which aims to boost consumption by simplifying the approval process for nighttime cultural events. The government sees this cultural spending as a key driver for stimulating the domestic economy amidst wider financial pressures.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, key European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that Ukraine must be included in any peace negotiations. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and others emphasized that international borders cannot be changed by force and that Ukraine must have the freedom to choose its own destiny. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that any agreement reached without Kyiv's involvement would be a 'dead decision'. The European statement reflects growing concern over being excluded from discussions that directly impact their continent's security.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah publicly questioned European football's governing body, UEFA, over a tribute to former Palestinian international player Suleiman al-Obeid.

          <p>The founder of Chinese robotics company Unitree, Wang Xingxing, predicts that the field of robotics could experience its 'ChatGPT moment' within the next two to three years. He defines this milestone as the point when a robot can perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. Speaking at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, Wang stated that while hardware is sufficient, the current AI for 'embodied intelligence' is inadequate. He suggested that generative video models, like Google's Genie 3, might be more promising for achieving this breakthrough than current approaches.</p>

          <p>A small, circular piece of a bathroom door lock proved to be the crucial evidence in solving the murder of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig. Initially, Matthew Ecker, the man present at the scene, claimed Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide, and that he broke the door down afterward. However, investigators found the metal lock component underneath Pennig's body. This discovery indicated that the door was forced open before she was shot and fell, contradicting Ecker's story. This key piece of forensic evidence led to Ecker being charged and ultimately convicted of second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are urgently pleading with residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all water usage, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage. A broken valve disrupted water to about 9,200 households, and continued consumption is preventing the system from building necessary pressure, delaying repairs. A 10-million-gallon tank meant to serve the area has seen its water level drop due to resident use. The situation was complicated further when a temporary bypass pipe failed, which will likely add hours to the repair timeline for the underground valve.</p>

Unlike during the Cold War, these weapons are increasingly viewed as offensive tools for winning wars, not just deterrents, raising the risk of a catastrophic conflict.

          <p>The man who shot and killed a police officer after opening fire at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta had reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for causing his depression and suicidal thoughts. According to his father, 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White had become fixated on the vaccine and was upset over his dog's death. White was stopped from entering the CDC building, then drove to a nearby pharmacy and began shooting, killing DeKalb County Officer David Rose. The incident has drawn attention to the real-world violence potentially fueled by anti-science narratives and vaccine misinformation.</p>
