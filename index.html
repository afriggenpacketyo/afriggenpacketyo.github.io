The article explores the potential breakup's impact on Alphabet's valuation, detailing analyst estimates for its key assets including Chrome, Google Cloud, YouTube, and Waymo, highlighting the company's complex financial and regulatory landscape.

The incident occurred amid heightened tensions over the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city, following President Trump's declaration of a public safety emergency. While the administration cites rising crime, local officials and police statistics indicate that violent crime has actually decreased, creating a contentious debate over the necessity of federal intervention.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old New York man has been arrested on federal cyberstalking charges for allegedly leaving a series of threatening and profane voicemails for the widow of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The calls were made just hours after Thompson was fatally shot in Manhattan in December, with the suspect reportedly calling the deceased a "capitalist pig" and stating he deserved to die. Investigators traced the calls to the suspect's personal phone, and he now faces up to five years in prison if convicted of the charges.</p>

The storm, which developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, is projected to strengthen into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean by the end of the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, and it has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, where a state of emergency was declared.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation, Mexico has transferred 26 high-level cartel figures to U.S. custody to face justice for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. The extradited individuals include leaders from groups aligned with the notorious Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels. This move occurs as the Trump administration increases pressure on Mexico to combat criminal networks, although Mexican officials state the transfers were sovereign decisions and not part of broader negotiations to avoid threatened U.S. tariffs.</p>

The franchise's growth is largely attributed to its return to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium, which has significantly boosted revenue and brand profile.

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and life-threatening brain-eating amoeba infection in a patient who is now being treated in an intensive care unit. The infection, caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, was possibly contracted after the individual was water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks. This type of infection occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose, and while the amoeba is common, the resulting disease is extremely rare, with only 167 cases reported in the U.S. since 1962.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks rallied significantly, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, as investors grow more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This optimism for lower borrowing costs, which disproportionately benefit smaller companies, contrasted with a slight decline in the tech-heavy Magnificent 7 Index. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, following weaker jobs data and a cooler-than-expected inflation report, which could boost economic activity.

          <h2>Economists Widely Expect Higher Consumer Inflation from Tariffs, Defending Goldman Sachs's View</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent criticism from President Trump, Goldman Sachs is not alone in its forecast that increased tariffs will lead to higher consumer inflation, a view shared by many Wall Street economists. The consensus is that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, consumers will increasingly bear the cost of the duties, potentially adding 1-1.5% to inflation. While this could slow consumer spending and GDP growth, most economists do not expect the temporary inflation spike to deter the Federal Reserve from beginning to lower interest rates later this year.
