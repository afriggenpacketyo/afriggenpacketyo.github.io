          <p>Severe flash floods have struck Texas's Hill Country, resulting in at least 13 confirmed fatalities. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in under an hour, causing widespread destruction of property and leading to numerous water rescues. Officials are particularly concerned about Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, where approximately 20 children remain unaccounted for following the "catastrophic level" of flooding. State and federal resources have been mobilized for extensive search and rescue operations, with authorities expecting the death toll to climb as floodwaters recede.</p>

Policy guidelines focus on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through increased digitalization and automation. This strategic push comes as both South Korea and Japan position themselves to compete more effectively, particularly as the United States targets China's dominance in the global shipbuilding market.</p>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizure. Opponents label the practice as predatory, arguing that it disproportionately targets working-class and low-income residents who may be unable to afford the high fees to retrieve their cars on short notice. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of specifically targeting apartment complexes in these neighborhoods. The company's owner defends the practice, stating he is simply enforcing the parking rules established by the property managers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed his signature "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" into law, a sweeping package that makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent while implementing major spending changes. The legislation boosts funding for defense and border security but also enacts significant cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid. While the administration touts the law as a victory for the American people, Democrats have fiercely opposed it, warning it will increase the national debt by an estimated $3 trillion. Critics also project that millions could lose health insurance coverage under the new provisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly signed tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts note that while this provides some tax relief, it is not a repeal of the tax on benefits and primarily helps higher-income seniors. The move was a way to offer tax relief within congressional rules, but some analysts warn it could add financial pressure to the already strained Social Security trust fund.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of eight migrants with criminal records to South Sudan. The men, originally from Latin America and Asia, had been held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti after a lower court initially blocked their removal. The high court's ruling clarified that its previous stay on a broad injunction against third-country removals meant the lower court could not enforce its order protecting this specific group.

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters to hibernate, burning the fat and releasing the carbon deep underwater. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of about 55 million cars. The discovery highlights the Southern Ocean's critical role in absorbing excess heat, though growing threats to these vital creatures are a cause for concern.</p>

The fraudsters appear to target unclaimed estates listed on a public government register, producing fake wills that name a member of the gang as the sole heir. By exploiting weaknesses in the digitized probate application system, they can gain legal control over a deceased person's assets and commit tax fraud by undervaluing the estates. The report details several cases where rightful heirs were cheated out of their inheritance, highlighting a system that critics say lacks sufficient human scrutiny to detect fraud.</p>

The legislation's structure, which extends tax cuts, favors business owners, and caps state and local tax deductions, disproportionately benefits the rich in low-tax states.

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly approved budget bill that significantly funds them. The mood was described as solemn, with many attendees stating they were skipping traditional holiday celebrations to stand in solidarity with immigrant communities. Protesters marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, where immigration court is held, chanting against deportations. The rally highlights the heightened fear and tension in the region following weeks of aggressive enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

          <p>Germany started its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, the team's performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears after a knee injury in the first half. Given her history of two previous ACL injuries, her availability for the rest of the tournament is in serious doubt, casting a shadow over the victory. The match saw Brand score her first-ever tournament goal, a crucial step up as the team looks for new leaders following recent high-profile retirements.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will implement significant changes at U.S. national parks, including charging higher entry fees for international visitors. The order also mandates preferential treatment for U.S. residents in park lotteries and permitting, with revenue from increased foreign fees directed toward infrastructure improvements. Additionally, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the management and storytelling within the national park system. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of dismantling government DEI programs established under previous administrations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Within Global South-focused alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS, India is emerging as a significant counterweight to China's leadership ambitions. Both organizations require consensus for decision-making, a rule that frequently allows India to assert its own strategic interests. A recent example occurred when SCO defense ministers failed to adopt a joint statement due to a lack of consensus on language related to terrorism, a key issue for India. This dynamic highlights the complex relationship between the two Asian giants as they compete for influence within these multilateral forums.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks outlines five "toxic" food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, and deep-fried foods cooked in reused industrial oils. The article advocates for healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins to build healthy eating habits from childhood.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run, last-ball victory at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but England seamer Lauren Bell secured the win by having captain Harmanpreet Kaur caught. The match featured a stunning momentum shift, with India in control before a fast-bowling spell from Lauren Filer, who dismissed two key batters, turned the tide. England's own innings was a tale of two halves, racing to 137-0 before a dramatic collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs to finish on 171-9.</p>
