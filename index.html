          <p>Hurricane Humberto rapidly strengthened into a Category 5, significantly impacting the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda with its powerful winds. The Miami-based National Hurricane Center warns it will likely remain a major hurricane for several days, with forecasters urging Bermuda residents to monitor its progression closely. Furthermore, the U.S. East Coast, from Florida to North Carolina, could experience life-threatening surf and rip currents generated by the storm starting Monday. This intense storm marks the eighth named system of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with another developing tropical depression also being monitored in the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Elliott, then 17, is accused of the fatal stabbing of his twin sister Meghan in her sleep, a crime with no known motive that he attributes to sleepwalking. His parents, family, and defense attorneys strongly support this claim, citing Benjamin's and close relatives' history of sleepwalking and corroborating sleep studies. However, prosecutors remain unconvinced, questioning his account and the medical examiner's finding of two neck wounds. The "48 Hours" premiere investigates this extraordinary and heartbreaking case, exploring the rare but sometimes successful use of sleepwalking as a criminal defense, leaving the family to face an unimaginable tragedy.</p>

          <p>Moldova is holding parliamentary elections deemed pivotal for its European Union membership prospects, with pro-EU President Maia Sandu warning of extensive Russian interference. Two pro-Russian parties, Greater Moldova and Heart of Moldova, were disqualified for illegal financing and foreign funding, underscoring external pressures on the former Soviet republic. Polls suggest Sandu's ruling party may lose its majority, making the outcome crucial for whether Moldova continues its pro-European course or is drawn back into Moscow's orbit. The election is set against a backdrop of surging disinformation campaigns, testing the strength of Moldova's democracy and its aspiration to join the EU by the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed "snapback" sanctions on Iran, freezing assets, halting arms deals, and penalizing ballistic missile development, as European nations cite Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. This action comes amidst Iran's reeling economy, with its rial currency at a record low and surging food prices, intensifying public hardship and fears of renewed conflict with Israel or the U.S. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons, calling the sanctions "unfair" and "illegal." While the U.S. Secretary of State praised the action, diplomacy remains an option if Iran accepts direct talks, though Tehran's response is uncertain.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests the Trump era could usher in a "reverse convergence" in US-China relations, moving beyond traditional ideological divides. It posits that the US might adopt a similar pragmatic approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace as China, rather than solely imposing liberal democratic values. This shift is not seen as the US losing soft power, but rather a convergence in governance styles, challenging the long-held Western "convergence theory" that societies become more alike as they industrialize.

By re-wetting peat soils, which typically release carbon dioxide when dry, growing rice could help lock in greenhouse gases, potentially cutting national emissions. This project represents a radical breakthrough in balancing farming with environmental concerns, offering a sustainable agricultural model for a changing climate and potentially bringing UK-grown rice to dinner plates within the next decade.</p>

This led to the development of a prototype UV-C light-equipped shoe rack that effectively sterilizes footwear in minutes, eliminating the stink. The award, organized by the journal Annals of Improbable Research, celebrates their "silly but inventive" scientific endeavor, offering a practical solution to a universal domestic design problem.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, stemming from his baseless 2020 election-rigging claims. Giuliani's allegations, made on behalf of President Trump, caused significant damage to Dominion's reputation and undermined public trust in U.S. elections, triggering death threats against election officials. This settlement follows similar agreements with Fox News and Newsmax, adding to Giuliani's mounting legal and financial setbacks, which include disbarment and a $148 million judgment to two former Georgia election workers he defamed. The resolution brings a measure of accountability for the spread of election conspiracy theories.</p>

The protests follow Starbucks' recent announcement of hundreds of store closures and layoffs affecting nearly 1,000 employees, as well as legal actions by workers over dress code changes implemented without proper union bargaining. The union, representing 12,000 workers, warns of potential strikes if the company continues to implement policies without negotiating, while Starbucks maintains it offers competitive pay and benefits, blaming the union for the negotiation stalemate.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Scottish gangland feud between the Lyons and Daniel families has escalated globally, leading to the arrests of four major crime figures, including Steven Lyons, in Dubai. Police Scotland links the individuals to drug importation and a new wave of violence across Scotland's central belt, with one faction reportedly orchestrating attacks from their new home in Dubai. The arrests highlight the international reach of organized crime and the UAE's increasing cooperation with extradition requests, though official details from the Gulf authorities remain scarce.

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is training thousands of civilian militia members for a potential U.S. attack, following U.S. navy strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean that killed 17 people. Maduro views the U.S. actions as an "undeclared war," intensifying already strained relations with the Trump administration, which does not recognize his re-election. While experts doubt the U.S. naval deployment is large enough for an invasion, Maduro's plan aims to increase the human cost of any potential U.S. military action. The populace shows mixed reactions to the call to arms, with some eager to defend the homeland and others unperturbed by the rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new family-friendly Model Y L has achieved stunning success in China, selling out through October with over 35,000 orders placed on launch day alone. This rapid demand is crucial for Tesla, which has faced slowing sales globally due to political factors and increased competition in European markets. By expanding cabin space and lowering prices, the Model Y L is broadening EV appeal in China, the world's largest EV market, thereby contributing to a significant reduction in transportation pollution. The EPA's report corroborates that EVs dramatically reduce heat-trapping gases, offering environmental and cost-saving benefits for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece highlights his consistent projection of being above normal political, legal, or diplomatic consequences, fostering an aura of untouchability.

          <p>This article explores the efficacy of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, with consultant dermatologists expressing skepticism despite anecdotal evidence from users. While marine collagen peptides may have a better chance of absorption through the gut, the idea of them specifically targeting skin is questioned, and topical creams are deemed ineffective as collagen molecules are too large. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, but independent research finds little substantial effect. Experts conclude that robust evidence for oral and topical collagen is lacking, emphasizing that sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking have a far greater impact on skin health.</p>
