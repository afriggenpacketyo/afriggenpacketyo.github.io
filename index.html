          <p>Emil Bove, a judicial nominee and former Trump defense attorney, avoided direct answers in a Senate questionnaire regarding whether the Constitution permits a third presidential term. He also declined to denounce the January 6 Capitol attack, calling its characterization a matter of political debate and citing ongoing litigation as a reason not to comment. Bove, nominated for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, has faced scrutiny from Democrats for his past actions at the Justice Department, including his role in dropping a case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. His responses have intensified concerns about his impartiality and interpretation of constitutional limits.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong investor confidence. The rally was also supported by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and a broader upswing in technology stocks. This price movement triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward trend as traders covered their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than four years away from Test cricket due to injuries, England's fast bowler Jofra Archer made a sensational return against India at Lord's. In his first spell, Archer showcased his signature pace and hostility, dismissing key Indian batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal with just his third delivery. His performance, which included speeds exceeding 93 mph, immediately demonstrated the high-impact quality England has been missing. The powerful display has generated significant excitement and optimism about his ability to reinvigorate the team's bowling attack for the remainder of the series and beyond.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger users for commercial gain. The state's attorney general hailed the decision as a crucial step toward holding TikTok accountable for practices that put children at risk. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than user-generated content.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who led London's Metropolitan Police as commissioner from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72 after a brief illness.

Despite the controversies, he was remembered by the current commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, as an influential leader who made vast contributions to policing. Lord Blair's career was ultimately cut short when he was forced to resign by then-mayor Boris Johnson, who expressed a lack of confidence in his leadership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reorganization by laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees, part of a plan to reduce its domestic workforce by about 15%.

Critics, including Senate Democrats and the American Foreign Service Association, have condemned the move, arguing the indiscriminate cuts will undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic efforts.

          <p>In a contentious legal hearing, attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to mandate that the government provide at least 72 hours' notice before any attempt to deport him. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously removed to El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation due to fears of persecution. The judge heavily criticized the government for its handling of the "highly irregular case" and its lack of a clear plan to ensure his due process rights are protected should he be released from his current detention in Tennessee.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Treasury Reports Unexpected $27 Billion Surplus in June Driven by Tariff Revenue</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely attributed to a surge in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, reflecting the impact of new across-the-board tariffs. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit still stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a significant financial challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month alone, underscoring the ongoing fiscal pressures facing the government.

          <p>Alarming reports from Syria indicate a pattern of abductions targeting women from the Alawite minority, with dozens now considered missing. One victim recounted being kidnapped, beaten, and held for ransom, while her family was blackmailed with photos of her abuse. This trend has raised fears that the Alawite community, from which former dictator Bashar Assad hails, is being systematically targeted by extremist groups and others following the regime's ousting. Human rights organizations have documented multiple cases, highlighting the severe danger and brutality these women face in the country's unstable environment.</p>

The article claims Patel is using polygraph tests to find staff who have spoken negatively about him, while Gabbard is reportedly using AI to scan agency communications for dissent against the administration's agenda. The author argues these actions are reminiscent of authoritarian tactics, prioritizing political loyalty over national security missions like catching spies or terrorists, thereby damaging morale and creating new security risks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is grappling with a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, forcing the agency to ask some laid-off employees to return to work temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic processes implemented by the Trump administration, which have stalled funding for critical programs such as residential services for unaccompanied migrant children and the National Indigenous Domestic Violence Hotline. The department is now in a race against time to process the grants before the end of the fiscal year, potentially by shortening application periods.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about the future solvency of Social Security, seniors are exploring alternative ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines three potential financial strategies for homeowners aged 62 and older. These include taking out a reverse mortgage to receive monthly payments from home equity, purchasing an annuity to guarantee a lifelong income stream, or securing a personal loan for more immediate financial needs. Each option presents a different approach to generating funds, though they come with distinct financial commitments and considerations for retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners seeking quick access to their home equity, several modern lending strategies can significantly speed up the HELOC application process. This article suggests considering fully online lenders, which use digital platforms for faster processing, or applying for a low-documentation HELOC to reduce paperwork. Other methods include working with your existing mortgage lender, who already has your financial data, or choosing a lender that uses automated appraisals. While these options can provide funds in days rather than weeks, they may come with trade-offs like higher rates or stricter eligibility. (not investment advice)</p>
