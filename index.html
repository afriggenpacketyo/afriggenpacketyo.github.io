          <p>Berlin is moving forward with plans to build a national memorial dedicated to the victims of communist dictatorship in Germany, particularly those who suffered under the German Democratic Republic (GDR). This project, described as "long overdue" by victims' associations, is expected to receive necessary funding in the 2026 federal budget, paving the way for a design competition. The memorial aims to honor the estimated 350,000 people imprisoned for opposing the system and the more than 600 who died attempting to flee to West Germany. Proponents emphasize the importance of remembering this history to highlight the stark differences between dictatorship and democracy.</p>

          <p>Argentina's national rugby team, the Pumas, achieved a landmark 29-23 victory over the New Zealand All Blacks in Buenos Aires, marking their first-ever home win against the formidable opponents. Juan Martin Gonzalez and Gonzalo Garcia scored tries, while Santiago Carreras contributed 13 crucial points through kicks. Despite New Zealand's three tries, their performance was hampered by ill-discipline, leading to three sin-bins. This triumph is Argentina's fourth overall against the All Blacks in 41 Tests, breaking a 40-year home drought and showcasing a significant moment in the team's history.</p>

          <p>A Russian tourist shared her experience at North Korea's newly opened Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone, describing a tightly controlled vacation where visitors were accompanied by guards and followed a fixed itinerary. The resort, intended to boost tourism, is currently only accessible to Russian tour groups, with other foreigners temporarily barred. While the tourist enjoyed immaculate, nearly empty beaches, human rights groups have raised concerns about alleged forced labor and harsh conditions during the resort's construction. This article highlights North Korea's cautious approach to foreign tourism, aiming to prevent locals from unfavorably comparing their lives with wealthier visitors.</p>

          <p>Russia claims a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at its Kursk nuclear power plant, which was quickly extinguished with no casualties or change in radiation levels. This incident occurred as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visiting Kyiv to reaffirm support. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also expressed solidarity, while Norway pledged significant air defense systems to Ukraine. Concurrently, a Wall Street Journal report indicates the Pentagon is blocking Ukraine from using US-made long-range missiles for strikes inside Russia, a decision coinciding with President Trump's public frustration over the lack of a peace deal.</p>

Experts like Joseph Stiglitz warn that Trump's tariff policies risk triggering stagflation and making the US a "scary place to invest," while others express concern over American isolationism and its impact on human capital. Despite these warnings, some, including Hillary Clinton, have conditionally supported his Nobel bid if he achieves a just peace in Ukraine.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-firing of two new types of antiair missiles, showcasing the nation's expanding military capabilities. This development coincides with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's diplomatic visits to Tokyo and Washington for summits with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US President Trump. Kim's government continues to reject calls for denuclearization talks, instead prioritizing Russia as a key ally. North Korea has provided thousands of troops and significant weapon shipments to support Russia's war in Ukraine, raising concerns that Moscow may reciprocate by supplying technology to bolster Pyongyang's aging air defense systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the Atlantic Ocean, southeast of Bermuda, becoming the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen over the weekend, potentially reaching hurricane status by Monday, before gradually weakening by Tuesday. The storm is expected to remain over the open ocean, moving north-northeast and staying well east of Bermuda. This development aligns with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season this year, following Hurricane Erin, which previously reached Category 5 intensity without making landfall.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have dropped to second place in the National League West after a 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, marked by a significant offensive slump. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the team's misplaced intent, noting their failure to adjust against crafty pitching and relying too heavily on home runs instead of building rallies. In two games, the Dodgers managed only two runs and five hits, prompting a "look-in-the-mirror moment" as they face a crucial closing month. The article emphasizes the need for collective adjustments and a more team-minded approach to regain their division lead.</p>

          <p>An Asus subsidiary is constructing a supercomputer in Taiwan, projected to boost the island's total computing capacity by at least 50%. The initial phase, with an 80 petaflop capacity, is slated for launch in December, with plans for a total capacity of 250 petaflops. This ambitious project, a collaboration between Taiwan AI Cloud and the National Centre for High-Performance Computing, is a key component of Taiwan's strategic goal to become one of Asia's top three computing powers. The government aims to expand the island's overall computing capacity to approximately 1,200 petaflops by 2029.</p>

          <p>The case of Kilmar Ábrego García, an El Salvadoran man, has become a focal point in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, illustrating what critics call a "haphazard rush" to deport individuals without due process. Ábrego, who fled gang violence in El Salvador and denies alleged MS-13 affiliation, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a judge's protection order, then returned to the US and threatened with deportation to Uganda. His legal battles highlight concerns from human rights advocates about vindictive prosecution and the administration's aggressive enforcement tactics, raising questions about fundamental US law and human rights.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plummeted, losing nearly $100 million in market value, following the release of its new logo that removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" character. This redesign, part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's effort to refresh the brand and make it more "relevant," faced immediate backlash from Wall Street and conservative commentators, many of whom labeled it "woke" and "soulless." Marketing experts also criticized the move for alienating long-time fans. Despite the company's assurance that its values remain unchanged, the incident highlights the financial risks and public scrutiny associated with corporate rebranding efforts in a politically charged environment.
