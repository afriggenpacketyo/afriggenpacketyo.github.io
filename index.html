          <p>Federal prosecutors in Germany have charged eight suspected members of a far-right extremist group known as the "Saxony Separatists." The men are accused of planning to violently seize territory in the state of Saxony following a perceived collapse of the German government, an event they referred to as "day X." Their objective was to establish an independent state based on Nazi ideology, which included plans for ethnic cleansing. The group was uncovered and its members arrested during a police raid in November 2024.</p>

The president sought to remove Cook based on allegations of misrepresentations on past mortgage agreements, but the judge found this was not a legally permissible cause for removal from her current role. This case has significant implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve, as it marks an unprecedented attempt by a president to remove a governor from the board.</p>

          <p>Official Downing Street documents obtained by BBC News describe foreign billionaire Wafic Said, who is legally barred from donating to UK political parties, as a "donor" in logs from his meetings with then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. While his wife, a British citizen, has donated millions to the Conservatives, the logs show Mr. Said having multiple political calls and a lengthy meeting with Johnson without her present. This evidence raises serious questions about whether the Conservative Party illegally accepted funds from a foreign national, contravening UK electoral law.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Ketogenic Diet May Reduce Symptoms of Depression</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Ohio State University conducted a study finding that a well-formulated ketogenic diet may significantly reduce symptoms of depression. In a pilot trial involving 16 students already receiving treatment for major depressive disorder, participants experienced an average 70% decrease in depression symptoms after at least 10 weeks on the diet. The researchers suggest that achieving nutritional ketosis could serve as an adjunctive therapy for depression, possibly due to the anti-inflammatory properties of ketones and their impact on brain function, warranting a larger clinical trial.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Frontiers in Marine Science reveals that meat from endangered and critically endangered shark species is being sold in the U.S. under ambiguous or incorrect labels. Researchers used DNA barcoding on 29 shark products from stores and online, finding species like the great hammerhead and scalloped hammerhead. The mislabeling not only threatens vulnerable shark populations but also poses health risks to consumers, as some of these species contain high levels of toxins like mercury and arsenic.</p>

          <p>Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer has secured its first U.S. sale for its newer E2 jet family with a 50-plane order from startup carrier Avelo Airlines. The deal, which includes options for 50 additional aircraft, is for the E195-E2 model, a fuel-efficient regional jet. This significant order will allow Avelo to modernize its fleet and represents a major breakthrough for Embraer, which has faced stiff competition from rivals like the Airbus A220 in this market segment.</p>

          <p>The average cost for consumers to withdraw cash from an out-of-network ATM has climbed to a record high of $4.86, according to a new survey from Bankrate.com. This total fee includes charges from both the ATM owner and the customer's own bank, with the latter's fee increasing by nearly 4% since last year. Experts suggest that with declining cash usage, banks are increasing these unregulated fees on non-customers as a way to generate revenue without alienating their own client base.</p>

          <p>Natural cosmetics brand Weleda has launched a new investigation into its historical ties to the Nazi regime following claims it was connected to the Dachau concentration camp. A report by a historian alleges the company sourced raw materials from a garden at the camp and that an anti-freeze cream it produced was used by an SS doctor in horrific human experiments on prisoners. Weleda has acknowledged these findings may not have been fully explored in previous research and has committed to a complete reappraisal of its history.</p>

          <p>Organizers of this month's Ryder Cup at Bethpage have reportedly asked President Donald Trump to delay his arrival on the first day of the event to avoid security and logistical chaos. The request stems from concerns about a repeat of the delays experienced at the U.S. Open tennis final, where enhanced security for the president's visit caused long queues for spectators. With a daily attendance of around 50,000, officials hope a later arrival will ensure play can begin on time without disrupting the large crowds.</p>
