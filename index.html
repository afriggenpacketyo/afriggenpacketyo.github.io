          <p>A 36-year-old California woman who became lost in a Michigan state forest while participating in a YouTube survival challenge was successfully located and rescued. The contestant was reported missing early Saturday morning after getting lost the previous evening in the Pigeon River State Forest. After an initial search with canines, a Michigan State Police helicopter crew spotted the woman using the aircraft's thermal imaging camera. Law enforcement and firefighters were then able to guide her safely out of the dense woods, bringing the search to a positive conclusion.</p>

          <p>England's football manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his intention to integrate long throw-ins and long-ball tactics into the team's strategy for the upcoming World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying run, which has featured a lower percentage of long balls compared to previous tournaments, Tuchel believes these direct tactics will be crucial on the world stage. He acknowledged the limited training time available but emphasized that set-pieces like long throws will matter significantly during the tournament. The German manager plans to work on these strategic elements with his players during the remaining international breaks before the World Cup.</p>

          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully bypassed Israeli air defenses and struck the Ramon International Airport near Eilat. The attack caused material damage to the passenger terminal, including shattered windows, and resulted in one man receiving treatment for light shrapnel wounds. While the Israeli military intercepted most of the drones in the barrage, this one marked a significant breach. The Houthis claimed responsibility, calling it a 'qualitative military operation' and warning foreigners to leave Israeli airports, though Ramon Airport resumed normal operations within a few hours.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open men's finals in New York, his first appearance at the event in a decade. Seated in a luxury suite, his presence drew a mixed reaction from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium, with reports of both cheers and boos when he was shown on the stadium screens. This visit marks a return for Trump, who was a regular attendee before his political career. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid focusing on off-court disruptions related to his attendance, a standard practice for the organization to maintain focus on the match.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the U.S. Treasury could be forced to issue refunds totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion if the Supreme Court strikes down tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. This follows a federal appeals court ruling that found many of the 'reciprocal tariffs' to be illegal, prompting the administration to request an expedited hearing from the high court. While Bessent expressed confidence that the administration's position will prevail, he acknowledged the significant financial disruption a negative ruling would cause. The administration is also reportedly preparing alternative plans, such as using other legal authorities to implement sector-specific levies if the current tariffs are voided.

          <p>Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth condemned President Trump's recent social media posts about Chicago, stating he 'essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation.' Her comments follow a post from Trump suggesting Chicago would soon understand why the Department of Defense was renamed the 'Department of War.' Despite the aggressive rhetoric, Duckworth noted there are currently no indications of an imminent troop deployment into the city. She emphasized that such an order would be illegal and that the administration has not coordinated with local law enforcement, suggesting a lack of genuine interest in fighting crime.</p>

          <p>At the Italian Grand Prix, McLaren instructed driver Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place, creating a significant controversy in their intra-team title fight. Norris had been running ahead of Piastri for most of the race until a slow pit stop, caused by a team equipment fault, dropped him behind his teammate. Citing team principles of fairness and a similar situation in a previous race, McLaren ordered the positions to be reverted. While Piastri initially questioned the decision on the radio, he complied, and both drivers later publicly supported the team's commitment to its internal racing values.</p>

          <p>Despite advancements in aviation, most aircraft used for storm chasing and weather tracking, such as the NOAA's Hurricane Hunters, still rely on turboprop engines rather than jets. Turboprops are better suited for this work because they can fly slower and lower, maximizing the time spent inside a storm to gather crucial data. Their engines are also more efficient at these lower altitudes, and their ability to use shorter runways provides greater operational flexibility in remote areas. These advantages ensure that propeller-driven aircraft remain the gold standard for meteorological reconnaissance, especially as extreme weather events become more frequent.</p>

          <p>U.S. authorities are investigating a malicious email, disguised as correspondence from a Republican congressman, that was sent to individuals and groups involved in U.S.-China trade policy. The email contained malware linked by cybersecurity analysts to APT41, a hacking group believed to be associated with Chinese intelligence. The apparent goal of the cyberattack was to gain insight into the Trump administration's strategies and recommendations for the contentious trade talks with Beijing. The email reportedly asked recipients to review a piece of proposed legislation attached to the message, which served as the delivery mechanism for the malware.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The demonstrations, among the largest in recent months, included families of the 48 hostages still in captivity, who expressed anger and fear that an expanded military offensive will further endanger their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, the Israeli government has shown no signs of halting its campaign, vowing to achieve 'total victory' over Hamas and preparing for a potential ground incursion into Gaza City.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of more military sites to accommodate asylum seekers as part of its plan to move them out of hotels. Officials are also considering other 'non-military' types of accommodation to address the issue, which has become a source of public protest. Currently, just over 32,000 asylum seekers are housed in hotels, and the Labour government aims to accelerate the process of ending this costly practice. Two former military bases are already in use, and reports suggest the Home Office will announce proposals to expand this program within weeks.</p>

Meanwhile, Apple is expected to unveil its iPhone 17 lineup on Tuesday, with analysts watching for any price increases that could boost the company's sluggish revenue growth. These events will test the market's current optimism regarding both monetary policy and the tech sector's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who chairs the homeland security committee, condemned Vice President JD Vance's recent comments supporting a U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers. Vance had posted that 'killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.' Paul called this sentiment 'despicable and thoughtless,' arguing that it glorifies executing accused individuals without a trial or due process. The exchange highlights a sharp division within the Republican party over the administration's new policy of using military force against international cartels.</p>

The alert, which included a message clarifying it was a drill, sounded for about 10 seconds and was deemed a success by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The test caused brief pauses at public events, including a Rugby World Cup match and an England cricket game, to avoid disruption.
