          <p>A new effort in Brooklyn is reshaping inclusion in Jewish matchmaking, focusing on connecting individuals with physical disabilities who are seeking love and family. Therapist Eli Portal, who was paralyzed after an accident, partnered with matchmaker Rivkah Fox to create events that look beyond physical appearance and connect people on a deeper level. Chaim Lebowitz, who has worked with a traditional matchmaker, hopes to meet someone at the event in Brooklyn, seeking a partner who values personality and shared goals over physical conditions. Avrumi and Chani Lunger, who both have physical disabilities, emphasize the importance of networking and finding others with similar experiences to foster understanding and empathy.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone. The diagnosis came after he reported urinary symptoms, leading doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, including President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris, have extended their well wishes to Biden and his family, expressing hope for his speedy recovery, as did former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen approved a deal, halting a three-day work stoppage that disrupted commutes across the state. The agreement was reached after negotiations regarding pay parity with neighboring transit agencies and the rising cost of living. While the terms of the deal were not immediately available, NJ Transit announced that trains would resume service on Tuesday morning to allow for equipment inspections. The previous strike in 1983 lasted three weeks, with a potential strike averted in 2016 just a day before it was scheduled to begin.</p>

Rahm's dreams of a third major triumph were crushed on the 'Green Mile' finale, leading to a tie of eighth place.

          <p>Russia targeted Ukraine with a large drone bombardment, which Ukrainian officials said mostly targeted Kyiv, just a day before President Trump was expected to talk with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Ukrainian officials have argued that Russia’s relentless bombardments, like the drone attacks, are evidence that Mr. Putin does not want to find a path to peace. The call between Mr. Trump and the Russian leader, which the Kremlin confirmed, would be their second publicly acknowledged conversation over Ukraine since Mr. Trump took office in January. The Ukrainian Air Force said that 88 drones were intercepted, while 128 others vanished from radars, and a 28-year-old woman in the capital region was killed and three more people were injured, including a 4-year-old child.</p>

          <p>Tony Gonsolin struggled with a bloody hand as the Angels completed a three-game sweep of the Dodgers with a 6-4 victory. The Dodgers rallied from a 4-0 deficit, but a banged-up bullpen gave the Angels the lead right back, with Travis d’Arnaud going deep in the eighth against Anthony Banda. Manager Andrew Friedman acknowledged the team's pitching woes due to injuries, emphasizing the challenge of maintaining pitching depth. The Dodgers' injury problems have led to an unsustainable workload for the bullpen, and the team ranks 21st in the majors with a 4.22 team ERA.</p>

Dan's victory, securing 55% of the vote, was particularly strong in Romania, though Simion led among diaspora voters. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and proposed cutting aid to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>After bidding farewell to Bayern Munich, legendary footballer Thomas Müller hinted at a potential move to the Major League Soccer (MLS) team, LAFC. When asked directly if he was going to Los Angeles, Müller responded with an effusive, “uno nunca sabe” (you never know). This response has raised hopes among LAFC fans that he might join other European stars in the MLS. Müller could potentially join French stars Olivier Giroud and Hugo Lloris, as well as Turkish star Cengiz Under.</p>
