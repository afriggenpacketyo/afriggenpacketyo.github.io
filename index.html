The company is considering a buyout offer from Couche-Tard, while also exploring a go-it-alone strategy to maximize shareholder value.

          <p>A new rule requiring teams to use three sets of tires during the Monaco Grand Prix aimed to increase strategic options, however, it had little impact on the race's outcome. While some, like McLaren's Andrea Stella, found the rule change interesting due to the variety of scenarios it created, others felt it led to teams strategically manipulating driver positions. Williams' Alex Albon apologized for the "bad show" resulting from the rule, and Max Verstappen criticized the artificiality of the change, suggesting the fundamental issue is the track's inherent difficulty in overtaking. The rule also made it easier to exploit F1's controversial red-flag tire-change rule, further complicating the race.</p>

          <p>The diamond industry is facing challenges from multiple fronts, including potential U.S. tariffs, slowing demand, and competition from lab-grown diamonds (LGDs). The industry is susceptible to trade disruptions due to its complex supply chains, and tariffs could further strain the sector. The rise of LGDs, which are chemically identical to mined diamonds but sold at a significant discount, is disrupting the market. Despite these challenges, some analysts believe the industry is nearing a stabilization point between LGDs and mined diamonds, with De Beers doubling down on natural diamonds.

          <p>Tesla's European sales have significantly declined, dropping by 52% in April, despite the growing demand for electric vehicles in the region. In the first four months of the year, Tesla's sales decreased by 46.1% compared to the previous year, while Chinese manufacturer BYD surpassed Tesla in pure electric car registrations in April. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as the slow rollout of the latest Model Y version and Elon Musk's involvement with Donald Trump's administration.

          <p>Italian filmmaker Silvio Soldini's "The Tasters" draws inspiration from the story of Margot WÃ¶lk, who claimed to be one of Hitler's food tasters, but historians have questioned the veracity of her account. The film, based on Rosella Postorino's novel, portrays the experiences of women forcibly recruited to taste Hitler's food, fearing it could be poisoned. While the film reflects the recruitment and daily schedule described by WÃ¶lk, historian Sven-Felix Kellerhoff argues that Hitler's dietary habits in his final years make the story unlikely. Soldini acknowledges the historical inaccuracies, emphasizing that the film is based on the novel, not a true story, but finds relevance in its portrayal of political violence.</p>

This trend reflects a preference for physical gold bars over paper assets to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks.

ARBD affects a person's ability to perform daily tasks, and the stigma and lack of awareness contribute to missed or misdiagnosed cases. A Welsh government representative stated that Â£67m is being invested to help people affected by drugs and alcohol, including ARBD.

          <p>Hong Kong is increasing efforts to become an international data-trading hub by establishing connections with mainland China and Southeast Asia, as cross-border data sharing is a new engine of an AI-driven economy, according to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po. The government is committed to opening and sharing data for use by the private sector and academia, with its open data portal offering over 5,600 data sets. The value of data is immense, and the government's Commercial Data Interchange has processed over 20 million data exchanges, enabling faster credit assessments.</p>

          <h2>Leaked Recording Reveals Police Concerns Over Abortion Arrest</h2>

          <p>A leaked recording reveals that a senior police officer had serious concerns about the arrest of Nicola Packer, who took abortion pills when about 26 weeks pregnant. Packer was arrested in hospital after delivering a stillborn baby at home and later charged with having an illegal abortion, but was acquitted. The recording captures the police officer questioning whether the arrest was "the best for Nicola" and expressing discomfort with police operating in areas related to abortions. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has released guidance reminding healthcare professionals that it is never in the public interest to report women to the police who may have terminated pregnancies illegally.</p>
