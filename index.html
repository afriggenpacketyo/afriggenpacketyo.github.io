Both conservative and liberal candidates are hesitant to champion feminist agendas, fearing a backlash from men who feel they face reverse discrimination.

          <p>President Trump has stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. He emphasized that the deal involves an investment and partial ownership but that the company will be controlled by the United States. Trump highlighted that the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and provide a $14 billion boost to the economy. The President's approval followed a review by federal agencies, though details of the potential acquisition scheme remain undisclosed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump will delay his threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US, after what he described as a “very nice call” with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen wrote that she had a “Good call with POTUS” in a social media post announcing she had secured a tariff delay of more than a month, to 9 July, to give both sides more time to negotiate. The decision marks a U-turn since Friday, when Trump warned he would impose the 50% tariffs on 1 June because discussions with the EU were “going nowhere”.</p>

He emphasizes that focusing on employment and debt control would be more beneficial than pursuing a higher growth rate.

          <p>A Chinese military magazine article suggests that Beijing could cripple Taiwan by targeting key infrastructure nodes, leading to a systemic collapse. The article identifies 30 to 40 "super critical" targets, including liquefied natural gas facilities, which could disrupt essential services like electricity and water. This "urban collapse warfare" tactic could potentially undermine Taiwan's will to resist and create conditions for a "win without fighting." Taiwan's reliance on imported resources and vulnerability to natural disasters make it susceptible to such a strategy.</p>
