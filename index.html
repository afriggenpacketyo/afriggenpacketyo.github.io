          <p>The Republican-led House passed President Trump's tax bill, a key component of his legislative agenda, by a narrow margin of 215-214. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, slashes Medicaid funding, and includes provisions to eliminate taxes on tips. The bill also makes adjustments to deductions for state and local taxes (SALT), increasing the cap to $40,000 for those earning under $500,000, a concession to blue-state Republicans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will disproportionately benefit higher-income households, while markets reacted negatively due to concerns about increasing federal deficits. </p>

          <p>A Westminster police officer, Nicole Brown, has been charged with 15 felonies for allegedly collecting over $600,000 in workers' compensation for a faked head injury.

The investigation began after reports of Brown "dancing and drinking" at the Stagecoach Music Festival. Brown's attorney claims she suffered a significant head injury and intends to fight the allegations, while her stepfather faces charges for his involvement in the alleged fraud. </p>

          <p>In a bruising Oval Office meeting, South Africaâ€™s President Cyril Ramaphosa's efforts to reset relations with President Trump backfired when Trump focused on false accusations of white genocide in South Africa. Trump presented video clips of a firebrand leftist South African politician calling for violence against Afrikaners. Ramaphosa's attempts to steer the conversation toward trade and economic ties were largely drowned out. Despite the contentious meeting, Ramaphosa claimed success in presenting a framework for a trade deal, though significant work remains to repair relations with the United States. </p>

The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using the base for 99 years, with payments from the British taxpayer to Mauritius expected to reach billions.

Most Nike shoes costing over $100 will see price increases of up to $10, while clothing and equipment will rise by $2 to $10. Nike's finance chief previously noted the company was navigating external factors, including tariffs, that create uncertainty. </p>

The bill demolishes key components of climate legislation, ending tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. Energy Innovation estimates that household energy bills could rise by $230 by 2035, and the US could emit 260 million tonnes more pollution. Ted Fertik of Blue Green Alliance calls the bill a direct attack on working Americans, while Republicans argue it is necessary to cut wasteful spending. </p>

          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing figures in the UK have increased the likelihood of Chancellor Rachel Reeves raising taxes in the autumn. Borrowing in April was Â£20.2 billion, up Â£1 billion from the same month last year. Experts suggest that Reeves may struggle to meet her spending and borrowing rules, making tax rises "inevitable." Plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments and increased defense spending will further increase pressure for tax rises. </p>

The judge did not order the return of the deportees but required the government to conduct interviews to determine if they have a reasonable fear of being deported to South Sudan. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling. The court outlined requirements for the interviews, including access to lawyers and interpreters. </p>

Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability.
