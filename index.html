          <p>Political infighting has led Germany's Bundestag to postpone the appointment of three new Federal Constitutional Court judges. The delay was initiated after the conservative CDU/CSU bloc raised plagiarism concerns about a candidate nominated by their coalition partner, the SPD, who they also viewed as too liberal. This move prompted the Green party to demand a postponement for all three candidates to protect the court's integrity, highlighting deep divisions within the ruling coalition.</p>

          <p>The Unite union has suspended the membership of UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner amid a contentious dispute over long-running bin strikes in Birmingham. Rayner had been encouraging the striking workers to accept a deal, a position that put her at odds with the union. As a major financial backer of the Labour Party and Rayner herself, the union's decision signals a significant and deepening rift between organized labor and the government.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high, exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which also propelled other cryptocurrencies like Ether higher. The rally was further fueled by a wave of short liquidations and speculation about a more dovish future stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is undergoing a significant overhaul, cutting its Washington-based workforce by approximately 15% and eliminating 132 offices. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is spearheading the reorganization, arguing it is necessary to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and accelerate decision-making processes. However, former diplomats have criticized the move as an "act of vandalism," warning that the deep cuts will gut the department's institutional knowledge and diminish U.S. global influence.</p>

          <p>Investigators in the Philippines may have made a significant breakthrough in the case of dozens of people who mysteriously disappeared in 2022. Search teams recovered a bag containing what appear to be burned human bones from Lake Taal, south of Manila. The search was initiated after a witness claimed that as many as 100 people involved in the online cockfighting industry were murdered by rogue police officers and their bodies submerged in the lake. Fifteen police officers are currently under investigation in connection with the disappearances.</p>
