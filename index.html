            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelan detainees held in north Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law invoked by the Trump administration. The court order prevents their removal until further notice, responding to concerns raised by the ACLU that these individuals were at imminent risk of deportation to El Salvador without due process. The ACLU argued that the detainees were being accused of gang membership without sufficient opportunity to contest the designation in court, potentially leading to life sentences in a brutal Salvadoran prison. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.</p>

            <p>In a groundbreaking event, dozens of humanoid robots participated in a half-marathon in Beijing alongside human runners, showcasing China's advancements in robotics technology. The 21km race featured robots of various sizes and capabilities, with some teams allowed to change batteries or substitute robots during the event. While the robots demonstrated technological progress, they were ultimately outpaced by their human counterparts, highlighting the current gap in performance between human and robotic endurance. This event was billed as a test of bipedal robots in real-world conditions.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's policies toward foreigners build on El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's iron fist crackdown against criminal gangs, leveraging anti-establishment anger to justify an authoritarian slide. Bukele's visit to Washington DC showcased the alliance: the internationalisation of the Bukele method. The author suggests that Trump's real innovation has been to outsource the most egregious parts of his immigration crackdown, both to the private sector and to foreign actors and sites. The case of Kilmar Ábrego García illustrates the human cost of the emerging Bukele-Trump method, as both leaders claim that Abrego García’s release from the prison is beyond their control, while this is calculated to instil terror.</p>

He also urges Merz's future government to provide a substantial portion of the German Air Force’s inventory to Ukraine to maximize the effectiveness of the Taurus system.

            <p>Economists are raising concerns that Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports could lead to corporate profiteering, as companies use the tariffs as justification to raise prices beyond the actual cost increases. Experts point to past examples, such as tariffs on washing machines, where domestic manufacturers also raised prices on non-tariffed goods. While the Trump administration warns against price-fixing, analysts suggest that companies may take the opportunity to increase profit margins or market share amid rising inflation expectations. The impact of these tariffs is expected to disproportionately affect US consumers, potentially leading to a significant increase in household expenses (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>A poll by the NASUWT teaching union reveals that social media influencers, particularly Andrew Tate, are contributing to a rise in misogyny and sexism in UK schools. Almost three in five teachers believe social media use has negatively impacted behavior, with some students adopting misogynistic views and refusing to engage with female teachers. The Department for Education acknowledges the damaging impact of dangerous influencers and is supporting teachers in addressing the issue. Union members will debate motions at their annual conference to address the influence of far-right and populist movements on social media.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump posted an image on Truth Social that appears to be digitally altered, claiming it shows the hand of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador, with MS-13 tattoos. Trump asserted this as evidence that Abrego Garcia is a gang member, despite courts not having made such a finding. Social media users have questioned the authenticity of the image, suggesting it was Photoshopped. The post follows a visit by Senator Chris Van Hollen to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, whose deportation has been contested by courts.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members under a wartime law. The ACLU argued the men were at risk of imminent removal to an El Salvadoran prison. The court order prevents the removal of any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of the Court. The Trump administration flew hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants deemed members of Tren de Aragua last month to El Salvador, where they are being held in a notorious mega-prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center.</p>

A Maryland man who the Trump administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador has been moved to a new prison, US Senator Chris Van Hollen has said. The Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar Ábrego García, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month. Mr Ábrego García was "traumatised" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the facility, Van Hollen said, adding that he was moved to another facility in the country over a week ago.</p>
