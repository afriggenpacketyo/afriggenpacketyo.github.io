          <p>The UK government has announced that police will be given broader powers to manage and place conditions on recurring protests. Senior officers will be able to consider the "cumulative impact" of demonstrations, potentially requiring organizers to change locations if a site has been used repeatedly. This move comes in the wake of nearly 500 arrests during pro-Palestine protests and heightened community tensions following a deadly attack at a synagogue. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the goal is to balance the fundamental right to protest with the public's right to live without fear and intimidation.</p>

          <p>Intense overnight Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine have resulted in at least five deaths and left tens of thousands without electricity. The attacks targeted infrastructure in multiple regions, with the western city of Lviv being heavily impacted. In response to the heightened military activity near its border, Poland scrambled its own fighter jets as a precautionary measure to secure its airspace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reiterated his urgent call for more advanced air defense systems from allies to counter Russia's aerial terror campaign.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has urged for a calm and sober response to numerous drone sightings over airports and military sites, while confirming that efforts to enhance drone defense are progressing. The statement follows significant disruptions at Munich Airport, which was closed twice due to drone activity, affecting thousands of passengers. Officials suspect the overflights may be part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy intended to provoke fear and create uncertainty. The incidents have prompted calls for a joint federal and state drone defense center to be established.</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains in Nepal have triggered devastating landslides and flash floods, leading to the deaths of at least 22 people, with 12 others still missing. The eastern Ilam district was hit particularly hard, where multiple villages were swept away and a single family of six was buried in their home. Rescue operations are underway, with 114 people saved so far, but are being hampered by continuous rainfall and blocked roads. The severe weather has also disrupted domestic flights and shut down major highways connecting the capital, Kathmandu, to the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections since the fall of longtime leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a direct popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210 seats in the People's Assembly will be chosen by electoral colleges, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president. The elections are viewed as a key indicator of the new authorities' commitment to inclusivity for women and minorities. However, the process has drawn criticism for a lack of transparency and the indefinite postponement of voting in Kurdish-controlled and Druze-majority regions.</p>

          <p>The electric vehicle market in the United States is poised for a slowdown despite recent record sales, as a key federal tax credit of up to $7,500 has expired. Analysts suggest the recent sales surge was artificially inflated by buyers rushing to take advantage of the subsidy before it ended. The U.S. continues to lag behind Europe and China in EV adoption, hindered by weaker government support, higher vehicle prices, and the effective exclusion of low-cost Chinese brands due to tariffs. Automakers like Ford and GM now anticipate a significant drop in consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>
