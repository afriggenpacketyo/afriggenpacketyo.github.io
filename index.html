          <p>An opinion piece argues that intense media focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case is overshadowing more critical long-term issues. The article highlights four specific areas demanding greater attention: the escalating U.S. national debt, a resurgent global hunger crisis, the worldwide population slowdown and its economic consequences, and the degradation of America's military readiness in the face of new geopolitical threats. It suggests these complex, systemic problems will have far more significant future impacts.</p>

          <p>Overnight aerial assaults between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in at least four deaths, with two fatalities reported in each country. Ukrainian officials stated that the Dnipro and Sumy regions were hit by rockets and drones, causing casualties and damaging infrastructure, including a shopping center. Concurrently, Russian authorities reported that Ukrainian drone attacks targeted multiple regions, including Rostov, where two people were killed. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have downed 54 Ukrainian drones across several areas.</p>

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, with many casualties occurring as people waited for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. This event unfolds as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have reportedly stalled, heightening the humanitarian crisis. The United Nations has warned of famine conditions in Gaza, citing Israeli military restrictions and looting as major impediments to aid delivery. International pressure is mounting on Israel to alleviate the suffering and facilitate aid.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Justice Department against the city's sanctuary policies. The lawsuit alleged that Chicago's ordinances, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, unlawfully interfere with federal enforcement. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins, a Biden appointee, ruled that the policies are lawful and do not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, affirming states' rights under the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor praised the decision as a victory for public safety and the city's welcoming stance.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams humorously remarked she returned to competition for the health insurance benefits, highlighting a challenge many Americans face. The article explains how the U.S. system ties insurance to employment, making breaks from work, like Williams took, financially precarious due to high COBRA costs. It notes her personal health needs, including Sjogren's syndrome, and explains how the Affordable Care Act has improved options for those with pre-existing conditions. The piece uses her situation to illustrate the broader complexities and "job lock" associated with the American healthcare model.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the country's situation has deteriorated, according to analysts. The ruling junta, which cited insecurity and economic woes as justification for the takeover, has overseen a period of increased instability and job losses, particularly in the non-profit sector. The regime has also cracked down on dissent, media, and civil society, drawing criticism from human rights organizations. With the junta leader being sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a swift return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly unlikely.</p>

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of "summer depression," or summer-pattern seasonal affective disorder (SAD), suggesting it may be worsening due to climate change. As extreme heat forces more people indoors into air-conditioned environments, they miss out on sunlight, social interaction, and outdoor exercise, which are crucial for mental well-being. This avoidance of heat can mimic the conditions that cause winter SAD, leading to symptoms like low energy and sadness. The piece argues that America's choice between enduring dangerous heat outside or isolating indoors presents a growing mental health challenge.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pursuing a policy of direct government investment in private companies, a level of state intervention rarely seen outside of war or major crises. This includes President Trump personally holding a "golden share" in U.S. Steel following its merger with Nippon Steel, giving him veto power over major decisions. Additionally, the Department of Defense purchased a $400 million equity stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials. This strategy is framed as a way to secure national supply chains against Chinese dominance but is viewed by some experts as a market-distorting move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, an American comedian living in Scotland expresses her frustration with Donald Trump's visit to the country. She reflects on Trump's desperate need for Scottish acceptance, comparing it to the common ancestry claims of other American tourists. The author argues that despite his Scottish heritage, his persona is fundamentally at odds with Scottish culture and values. She invokes the memory of the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley's famous protest, suggesting that blunt, humorous defiance is the most appropriate response to a figure who she feels will never truly belong.</p>

The author describes the deal not as regulation but as an "extortion scheme" that sacrifices university principles to appease political pressure.

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is fueling speculation about the viability of the entire late-night television format. While the network cited financial reasons amid a challenging media landscape, the timing has raised questions, as it followed Colbert's criticism of a Paramount settlement with Donald Trump. The article notes that all late-night shows face declining linear TV ratings and rising production costs, forcing media companies to re-evaluate their programming. The future of other shows, like ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," will be a key indicator of the genre's direction.</p>

          <p>A proposed federal bill, the Captive Primate Safety Act, aims to address the brutal industry of primate pet ownership by making private ownership and breeding illegal across all 50 states. Animal welfare experts explain that the trade begins with poachers killing adult monkeys to steal their babies, who then often suffer from trauma, malnutrition, and illness in captivity. The Oakland Zoo, which recently rescued a smuggled spider monkey, is part of a coalition lobbying for the bill. They argue it is a crucial step to protect primates and end the suffering caused by this trade.</p>

          <p>A significant number of high-earning Americans, sometimes called "HENRYs" (high earners, not rich yet), report living paycheck to paycheck and struggling with debt despite their six-figure incomes. Experts attribute this to rising costs, existing debt, and "lifestyle creep," where spending increases to match income. Psychologists note that the feeling of wealth comes from spending, not just earning, creating a paradox for those focused on accumulation. This financial anxiety is widespread, with surveys showing what people believe they need to earn to feel rich is often far higher than their current salary.</p>
