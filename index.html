          <p>A Broward County, Florida, circuit court judge, Gary Farmer, has been suspended without pay after an advisory panel found him unfit due to inappropriate jokes, bias, and poor attendance. The investigation revealed instances where Farmer made remarks considered offensive, including mocking a defendant expecting multiple children and referencing an "In Living Color" comedy sketch making fun of gay people. Farmer's attorney admitted he made the jokes to lighten tension but acknowledged they were inappropriate. The Florida Supreme Court's commission suspended Farmer following the recommendation from the FJQC.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Missouri have approved a new referendum seeking to repeal the abortion-rights amendment approved by voters last year, instead favoring a ban on most abortions with exceptions for sexual assault and incest. The proposed constitutional amendment will go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner if the governor calls a special election. This move follows the approval of an amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability in November 2024. The new measure would allow abortions only for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, or in cases of sexual assault or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>

          <p>Rosa Chang, a Korean-born artist, is teaching Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) students the art of indigo and natural dyes, a centuries-old tradition. Her class, "Mindful Colors: Natural Dyes from Korea and Beyond," explores the relationship between color and nature, using plants like indigo and marigold to create various hues. Chang became involved in natural dyes after growing tired of the fashion industry's toxic fabrics. Students appreciate learning about the historical process and sustainability of natural dyes, which they plan to incorporate into their art or hobbies. Chang's children's book, "My Indigo World," shares the science and history behind Korean indigo dye.</p>

          <p>Becky Hill, the former court clerk who handled the trial of Alex Murdaugh, has been arrested and charged with misconduct in office, obstruction of justice, and perjury. Prosecutors allege that Hill misused her position for personal gain, shared sealed court information with a reporter, and committed perjury. Murdaugh's lawyers had previously requested a new trial, arguing that Hill improperly influenced the jurors, though the request was initially denied. The allegations stem from inappropriate conversations with jurors and the publication of a book about the trial, which Hill later admitted contained plagiarized portions.</p>

          <p>A British maritime authority's preliminary investigation found that the Bayesian superyacht, which sank off Sicily last year killing seven, likely capsized due to an intense gust of wind. The report noted that the yacht's towering single mast increased its vulnerability to capsizing in high winds. A young deckhand's delay in waking the captain, instead posting a video of the storm on social media, contributed to the rapid catastrophe. The investigation also found that the boat's "angle of vanishing stability" was less than many sailboats, and that the operating manual lacked critical data.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of justice, escalating a clash between the Trump administration and local authorities over immigration enforcement. The charges stem from an incident where Dugan allegedly misdirected federal agents away from a person in her court who is in the U.S. illegally. Dugan's attorneys argue she is entitled to judicial immunity and insist she is innocent. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench pending the outcome of the case.</p>
