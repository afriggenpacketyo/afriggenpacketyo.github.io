            <p>The Chinese navy stated it expelled a Philippine warship that it claimed entered waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, just hours before the start of joint military exercises between the US and the Philippines. China claims the shoal, known as Huangyan Island in China and Panatag Shoal in the Philippines, has been under its control since 2012. The Philippines maintains its sovereignty claim and asserts its right to challenge any ship within its maritime zones, escalating tensions in the region amid ongoing territorial disputes.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about a pending attack on Houthis in Yemen in a second Signal group chat that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The information shared included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in the operation. This revelation follows reports of a previous Signal chat where sensitive military information was discussed, raising concerns about potential security breaches and classified information handling. Critics argue that sharing such details over unapproved channels could endanger troops, while the Pentagon maintains no classified information was compromised and that the focus remains on executing President Trump's agenda. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app.</p>

            <p>Alan Shearer discusses the unpredictable nature of the Premier League's top-five race, highlighting that the varying priorities of teams towards the end of the season make predictions difficult. He notes that upcoming matches for Chelsea and Newcastle against Liverpool and Arsenal, respectively, could be influenced by those teams' potential Champions League or Premier League title pursuits. Shearer also points out that the Europa League focus for Manchester United and Tottenham could impact their league performance. Despite this, he considers Chelsea's remaining fixtures among the toughest due to away games against rivals, emphasizing the importance of their recent win against Fulham.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>As the U.S. tightens restrictions on Nvidia's chip sales to China, domestic AI chipmakers like Huawei and Cambricon Technologies are poised to benefit. The Commerce Department's new export license requirements for Nvidia's H20 GPUs and additional AMD chips create an opportunity for local competitors to grow and improve their solutions. While Huawei's Ascend series is gaining traction, analysts note that export controls also hinder China's ability to produce advanced GPUs at the same scale as Nvidia, due to reliance on domestic foundries facing their own equipment restrictions. However, stockpiles and previous exemptions may limit the short-term impact of the controls, providing Chinese chipmakers more time to scale up production.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned other countries against entering into trade agreements with the United States that could negatively impact China's interests. This warning comes after President Trump announced tariffs against numerous trading partners, some of whom have begun negotiations with Washington. China's Commerce Ministry stated it would firmly oppose any deal made at China's expense and would take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry criticized the U.S. tariffs as economic bullying and emphasized that appeasement would not bring peace, signaling a firm stance against U.S. trade policies.</p>

            <p>With the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) set to expire in September, African nations are concerned about the potential economic impact if the trade agreement is not renewed. AGOA provides duty-free access to the US market for eligible sub-Saharan African countries, and its termination could lead to job losses, increased commodity prices, and higher business costs. Experts suggest Africa should focus on luxury products and leverage platforms like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to strengthen its economic future.

Concerns have been raised about the inadequacy of current tactical options, as officers only carry extendable batons and incapacitant spray. The POA is also renewing calls for all staff to have stab vests and for American "Supermax"-style rules to be imposed on the UK's most dangerous inmates.</p>

However, a spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) dismissed the report as invalid, while a UN official suggested the investigation did not go far enough.

Without congressional action to provide additional funding, this could lead to a significant increase in evictions and push vulnerable individuals back onto the streets or into abusive situations.

            <p>A recent survey indicates that China's job market for PhD graduates, especially in postdoctoral positions, is significantly more favorable compared to the US. The study found that the supply of postdoctoral positions at Chinese universities far exceeds the number of job seekers, with only one applicant for every five vacancies. This trend is attracting high-profile scientists, including those who worked at MIT, to return to China, particularly as research funding in the US faces cuts.</p>

            <p>Gatwick Airport has been identified as the UK's worst airport for flight delays for the second consecutive year, with departures averaging over 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024. The airport attributes the delays to air traffic control (ATC) disruptions in Europe and within its own control tower. Despite improvements from the previous year, Gatwick's punctuality record remains the poorest in the UK, while Belfast City Airport recorded the best performance. The airport says it is putting plans in place to improve on-time performance further in 2025.</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing are removing U.S. beef from their menus due to tariffs imposed as a result of the trade war between the United States and China. The increased tariffs have made U.S. beef unaffordable, prompting restaurants to switch to alternative sources like Australian beef. This shift reflects the broader impact of the trade war on businesses and consumers, as the disappearance of U.S. beef from menus signals a potential fate for thousands of other goods.</p>

Under the plea deal, he would receive a life sentence with no possibility of parole, a decision driven by the majority of victims' relatives who want the case to be concluded.
