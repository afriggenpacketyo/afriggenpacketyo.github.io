        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant monthly drop since last October. This decline highlights challenges in boosting enterprise profitability despite government stimulus efforts, with the statistics bureau citing insufficient domestic demand and lower industrial product prices as key factors. While retail sales saw some growth, this did not translate to higher business profits due to a deepening price war and depressed price levels. Economists are now debating whether this downturn will prompt further government intervention or if Beijing will wait for more signs of economic stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of Keir Starmer's first year as UK Prime Minister reveals a term defined by early crises and internal political struggles. Despite a landslide election victory, his government faced immediate challenges, including a controversial decision to cut winter fuel payments and navigating the aftermath of mass riots. The article details tensions within his team, particularly regarding the role and subsequent dismissal of chief of staff Sue Gray. While Starmer has found a clearer narrative focusing on domestic and international security, his leadership faces a crucial test from within his own party over welfare reforms.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported that its global sales in May rose by 6.9 percent compared to the previous year, reaching a record high for the month with 898,721 units sold. The company attributed the strong performance largely to a surge in last-minute demand in the United States. This spike in sales was fueled by consumer concerns that car prices would soon increase due to high tariffs potentially being imposed by the U.S. government. In contrast to the sales record, Toyota's global production saw a slight dip of 0.7 percent, its first year-over-year decline in five months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 50th anniversary of a nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil is prompting renewed calls for its termination. Signed in 1975, the treaty aimed to build several nuclear power plants in Brazil but has been criticized for its high costs, limited success, and environmental risks. Critics, including Germany's Green Party, argue the deal is outdated and should be replaced with a focus on renewable energy partnerships. The debate is complicated by a global resurgence in nuclear power interest and recent geopolitical shifts involving Russia, which now has a uranium supply deal with Brazil.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has given a 23-year-old South Korean woman a three-year suspended prison sentence for injuring eight students in a hammer attack at Hosei University's Tama Campus. The judge acknowledged the dangerous and shocking nature of the attacks but attributed the woman's actions primarily to a mental disorder, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. The woman, who was a student at the university, had claimed she was bullied by some students, though the court found no evidence the victims were involved. The ruling considered her mental state a significant influencing factor in the violent incident.</p>

This move is a required precursor for companies planning to list on the mainland's A-share market. The decision comes as the A-share market shows signs of recovery in the second quarter, following a sluggish start to the year.

          <p>A new report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) reveals that organized criminal gangs are driving a dramatic increase in car thefts across the United Kingdom. Vehicle theft has risen 75% in the last decade, with sophisticated techniques allowing cars to be stolen and shipped out of the country within a day. This has evolved from opportunistic crime into a high-value international operation, costing the UK economy an estimated Â£1.77 billion annually and contributing to an 82% rise in car insurance premiums since 2021. The report stresses that both everyday models and luxury vehicles are targeted to supply illicit international markets.</p>

Families of the missing have received ransom demands, and in some cases, the victims have reported being taken outside of Syria. The United Nations is investigating the abductions, which have instilled a deep sense of fear in Alawite communities and raised concerns of targeted, sectarian violence and humiliation tactics against the former ruling sect.</p>

While the activists champion the ecological benefits of beavers, such as flood mitigation and water purification, the National Farmers Union expresses serious concerns about the unlicensed releases.

The compromise, which may cost Â£1.5 billion, was made to placate dozens of rebel MPs and avoid a defeat on the bill.

          <p>A UNESCO forum in Bangkok is working to build international support for its ethical guidelines on artificial intelligence. The UN agency's director general called for global collaboration to ensure AI serves the common good, as the technology rapidly transforms society. The event attracted government ministers and academics, primarily from the Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America, but major US and Chinese AI companies were notably absent. The forum takes place against a backdrop of intense US-China tech competition, with countries like Thailand stating they will remain neutral and focus on developing their own domestic AI ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law that cuts off certain public benefits for undocumented immigrants. The law, which takes effect July 1, impacts programs providing life-saving HIV/AIDS medication, communicable disease testing, and other public health services. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a doctor and four patients with HIV, argues the law is vague and contradicts federal statutes. It highlights the devastating health consequences for patients who will lose access to treatment, which not only endangers their lives but also increases the public health risk of HIV transmission.</p>

The execution has reignited debate over Japan's use of capital punishment, a practice supported by a majority of the public but criticized by international human rights groups.

          <p>Pennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman is facing increasing criticism from progressive members of his own party, who are frustrated with his staunch support for Israel and his willingness to cooperate with President Trump. This discontent has created an opening for his 2022 primary opponent, former U.S. Representative Conor Lamb, who has been actively appearing at town halls across the state. While Lamb says he is not currently running for office, his reemergence and pointed critiques of Fetterman are highlighting a significant rift within the party.

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, prominent economists argued that China must undergo structural reforms to transition from a production-based to a consumption-driven economy. They cautioned that without a significant increase in domestic consumption, China's reliance on exports could create trade friction not just with the US, but with the entire world. One expert suggested that China will never become a truly rich country unless it becomes a major consumer nation. The panel recommended that local governments should be measured on their success in boosting consumption, a shift that could harmonize global trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

During the lockdown, authorities conducted extensive searches, uncovering 169 weapons and 310 cellphones.

          <h2>Taiwan President's "Removing Impurities" Speech Condemned by Opposition as Authoritarian</h2>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai is facing harsh criticism from opposition lawmakers over a recent speech in which he compared Taiwan's democratic progress to forging steel and "removing all impurities." The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party condemned the remarks, interpreting them as a veiled threat to purge political dissent and push for the recall of dozens of their legislators. A KMT lawmaker likened the rhetoric to the "extreme ideological purity" of North Korea and called on citizens to reject what he termed Lai's "dictatorship." The speech has intensified political tensions between the ruling party and the opposition.</p>

          <p>The Santa Ynez Reservoir in Pacific Palisades, which was controversially empty and undergoing repairs during the destructive January firestorm, is now back online. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power announced the completion of lengthy repairs to the reservoir's torn floating cover. The facility's offline status during the fire raised questions, as firefighters in the area reported encountering hydrants with low water pressure. While officials are pleased the critical infrastructure is operational again, a local councilmember noted it was unavailable "on the one day in history it was needed most," highlighting the need for better emergency readiness.</p>
