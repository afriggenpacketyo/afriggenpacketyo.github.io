          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 02:12:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a cut to its 2025 sales growth guidance due to increased competition from drug copycats affecting Wegovy sales, although the company still reported a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit. The Danish pharmaceutical giant's net profit reached 29.03 billion Danish kroner, surpassing analyst forecasts, but Wegovy sales fell slightly short of expectations at 17.36 billion Danish kroner. Consequently, the company adjusted its sales growth forecast for 2025 to 13-21%, down from the previously projected 16-24%. The pharmaceutical company still produces diabetes and rare disease treatments.</p>

The CSRC also plans to introduce yuan-denominated stock counters to the southbound Stock Connect mechanism and support the launch of cross-border investment products in Hong Kong.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed concern over the potential loss of China's artificial intelligence (AI) market due to tightening export restrictions from the U.S., emphasizing that the market is projected to reach US$50 billion in the next few years. Huang stated that it would be a significant loss for American companies to be unable to participate in this market, as sales to China would contribute to U.S. revenue, taxes, and job creation. Nvidia has been navigating the impact of U.S. export controls, which have been expanded to include its China-tailored H20 AI chips, and seeks to maintain its presence in the country, which accounted for approximately 14% of its revenue last financial year.</p>

One sex worker's information led to the arrest of a man abusing his daughter, while another reported child abuse photos, leading to the offender's trial.

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist, argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis of the U.S.'s economic challenges. Rogoff suggests that while the dollar's reserve-currency status contributes to trade deficits, it is just one of many factors, and tariffs are not a cure-all. He proposes that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix, although it would require politically challenging congressional action. Rogoff also points out that the strength of the American economy is a key factor behind the current account deficit, making U.S. businesses attractive to investors.</p>

          <p>As Russia prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War II, the national narrative is increasingly linking the historical event to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The anniversary receives considerable attention, emphasizing Russia as both victor and victim. Events such as historical re-enactments and monuments are used to connect past and present conflicts, with state media portraying the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War II against Nazism and fascism. Despite the historical victory, Russia faces challenges in Ukraine, with the Kremlin's "special military operation" continuing without a clear end in sight.</p>

          <p>Alicia Vikander, an Oscar-winning actress, is set to make her UK theatre debut in a new production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, marking her first stage role in 17 years. The production, adapted and directed by Simon Stone, will run at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks, starting September 10. Vikander will play the lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper, who is forced to choose between her current and former lover. She said she was "thrilled" to be returning to theatre, but added it was a "daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult".</p>

          <p>India fired missiles into Pakistan, killing at least 19 people and injuring 38 others, according to the Pakistani Army. The strikes targeted what India claimed was infrastructure used by militants, amidst rising tensions over a militant attack in Kashmir. Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed attacks on five locations, labeling them an act of cowardice and asserting Pakistan's right to respond. The Pakistani army spokesperson stated that the missiles were launched from within Indian territory and that no Indian aircraft had entered Pakistani airspace. President Trump called the strikes "a shame" and hoped for a quick resolution.</p>

Chinese investment in Morocco's energy, electric vehicle, and battery sectors has surged. However, rising tensions between the U.S. and China pose a balancing act for Morocco, where economic and geopolitical interests do not always align. The Trump administration could pressure Morocco to take a stance against China, potentially threatening higher tariffs. Morocco also values its strategic partnership with the U.S. and its security relationship with NATO.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's economy has shown impressive resilience despite the war, underpinned by effective military resistance and state capacity. The state has increased the size of its armed forces and invested in defense production. However, Ukraine lacks the resources to meet the war's costs domestically and depends on external financial support. Russia's economy, often portrayed as successful, is fundamentally dependent on fossil fuels. The minerals agreement with the United States complicates that assessment, offering a stark reminder of the country’s basic dependency on its allies.</p>
