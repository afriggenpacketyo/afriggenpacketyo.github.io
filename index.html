        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing expectations and signaling continued weakness in consumption, despite government stimulus measures aimed at boosting domestic demand. Industrial output, however, grew by 6.1%, exceeding forecasts, indicating resilience against U.S. tariffs due to export diversification. The real estate sector continues to struggle, with home prices declining, while the urban unemployment rate eased slightly to 5.1%. Despite some positive signs in industrial output, the National Bureau of Statistics cautioned about unstable external factors and the need to further consolidate economic recovery.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's downgrade of the United States' credit rating has intensified worries about the economic impact of President Trump's policies and the nation's rising debt levels. The downgrade, triggered by concerns over fiscal deficits and the potential cost of making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, has rattled financial markets. U.S. stock futures indicated a market decline, and Treasury bond yields rose as investors grew wary of the safe-haven status of U.S. debt. Analysts suggest the downgrade could prompt increased scrutiny of fiscal spending and interest rates in other countries as well, potentially leading to broader market volatility.

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The diagnosis was made after Biden experienced urinary symptoms and sought medical evaluation, revealing a high-grade cancer with a Gleason score of 9. Treatment options for Biden are limited due to the cancer's aggressive nature and metastasis, but hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and clinical trials are being considered to manage the disease. While not curative, these treatments aim to stabilize the patient and control the cancer's growth, with his family reviewing all available options.</p>

          <p>Apple is significantly increasing its iPhone production in India, aiming for a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. to originate there, as part of a strategy to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.

India needs to invest heavily in infrastructure and skills to become a truly independent manufacturing hub for Apple, but geopolitical tensions could hinder the transfer of technology and expertise from China.</p>

          <p>An ongoing corruption investigation involving staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) serves as a reminder of the importance of oversight in defense spending, particularly as NATO countries increase their military budgets. The probe, involving detentions in Belgium and the Netherlands, focuses on potential irregularities in contracts for arms and ammunition, with indications that employees may have passed information to defense contractors. As NATO countries increase defense spending, experts warn of the heightened risk of corruption due to secrecy, large sums of money, and the sensitive nature of negotiations, urging increased transparency and oversight mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee revived President Trump's stalled bill to cut taxes and spending after negotiations with fiscally conservative Republicans, who initially blocked the bill due to concerns about insufficient debt reduction. While the conservatives switched their votes to "present," allowing the bill to advance, they secured commitments for changes, including speeding up Medicaid work requirements and curtailing clean energy tax credits. The bill, which would make President Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, still faces major hurdles, including opposition from Democrats and moderate Republicans.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the Northwest are struggling with low wheat prices and the ongoing trade war, creating uncertainty and economic hardship in rural communities. The rising costs of equipment and inputs, combined with disrupted trade agreements, are pushing many farmers to the brink of financial ruin. While there is still broad support for Trump in farm country, farmers are concerned about the impact of his trade policies on their livelihoods and the potential for a looming depression.</p>

          <p>Russia's occupation of eastern Ukraine mirrors the Soviet occupation of eastern Europe, marked by forced citizenship, property confiscation, and suppression of national identity. The author argues that understanding the Soviet occupation as a crime is essential for European security, as Russia, like the USSR, uses violence and oppression to enforce its will. With the invasion of Ukraine, Russia is eroding the political landscape, upsetting alliances, and dragging the world into moral relativism, requiring a coordinated effort to counter Russian imperialism and build a future based on mutual knowledge and compassion.</p>

Critics, including leading Democrats and some of Trump's allies, have called the gift corrupt and a stain on the administration. Trump defended the gift, claiming it was for the US and not for him personally, but critics dispute this assertion.</p>

          <p>British mountaineer Kenton Cool has set a new record by reaching the summit of Mount Everest for the 19th time, breaking his own record for a non-sherpa. The 51-year-old accomplished this feat accompanied by Nepali sherpa Dorji Gyaljen, amidst reports of at least two climber deaths on the mountain this week. Cool, a mountain guide who has led notable figures like Sir Ranulph Fiennes, first climbed Everest in 2004 and has summited it almost yearly since.</p>

          <p>Portugal's governing right-of-center Democratic Alliance has won snap parliamentary elections, but has once again fallen short of a majority. Its leader, LuÃ­s Montenegro, promised supporters to stimulate investment and guarantee prosperity and social justice. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation after his party finished in second, and lost so many seats it ended up neck-and-neck with far-right Chega.</p>
