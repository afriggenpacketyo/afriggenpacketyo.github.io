            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, can proceed despite opposition from the new District Attorney.

            <p>South Carolina executed Mikal Mahdi by firing squad for the murder of a police officer, marking the second execution by this method in the state in recent weeks. Mahdi chose the firing squad over lethal injection or the electric chair. South Carolina has resumed executions after a 13-year pause due to difficulties in obtaining lethal injection drugs. Mahdi admitted to killing two people, including the officer, and had a history of violence in prison. Optimism score: 0</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing him back, but suggested the lower court may have exceeded its authority. Abrego Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error," though the government alleges he is a member of MS-13, which his lawyer denies. The judge ordered the Trump administration to provide daily updates on efforts to bring Mr. Garcia back to the US. Optimism score: 45</p>
