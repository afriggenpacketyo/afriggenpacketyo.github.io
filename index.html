        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming service Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The company aims to focus on high-quality programming and storytelling, emphasizing quality over quantity. CEO David Zaslav stated that bringing back the HBO brand, known for its prestige, will accelerate growth. The streaming business has improved its profitability and added millions of subscribers, though it lost rights to NBA games and prioritizes debt reduction. JB Perrette, president and CEO of streaming, highlighted the platform's focus on distinct and great content for adults and families, mirroring competitor Disney's strategy of prioritizing quality. The rebrand is part of a larger trend of legacy media companies struggling to achieve profitability in streaming. </p>

          <p>The United States President Donald Trump announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria, a significant policy shift after 14 years of civil war. The sanctions had crippled the Syrian economy, exacerbating humanitarian crises. Trump stated the decision followed talks with Saudi and Turkish leaders, expressing hope for Syria's future stability under its new interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. The move has been welcomed by US lawmakers and the UN, with expectations of massive investment to rebuild the war-torn nation. Lifting sanctions will facilitate aid delivery and encourage investment from wealthy neighbors, though challenges remain, including corruption and devastated infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Three far-right extremists in the UK have been convicted of terrorism offenses after amassing a large cache of weapons and planning attacks on targets such as mosques and synagogues. The men, who communicated online, were found to possess over 200 weapons, including machetes, swords, and a 3D-printed firearm. The group's leader detailed plans to torture victims, including local imams, using an "information extraction kit." An undercover officer infiltrated the group, which had never met in person, revealing their preparations for what they believed was an inevitable race war. </p>

Kennedy emphasized his focus on addressing chronic diseases and improving Medicare and Medicaid services while cutting costs.

Kennedy also faced scrutiny regarding his past controversial comments on vaccines and the agency's response to a recent measles outbreak. He maintained his support for vaccines, while also stating the CDC will study whether vaccines cause autism, which drew criticism from committee members. </p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the extraction of valuable metals from wastewater, particularly from the Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana, to increase U.S. production of rare earths. The Berkeley Pit contains 50 billion gallons of acidic, toxic liquid, from which Montana Resources extracts copper. Researchers are now focusing on extracting neodymium and praseodymium, vital for electric vehicles and defense purposes. This method is considered more economical and cleaner than starting new mines. The project is awaiting a Department of Defense grant to build a concentrator, and if successful, could provide a significant portion of the U.S.'s rare-earth element needs. </p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are one step closer to potential freedom after being resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The brothers argued they acted in self-defense, claiming they suffered years of sexual abuse by their father. The resentencing follows a recommendation from the former Los Angeles County District Attorney, citing the "complexities surrounding sexual violence" and the brothers' rehabilitation efforts. The brothers' fate now rests with state parole officials and the California Governor. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration faces criticism for prioritizing the resettlement of white South African refugees while simultaneously restricting refugees from other countries. The State Department welcomed 59 Afrikaners, fast-tracking their applications under an executive order citing "unjust racial discrimination." The administration has dodged questions about funding for the refugees' travel. Critics argue that the move represents a double standard, as the administration has moved to rescind temporary protected status for Afghans and other groups. </p>

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to a temporary truce in their trade war, marked by a reduction in import duties.

The People's Bank of China renewed a bilateral currency swap agreement with Brazil, aimed at boosting local currency use and trade.

While some universities are developing AI guidelines, there is no consensus on what constitutes acceptable use. Professors argue that AI saves time, helps with workloads, and serves as an automated teaching assistant, but students question the hypocrisy of being prohibited from using the same tools. </p>
