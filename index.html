According to the Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills, the blast caused significant damage to nearby buildings. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, stated that all staff were safe and that eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials remained secure. The FBI and ATF are assisting in the investigation, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating that violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable. </p>

          <p>The UK and EU are set to hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit, driven by shared concerns over Russia, China, and global security. The agenda includes a joint declaration on foreign policy priorities, a security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. While Prime Minister Starmer aims to reset relations, he remains cautious due to Eurosceptic sentiments and fears of betraying Brexit. The summit will address issues such as plant and animal health agreements, fishing rights, youth mobility, and cooperation on illegal migration and energy trading. The discussions also involve the UK's access to EU defense contracts, complicated by France's protectionist stance. </p>

          <p>The FDA approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but only for older adults and high-risk individuals over 12, requiring the company to conduct further studies on potential heart conditions. This decision has drawn criticism, with some experts arguing it unnecessarily restricts access for healthy individuals under 65. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s influence on health agencies is cited as a possible factor, as the new restrictions deviate from the usual process of COVID-19 vaccine approvals. The approval requires Novavax to complete costly studies, raising concerns about the vaccine's availability. </p>

          <p>Federal courts are resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court rebuked the administration for providing insufficient warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. The administration's efforts to bypass due process, including considering suspending habeas corpus, have faced legal challenges. Courts have emphasized that immigrants must have the opportunity to contest their deportations, even under the Alien Enemies Act. </p>
