          <p>Security raids on the homes of Chinese-American cybersecurity researcher Wang Xiaofeng have revived concerns about racial profiling within the US scientific community, reminiscent of the Trump administration's "China Initiative."  The FBI and DHS conducted the searches under warrant but haven't disclosed the reasons, causing unease among Chinese-American scientists.
