          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, citing a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, old technology, and depleted federal funds as key issues. The airport has experienced numerous delays and cancellations, impacting travelers and raising concerns about its ability to handle summer flight volumes. United Airlines is cutting flights, and the FAA has instituted flow constraints. Travelers have expressed frustration with the lack of quick solutions, with some finding themselves stranded due to the ongoing issues.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the constitutional and Supreme Court precedents regarding due process for non-citizens on U.S. soil reveals that while all individuals are entitled to due process, the specifics vary. The government must provide notice and an opportunity to be heard, but not necessarily a trial, for every migrant detained and ordered deported. The type of notice and hearing depends on factors like legal admission, community ties, or asylum claims. The Trump administration's practices, such as expedited removal, are being challenged, raising questions about the fairness and reasonableness of the processes used in deportations.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House have advanced a bill introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to permanently rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, despite opposition from Democrats. Democrats have criticized the bill as a politically motivated attempt to appease former President Donald Trump, who initially signed an executive order to change the name. Republicans, however, argue it is a historic move that symbolizes America First and the country's energy independence. The bill is expected to be voted on by the full House this Thursday.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, an abortion pill, echoing the Biden administration's stance in the case. The lawsuit challenges regulatory changes made by the FDA that expanded access to the medication, including telemedicine prescriptions. The administration argues that the case does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. This action aligns with the Biden administration's previous position, despite President Trump's opposition to abortion rights.</p>

The virus has infected over 1,000 dairy herds across 17 states, and raw milk samples have tested positive for bird flu. Health officials say there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission, but experts fear the virus could mutate or adapt to become more severe. The U.S. is investing $1 billion to fight bird flu, including funding for biosecurity measures, financial relief for farmers, and vaccine research.</p>

Farmers are concerned about potential losses and are tightening their belts, delaying equipment purchases and seeking government assistance. Many believe President Trump will provide a safety net, but the uncertainty surrounding tariffs and the farm economy is causing anxiety.</p>
