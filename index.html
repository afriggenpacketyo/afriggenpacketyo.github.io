          <p>Indian officials reported that Pakistan has been moving troops into forward areas, suggesting an offensive intent, after India claimed Pakistan attacked 26 locations across India. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that Pakistani actions have consistently provoked and escalated the situation, while Indian Army Col. Sofiya Qureshi affirmed India's readiness but commitment to non-escalation if Pakistan reciprocates. Wing Commander Vyomika Singh refuted Pakistani claims of damaging Indian military infrastructure, dismissing them as misinformation. The escalating tensions follow an attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India attributes to Pakistani-backed militants, leading to retaliatory strikes by both sides.</p>

          <p>Amidst ongoing missile strikes, Pakistan's foreign minister indicated a willingness to consider de-escalation if India ceases its attacks, echoing India's sentiment for non-escalation contingent on Pakistan's reciprocity.

Indian officials reported targeting Pakistani air bases in response to missile firings at Indian infrastructure, while also noting troop movements suggesting further escalation.

          <p>Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, stated that the Trump administration is considering suspending immigrants' right to challenge their detention in court, citing the Constitution's allowance for such action during an invasion. This proposal has faced legal challenges, with experts questioning its constitutionality and raising concerns about executive overreach. Miller argued that because immigration courts fall under the executive branch, the president's decisions cannot be overruled by the courts. The administration has repeatedly likened its immigration crackdown to a war, despite legal rulings rejecting this characterization.</p>

Google claims the changes align with its policy of following official U.S. government geographic designations.

          <p>As China and the United States engage in formal trade talks, analysts predict a wide range of outcomes, from a pause in import duties to a complete breakdown in negotiations. Jayant Menon suggests a best-case scenario where China receives a similar suspension of import duties as other nations, while worst-case scenarios involve one or both parties walking out without consensus. Since Trump's return to the White House, tariffs on Chinese imports have significantly increased, prompting retaliatory duties from China. The outcome of these talks will greatly impact trade, jobs, and consumption in both countries.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supplies and manufacturing, aiming to counter foreign pressures and assert China's economic power. This involves increasing exports, directing central bank lending to industrial borrowers, and introducing economic warfare tactics like export controls and blacklists. China's dominance in critical minerals and technologies allows it to retaliate against tariffs and exert influence over other nations. While this strategy strengthens China's global position, it also carries costs, including strained relationships with trading partners and potential job losses within China.</p>
