          <p>The Trump administration has lifted its stop-work order on Equinor's Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm project in New York, allowing construction to resume. This decision follows apparent compromises related to gas pipeline projects within the state. Empire Wind 1 will be the first offshore wind project to deliver electricity directly to New York City and is expected to support 1,500 union jobs. Equinor aims to proceed with installation activities this year to achieve commercial operations by 2027, minimizing the impact of the prior work stoppage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As seniors face financial pressures, experts are weighing the pros and cons of using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) versus a reverse mortgage. HELOCs offer flexible financing at lower interest rates, beneficial for short-term needs like home improvements or debt repayment. Reverse mortgages, typically available to seniors 62 and up, allow homeowners to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income. However, reverse mortgages accrue interest and fees, reducing home equity over time, making HELOCs preferable for those who can afford the monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Fed reports a spike in student loan delinquencies following the Trump administration's resumption of collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans. This has led to concerns about potential 'spillover effects,' where borrowers may struggle to meet other debt obligations, such as credit card bills and auto loans. The resumption of collections could reduce disposable personal income, impacting consumers' ability to manage various financial responsibilities. Experts suggest that some individuals may be adding to credit card debt due to the pressure of repaying student loans, indicating a broader financial strain.</p>

The Kremlin maintains commitment to a broader reset, but analysts suggest Putin believes time is on his side, with stabilized oil prices and a growing Russian economy potentially reducing incentives to compromise until the end of a summer offensive.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued a rare public reprimand of Israel, condemning its renewed military offensive in Gaza and its restrictions on humanitarian aid as "disproportionate" and "egregious." The three allies threatened further concrete actions if Israel does not cease the offensive and lift aid restrictions. Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel responded by accusing the countries of handing a “huge prize” to Hamas and tacitly encouraging further attacks. The criticism reflects mounting international frustration with Israel's actions and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

The bill, officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been approved by the budget committee but faces further hurdles in the House and Senate.</p>
