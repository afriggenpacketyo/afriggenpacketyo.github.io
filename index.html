          <h2>SALT Deduction Limits Cause Republican Infighting Over Trump's Tax Bill</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" faces challenges due to disagreements over the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes, benefiting residents of high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. Republicans are divided, with those representing high-tax districts pushing for an increase in the SALT cap, while fiscal conservatives oppose it due to concerns about subsidizing blue states and increasing the national debt. Trump has urged Republicans to not let SALT impede the bill, but a tentative deal to raise the cap to $30,000 has faced strong opposition from fiscal hardliners, leading to uncertainty about the bill's passage. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by Qatar, intending to use it as the new Air Force One, despite warnings of bribery accusations. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accepted the plane, valued at $400 million, with the Department of Defense working to ensure proper security measures. Experts estimate converting the jet into Air Force One could cost over $1 billion and take years, raising concerns among Democrats and some Republicans about national security risks and ethical issues. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to hold up Trump's political nominees until there is transparency regarding the deal. </p>

          <p>Two individuals, Cortnie Harris and Corvanntay Baptiste, have been arrested for allegedly assisting some of the ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail.

Baptiste allegedly provided food to escaped inmate Corey Boyd while he was in hiding, before Boyd was captured. These arrests follow the apprehension of Sterling Williams, a maintenance worker at the jail, who claimed he was threatened by one of the inmates involved in the escape. </p>

          <p>State Farm is pursuing an additional 11% rate increase for homeowners policies in California, following a recent 17% emergency interim hike. The company claims the increases are necessary due to "severe capital depletion," particularly after wildfires in Los Angeles County. Consumer Watchdog has urged the insurance commissioner to reject the rate increase, arguing that State Farm has not justified the need for a mid-proceeding rate hike. The California Department of Insurance plans to hold a hearing to examine the facts, emphasizing that all rates must be justified to protect consumers. </p>

          <p>Freedom Debt Relief offers debt settlement services, negotiating with creditors to reduce debt in exchange for lump-sum payments. The process involves a free consultation, a dedicated FDIC-insured account for accumulating funds, and negotiation with creditors. Fees range from 15% to 25% of the total enrolled debt, paid as debts are settled, and the program typically lasts 24 to 48 months. While it can reduce debt, it may severely damage credit scores and creditors may sue. The company has positive reviews and an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, but it should be viewed as a serious intervention, not a quick fix. </p>

          <p>For beginners interested in investing in gold bars and coins, there are new and easier ways to invest, such as online gold investment companies and even big box retailers like Walmart and Costco. Fractional gold offers an accessible entry point, allowing investors to start with smaller amounts. While gold prices are currently high, they are likely to rise again due to factors like inflation and geopolitical tensions, making it prudent to invest sooner rather than later. Gold should be a small portion of a diversified portfolio (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department is dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville and Minneapolis, ending investigations launched during the Biden administration. The administration claims the consent decrees sought by the Biden administration would have led to "years of micromanagement" of local departments. The Justice Department is also closing investigations into police departments in Phoenix, Trenton, Memphis, Mount Vernon, Oklahoma City, and the Louisiana State Police. The decision comes nearly five years after George Floyd's death, which prompted the investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department. </p>

          <p>President Trump's missile defense project, the "Golden Dome for America," aims to protect the U.S. from foreign missile threats through a multilayered system deploying technologies across land, sea, and space. The plan, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, includes space-based sensors and interceptors. China has criticized the project, stating it would increase the risks of militarizing space and fuel an arms race. The initiative draws inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome system, and Lockheed Martin describes it as a "revolutionary concept". </p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced a U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments, following political pressure after millions of pensioners lost out on the payments due to means-testing. The government will change the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again, though the specifics are unclear. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown supported the move, emphasizing that no pensioner should be forced into poverty.

HELOC interest rates have been on a steady decline since early 2024, and they can function as a useful emergency fund. Unlike a home equity loan, a HELOC will only require borrowers to pay the interest on the amount of money borrowed during the draw period. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The article discusses the election of Pope Leo XIV, an American by birth who served in Peru for many years, as the new leader of the Catholic Church. The author contrasts the Pope's message of compassion and love with the divisive rhetoric often seen in American politics. The Pope's focus on serving the poor and promoting shared humanity is presented as an alternative to the often-confrontational style of leadership in the United States. The author suggests that the new Pope offers an example of Americans being strong and compassionate, even amidst disagreement. </p>
