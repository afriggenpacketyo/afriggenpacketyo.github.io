        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House clarified that it will be an additional proclamation, not a replacement. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that Veterans Day will not be renamed but supplemented with another proclamation. Trump also intends to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing federal holidays requires congressional approval, and this action sparked confusion and backtracking within the administration. This article provides live updates on the Trump administration's policies and announcements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge permanently struck down an executive order by Donald Trump that targeted the law firm Perkins Coie, which had worked with Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. Judge Beryl Howell deemed the order unconstitutional, violating the first, fifth, and sixth amendments. The executive order restricted Perkins Coie's access to federal buildings and government employees, which Howell called retaliatory and discriminatory. The judge criticized the order's broad reach, requiring companies with government contracts to disclose any work with Perkins Coie, regardless of relevance. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>This article explores the rising rates of autism diagnoses, examining whether the increase reflects a genuine rise in autistic individuals or changes in diagnostic criteria. It notes that autism diagnoses have increased significantly, particularly among women and adults, but a rise in diagnoses does not necessarily indicate a rise in the number of autistic people. Factors contributing to the increase include broadened diagnostic criteria, better recognition of autism in women, and greater awareness leading to more diagnoses in adults with milder forms of autism. The article also touches on the tensions within the autistic community regarding the diversity of experiences and perceptions of autism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced plans to reorganize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and significantly reduce staffing to levels similar to those during Ronald Reagan's presidency. This could mean thousands fewer employees, particularly in the Office of Research and Development (ORD), which provides scientific analysis on environmental risks. The EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, said the changes are intended to improve efficiency and save money. Experts worry that the cuts could undermine crucial research on air pollution, chemicals, and other environmental hazards, potentially endangering public health and safety. Zeldin intends to cut EPA's budget by 65% in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree in northern England has revealed key evidence, including video footage of the felling, a piece of wood identified as coming from the tree found in one of the defendant's cars, and cell site analysis tracking their movements. Daniel Graham testified that his friend, Adam Carruthers, felled the tree without his knowledge, while Carruthers denies the charges. The felling of the iconic tree sparked international outrage, and the trial continues to determine the defendants' guilt or innocence in the act of criminal damage to the tree and Roman wall.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Kings suffered another first-round playoff loss to the Edmonton Oilers, continuing a painful trend despite a promising season. The Kings tied franchise records for wins and points but failed to advance in the playoffs for the 11th consecutive season. A turning point in the series was a controversial call in Game 3 that led to an Oilers' victory, followed by a Kings' collapse in Game 4. The Oilers have now won nine of the 11 playoff series against the Kings, highlighting Edmonton's dominance over Los Angeles in the postseason.</p>

          <p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has laid off most of its remaining staff, severely impacting worker safety programs. The layoffs, ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, responsible for vetting safety equipment like N95 masks, has also ceased operations.

          <p>Seven months before the Pacific Palisades fire, Los Angeles water managers were trying to revive an old reservoir to boost the area's limited water capacity, as the main reservoir was offline for repairs. Emails show the city searched for solutions but failed to correct the problem in time. The plan to bring the old reservoir back online was never completed due to structural and safety issues. Firefighters ran short of water in fighting the blaze, and the inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the potential water supply in the area.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Office has defended its decision to classify the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, following criticism from US officials. The AfD, which came second in federal elections, is accused of aiming to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society. The classification gives authorities greater powers to monitor the AfD. The German Foreign Office referenced the country's history with the Nazi party, emphasizing the need to stop right-wing extremism.</p>

          <p>Conservatives in Canada are assessing their recent election loss, which saw them squander a significant lead in opinion polls. The party gained seats but failed to win the election for the fourth time in a row, and leader Pierre Poilievre lost his own seat. Poilievre plans to run in a special election in Alberta to regain a seat, with a fellow MP stepping down to allow him to run. The party is debating its strategy moving forward, with some blaming Ontario leader Doug Ford for the loss.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will cancel 35 roundtrip flights daily from Newark Liberty International Airport due to air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. CEO Scott Kirby blamed the disruptions on these issues, stating that the airport cannot handle its scheduled flights. The FAA acknowledged staffing issues were delaying operations. United is urging the agency to establish flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cited outdated technology as a cause and called for an all-new air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst global economic uncertainty, testing the popularity of the long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP). While the PAP is expected to retain power, discontent over rising costs of living and housing affordability is fueling the opposition.

The opposition has criticized the PAP for its short campaigning period and gerrymandering, while the PAP defends its track record of stability and prosperity.
