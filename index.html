          <p>Former President Donald Trump has denied a Wall Street Journal report that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convinced him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The article claimed Bessent warned that such a move could destabilize financial markets and argued it was unnecessary as the Fed was already expected to cut interest rates. In a social media post, Trump called the story untruthful, asserting that he understands the market better than anyone and does not need others to explain it to him. This public dispute highlights the ongoing tension between Trump and the central bank's leadership.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused significant flash flooding in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, with several roads becoming impassable. An amber weather warning, the second-highest alert level, has been issued for eastern parts of Northern Ireland, anticipating further downpours and potential danger to life from fast-flowing floodwaters. Eyewitnesses described the deluge as sudden and severe, with the force of the water lifting manhole covers from the ground. Authorities have warned of difficult driving conditions and likely power outages as the severe weather is expected to continue.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is being used to house asylum seekers, escalated into disorder with demonstrators throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of alleged sexual assaults, which has inflamed local tensions. Police, who had anticipated trouble and put a special order in place, made one arrest during the confrontation. This event follows a previous protest where eight officers were injured, indicating a significant and volatile escalation in the community.</p>
