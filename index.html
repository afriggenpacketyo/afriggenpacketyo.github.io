          <p>A small panga-style fishing boat capsized in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Del Mar near San Diego, resulting in three fatalities and nine individuals missing. The US Coast Guard initiated a search and rescue operation after the incident occurred near Torrey Pines State Beach. Authorities reported that at least 16 people were aboard the vessel, including two children, and four individuals were transported to a local hospital for treatment. The exact cause of the capsizing is still under investigation as rescue efforts continue to locate the missing passengers.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is leading a coalition of 20 states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging cuts to public health funding and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions, including mass firings and program closures, violate numerous laws and undermine public health infrastructure. James argues that these cuts endanger lives by weakening the government's ability to respond to infectious diseases and provide essential health services, accusing the administration of sabotaging the federal government and depriving HHS of necessary resources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump falsely asserted that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. This claim contradicts actual prices, which average over $3 per gallon nationwide. Trump's figure appears to be based on the price of RBOB gasoline futures, a wholesale contract that excludes taxes, transportation costs, and retail expenses. Analysts emphasize that RBOB prices are irrelevant to consumers, as they do not reflect the final price at the pump, highlighting the discrepancy between Trump's statement and the reality faced by U.S. drivers.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices declined by approximately 2% following OPEC+'s decision to increase production for the second consecutive month. The group, led by Saudi Arabia, will raise output by 411,000 barrels per day in June, adding to May's production surge. This decision, exceeding analysts' forecasts, raised concerns about oversupply amid fears of a recession triggered by President Trump's tariffs, which could reduce demand. Consequently, Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for U.S. crude prices, anticipating continued weakness in the oil market.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing its overpayment clawback rate from 100% to 50% after a recent policy change sparked concerns about financial hardship for beneficiaries. The SSA's decision to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to recover overpayments, directed by Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, faced criticism for its potential impact on low-income individuals. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to SSA's own calculation errors, leading to calls for a more lenient approach to recouping funds from recipients.</p>
