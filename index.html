          <p>Shenzhen, China's technology and export hub, is launching a 39-point plan to stimulate domestic consumption and aid exporters amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The plan emphasizes leveraging Shenzhen's strengths in AI terminals, smart home systems, fashion, and outdoor equipment, utilizing trade exhibitions to help businesses navigate tariffs. This initiative aims to strengthen China's consumption market, recognizing its importance as a key driver of economic growth amid external pressures from the US-China trade war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the United States to provide concrete signals regarding air defense systems, emphasizing the need to strengthen Ukraine's capabilities against Russian attacks.

          <p>The UK government is set to allocate an Â£86 billion package to the science and technology sector, aimed at funding research in areas such as drug treatments and battery technology. The package includes up to Â£500 million for regions across the UK, with local leaders deciding how the funds are spent to target expertise specific to their areas. Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized that investing in the sector would create jobs and enhance security, although research backers have cautioned that more needs to be done to secure the UK's reputation in science globally. Areas like Liverpool will use the money to speed up drug discovery, Northern Ireland will develop defense equipment, and South Wales will design microchips, but concerns remain about visa costs for scientists and financial challenges at universities.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers in China and the United States found that PLA microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice, potentially contributing to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. This is the first time microplastics have been found to enter the body's metabolic cycle, raising concerns about the widespread use of PLA in food packaging and disposable tableware. The study highlights the need for further research on the potential health impacts of biodegradable plastics.</p>

However, the government faces challenges in balancing budgetary pressures, managing public finances, and addressing long-term issues such as industrial energy prices and worker illness, all while navigating a complex political landscape. The review will also assess spending from first principles, with the aim of rewiring the state and getting Britain moving, potentially leading to axed projects and investments in AI scanners in healthcare.</p>
