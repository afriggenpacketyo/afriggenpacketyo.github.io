          <p>A 32-year-old woman in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, has pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct after allowing a young girl to drive a car. The incident, which occurred in poor weather with the child driving barefoot, was captured in a video that circulated on social media. The footage shows the child peering over the steering wheel while the woman cheers her on. A judge has deferred sentencing pending a criminal justice social work report on the woman.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) is flawed and needs reform. The product, designed for first-home purchases or retirement, carries a significant penalty for early withdrawals, which can result in savers getting back less than they invested. MPs on the Treasury Committee highlighted that the product's dual purpose can lead to unsuitable investment strategies and noted a surge in costly unauthorized withdrawals.

          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax on U.S. technology firms, paving the way for the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack." The 3% levy would have retroactively hit major tech companies like Google and Amazon. This retreat is seen by some analysts as a victory for the White House and a way to advance negotiations on broader economic and security issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive and controversial spending package championed by President Trump has cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate with a narrow 51-49 vote.

The legislation now faces a final vote in the Senate before it must be passed again by the House, where it also faces opposition from some Republicans.</p>

          <p>The field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is advancing rapidly, with several companies like Neuralink and Precision Neuroscience developing implantable devices to help people with paralysis. These technologies work by decoding brain signals to control computers, move prosthetic limbs, or generate speech. While still in experimental stages, recent successes have shown that individuals can control cursors and communicate using only their thoughts, offering the potential for significantly enhanced quality of life.</p>

          <p>With the conclusion of the Glastonbury Festival, a massive cleanup operation is now underway at the Worthy Farm site in Somerset. Thousands of volunteers have begun the task of clearing the fields of discarded items left by festival-goers. Attendees were encouraged to leave early to avoid traffic and high temperatures, and to take all their belongings with them. The cleanup is particularly important as the festival will have a fallow year in 2026 to allow the land to recover.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive outdoor smoking ban that prohibits lighting up in public parks, at beaches, and near schools.

Violators of the ban face fines, although the current rules do not extend to e-cigarettes, a point of criticism for some who believe it weakens the measure's impact on youth.</p>
