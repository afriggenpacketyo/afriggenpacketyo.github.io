          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to significantly reduce sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways, aiming for a 50% reduction by 2030. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the water sector as "broken" and promised tougher regulations, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company executives. The plan, which rules out nationalizing the industry due to high costs, comes ahead of a major review and amid public anger over pollution incidents and executive bonuses.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first joint army training exercise, focusing on border patrol, in China's Guangxi region. This military cooperation marks a significant step in their relationship, which has been strengthening economically and diplomatically, particularly in the context of the ongoing US-China trade war. The move occurs during the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations and follows Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for the nations to unite against "unilateral bullying."</p>

          <p>A sudden storm in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay caused a tourist boat named Wonder Seas, carrying 53 people, to capsize, resulting in at least 35 deaths with several people still missing. Most of the passengers were Vietnamese families, and the victims included at least eight children. Rescue efforts were hampered by heavy rain, and authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the tragic incident in the popular UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups who successfully fought against an initial order to euthanize the bear. This case has highlighted the growing conflict between humans and the expanding bear population in Italy's Trentino region, which was part of an EU-funded reintroduction project.</p>

          <p>A study conducted at a Danish hospital using sensors on toilets and sinks found that 43.7% of users did not wash their hands after flushing. Researchers from the University of Surrey, who partnered on the study, expressed concern that this poor hygiene behavior could directly impact patient safety by spreading illness. The findings suggest that despite heightened awareness from the pandemic, handwashing is not second nature, prompting calls for more effective behavioral strategies to improve compliance.</p>

          <p>In a notable Wisconsin murder case, data from a Fitbit device played a crucial role in exonerating a man initially suspected of killing his girlfriend. After Nicole Vander Heyden was found murdered in 2016, her boyfriend Doug Detrie was arrested, but his Fitbit data showed minimal activity during the time of the murder, corroborating his alibi. Investigators then used Google Dashboard data from another man's phone, George Steven Burch, to place him at the crime scene, leading to his eventual conviction.</p>
