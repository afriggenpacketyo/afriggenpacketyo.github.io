          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," examines the historical optimism in U.S.-China relations through the profiles of 12 influential Chinese individuals who engaged with the United States. The book's editors argue that this optimism has faded due to China's rise as a major power, leading to a climate of fear and distrust that overshadows the past benefits of cooperation. These stories serve as a reminder of a unique chapter in bilateral relations, highlighting how engagement fostered mutual understanding and contributed to China's modernization, a perspective now challenged by current geopolitical competition.</p>

          <p>Nikos Michaloliakos, the leader of the now-defunct Greek neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn, has been granted early release from prison on health grounds, less than halfway through his 13-year sentence. He was convicted in 2020 for running a criminal organization responsible for violent attacks against immigrants and political opponents, including the murder of an anti-fascist musician. The decision has sparked outrage from left-wing parties in Greece, who argue it sends a message of impunity for fascism and undermines the justice system's credibility.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel drew scrutiny for incorrectly announcing that a suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was in custody, only to retract the statement less than two hours later. While the FBI successfully apprehended the actual suspect the following day, the initial misstep fueled criticism about Patel's fitness for the job and his focus on social media. This incident occurred amid an intense 33-hour manhunt and highlighted confusion as law enforcement officials were simultaneously reporting that the gunman remained at large.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the U.S., has been dismissed from his post after newly revealed emails showed his deep and continued support for Jeffrey Epstein following the financier's 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor. The emails, in which Mandelson called Epstein his "best pal" and expressed fury over his conviction, were deemed "new information" by the Foreign Office. The scandal has created a political crisis for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had initially defended Mandelson's appointment just a day before the emails were published.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues President Biden's Reelection Bid Hindered the Democratic Party's Next Generation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that President Biden's 2024 reelection campaign effectively sidelined a new generation of Democratic leaders, including Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom, by breaking an implicit 2020 promise to be a one-term "bridge" president. The author contends that this decision drained energy from the party and left Harris with only 107 days to mount a full presidential campaign after Biden eventually withdrew. The piece suggests that criticism of Harris's subsequent loss is misplaced, arguing the difficult timeline created by Biden's prolonged candidacy was a primary factor in the election's outcome.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica has declared itself in fiscal distress, facing a severe financial crisis driven by hundreds of millions of dollars in legal settlements related to a former police dispatcher's sexual abuse scandal. This issue is compounded by a post-pandemic economic downturn, including declining tourism and retail revenue. The city has already paid out $229 million and faces 180 additional claims, straining its budget and raising concerns among city employees about potential layoffs. Officials are now seeking strategies to realign city operations and secure financial relief.</p>

          <p>In an effort to simultaneously address China's declining birth rate and bolster its scientific workforce, Shanghai has launched a pilot subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after childbirth. The program, initially covering the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to 20 new mothers. This initiative targets two of the country's major policy priorities by providing targeted support to retain valuable talent in the science and technology sectors while encouraging childbirth.</p>

          <p>An American woman who was detained by the Taliban alongside an elderly British couple has issued a dire warning that the pair are "literally dying" in prison and that time is running out. Faye Hall was arrested with Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 76, in February and held for two months before her release. She described their rapidly deteriorating health in harsh prison conditions, pleading with the US and UK governments to secure their release, for which no official reason has been given by the Taliban.</p>

          <p>NATO is bolstering its eastern flank with a new mission involving additional troops and fighter jets after more than a dozen Russian drones violated Polish airspace. Denmark, France, and Germany are the first to contribute aircraft to the mission, with other allies expected to join, in response to what Poland's Prime Minister called "the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two." While Moscow downplayed the incident, Warsaw insists the incursion was deliberate, prompting a significant military response from the alliance to enhance regional air defense.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece speculates that Cristiano Ronaldo's potential return to play in the United States after a 12-year absence could serve as a strategic asset for both FIFA and Donald Trump ahead of the World Cup. The author suggests Ronaldo's long absence has been linked to sexual assault allegations made against him in Las Vegas, which have since been legally resolved. A friendly match in the U.S. could signal that the environment is now favorable for his return, potentially boosting the World Cup's profile and aligning with a political climate under Trump that is more welcoming to the superstar.</p>

          <p>China's military has accused the United States and Britain of undermining regional stability by sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait, labeling the mission a "harassment and provocation." The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command stated it tracked the allied vessels and that the action sent the wrong signals regarding Taiwan's status. The U.S. and its allies describe such transits as routine freedom of navigation operations in international waters, but Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its territory, views them as a challenge to its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The Armenian village of Kirants has been physically divided by a new concrete border wall erected as part of a border demarcation process with Azerbaijan. The demarcation, based on old Soviet maps, resulted in 15 hectares of land previously part of Armenia, including some homes and farmland, being transferred to Azerbaijan. While the wall has brought a tense calm to a village that frequently came under fire during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, it has also caused economic hardship for farmers and emotional distress for residents who feel they have lost part of their homeland.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the culture surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, as revealed in his 2003 birthday book, was a continuation of a widespread societal normalization of the sexual exploitation of young girls that persisted from the 1970s through the 1990s. The author, Rebecca Solnit, recounts how movies, music, and mainstream culture of that era frequently depicted and excused relationships between adult men and underage girls. She credits the rise of feminism with challenging and changing these norms by insisting on the principles of consent, rights, and the recognition of power imbalances.</p>
