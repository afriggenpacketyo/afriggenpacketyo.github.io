          <p>Nexstar and Sinclair, two of the largest broadcast TV station owners in the U.S., announced they will not air "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's return from a suspension. The suspension was initiated by ABC's parent company, Disney, after Kimmel made controversial comments linking the killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The station groups, which control a significant number of ABC affiliates, cited the need for respectful dialogue and stated they will continue to monitor the show while discussions with ABC are ongoing. The move has drawn attention from the FCC and sparked a broader debate about free speech and media responsibility.</p>

          <p>A Missouri woman, Lisa Jeanine Findley, has been sentenced to four years and nine months in federal prison for attempting to fraudulently sell Elvis Presley's Graceland estate. Findley fabricated loan documents to falsely claim that Lisa Marie Presley had used the historic property as collateral for a $3.8 million loan. She then published a fake foreclosure notice and attempted to auction the home before being stopped by a lawsuit from Presley's granddaughter, Riley Keough. The scheme involved identity theft and an attempt to blame a Nigerian fraud ring after the plot was uncovered.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the combination of rising inflation and slowing hiring as a "challenging situation" for the U.S. economy. Speaking after the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates, Powell noted that downside risks to employment have increased, creating a difficult balancing act for policymakers. The central bank must navigate stimulating job growth without exacerbating inflation, a scenario some economists refer to as "stagflation." These economic pressures exist amid a sustained campaign by President Trump for the Fed to implement more significant rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new presidential proclamation imposes a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications, a move intended to curb misuse of the program by outsourcing firms. However, this article argues the policy is a flawed solution that could negatively impact the U.S. economy by hindering access to high-skilled foreign talent. The exorbitant fee may prevent universities and non-profits from recruiting top researchers and could reduce the overall supply of skilled workers, ultimately undermining innovation and long-term wage growth for American workers. Alternative reforms, such as prioritizing visas based on compensation rather than a lottery, are suggested as more effective solutions.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that 47% of Americans worry about their debts on a daily basis, leading to significant stress and financial avoidance behaviors like not checking bank statements. The report highlights a cycle where overwhelming debt anxiety causes people to ignore the problem, which in turn worsens their financial situation. Experts suggest several strategies to break this cycle, including prioritizing high-interest debts, negotiating directly with creditors, and seeking support from credit counseling agencies. Building small wins and creating a tangible plan are emphasized as key steps toward regaining financial control and alleviating psychological burdens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in Patagonia, Argentina, have discovered a new species of megaraptoran dinosaur, named Joaquinraptor casali. The fossil, which was found with the remains of an ancient crocodile in its jaws, provides significant insight into this lesser-known group of predators. Megaraptorans were characterized by their powerful claws and elongated skulls, and this nearly complete skeleton helps fill a major gap in the evolutionary timeline. The discovery suggests these dinosaurs used their long, powerful arms to hunt, unlike the T. rex, which relied on its massive teeth, showing there was more than one way to be a top predator during the Cretaceous period.</p>

          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July. Rent prices increased by 2.3% year-over-year, a rate below the pre-pandemic average and a significant deceleration from previous months. This cooling trend was observed across most major metropolitan areas and at all price tiers, with markets like Miami seeing no rent growth at all. The slowdown could indicate that landlords are facing pressure from struggling consumer finances. This marks a shift from the past few years when single-family rentals were in high demand due to the expensive for-sale housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump, alongside HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., made a "historic" announcement advising pregnant women against taking Tylenol and insinuating a link between vaccines, pills, and autism. The announcement has alarmed scientists and public health experts, who call the claims a dangerous distortion of facts. Researchers whose work was cited by the White House expressed concern that their nuanced findings were being used to support a misleading and simplistic narrative. Experts reiterate that no credible scientific evidence links vaccines to autism and that avoiding Tylenol for fevers during pregnancy could pose greater risks to both the mother and fetus.</p>

          <p>President Trump has abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, raising the likelihood of a government shutdown on October 1. Trump claimed the meeting would not be productive after reviewing what he called the "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democrats in their funding proposal. Democratic leaders accused the president of throwing a "tantrum" and running away from negotiations, stating that Trump will "own the shutdown." With both chambers of Congress on recess and previous funding bills failing to advance, the cancellation signals a deepening partisan divide as the funding deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are engaging in high-risk financial behaviors, a trend described as "financial nihilism." Feeling that traditional paths to wealth like homeownership are unattainable due to soaring costs, high debt, and a tight job market, they are turning to speculative investments like cryptocurrency, meme stocks, and sports betting. This approach is seen not as a long-term strategy but as a rational response to an economic system they feel is stacked against them, where "swinging for the fences" seems like the only option. This sentiment is reflected in data showing historically low consumer confidence among the 18-to-34 age group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The administration had frozen hundreds of millions in grants, citing allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled that the government likely violated federal law by not providing specific procedures or explanations for the cuts. This ruling concerns hundreds of critical medical research grants for studies on Parkinson's disease, cancer, and nerve regeneration, which the university argued were pivotal for public health.</p>

They state there is no new or robust scientific evidence to support a causal link and that paracetamol remains an important treatment option for pain and fever.

          <p>Following the recent introduction of a shocking $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, the Trump administration has proposed further changes to the program. The new proposal would revise the visa allocation system to give preference to applications from employers offering higher wages, once the annual quota of 85,000 visas is met. According to the Department of Homeland Security, this change is intended to better protect American workers from unfair wage competition from foreign labor. The move comes amid widespread uncertainty in the tech industry and has strained diplomatic ties with India, whose citizens are the primary recipients of H-1B visas.</p>

It acknowledges that Ocasio-Cortez has moderated some of her initial left-wing stances, drawing criticism from parts of her base. However, the author concludes that despite any flaws, her charisma and fighting spirit may make her the best-placed figure to lead the country out of the current political landscape.</p>
