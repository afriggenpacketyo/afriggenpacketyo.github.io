          <h2>Ukrainians Express Resolve Amidst Trump's Shifting Stance on War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As President Trump seemingly steps back from efforts to end the war in Ukraine, Ukrainians express disappointment but remain resolute in their determination to fight on, despite relentless Russian bombardments and immense personal losses. Many Ukrainians view Trump's diplomatic efforts as detached from the realities on the ground, emphasizing their need to rely on themselves and their allies. Despite disappointment in the US's stance, Ukraine aims to maintain relations with Washington, proposing a free-trade agreement. Ukrainians believe Russia is using diplomacy as a cover for intensified attacks, preparing for a summer offensive. While Ukrainians desire an end to the conflict, they believe it won't happen soon, focusing on self-reliance and increased domestic weapons production. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing pressure for a cease-fire in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to normalize relations with the United States, prioritizing trade over immediate resolution of the conflict. President Trump expressed openness to direct peace talks, but insisted on peace before economic rapprochement. This stance potentially confines Russia to economic stagnation, limiting access to Western sanctions relief and foreign investment. Putin's strategy hinges on the belief that Russia's natural resources will entice Trump to normalize relations, even without resolving the conflict in Ukraine, as Russia's military recruitment continues to exceed targets and its offensive in Ukraine intensifies, further reducing incentives for compromise. The article suggests that Putin is betting on time being on his side despite sanctions and economic challenges. </p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail announced the retailer intends to maintain current pricing levels despite tariffs, leveraging its scale and supplier partnerships. More than half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, reducing reliance on China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices due to tariffs, and Home Depot sees it as an opportunity to gain market share. CEO Ted Decker noted that high interest rates and economic uncertainty have dampened home improvement spending, with consumers focusing on smaller projects. Despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, anticipating growth driven by improved sales patterns throughout the quarter. </p>

          <p>Federal medical research grants, including those backed by former President Biden's "Cancer Moonshot" initiative, have been disrupted by Trump administration funding freezes at Columbia University and Harvard University over campus protests. Cancer scientists at Harvard report the termination of NIH funding, affecting research into breast and ovarian cancer. The cuts also impact anti-cancer immunity research at Harvard's immuno-engineering center. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited antisemitism as a reason for cuts to Columbia's funding. Senate Democrats criticize the cuts, estimating at least $15.1 million in cancer funding lost, with Sen.

          <p>Elon Musk indicated he plans to significantly reduce his political donations in the future, a notable change from his previous support for President Trump. Musk, who spent heavily in the 2024 election cycle, stated he feels he has "done enough" in terms of political spending. However, he remains open to future political involvement if he sees a reason. This decision follows a period of increased visibility and scrutiny for Musk, with public opinion of him and his companies declining. The shift also coincides with a reported decrease in his involvement with DOGE, the government-slashing initiative, as he refocuses on his businesses. </p>

The inmates broke out of the jail on Friday, and three have been recaptured since, with one more being captured on Monday. The escape went unnoticed for several hours due to a lack of assigned deputies in the area and a civilian monitor being away. </p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is defending major cuts to the foreign affairs budget before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio stated that "America is back," while Democrats warn that budget cuts and the dismantling of USAID will cede ground to China. New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen noted that while the US reduces its diplomatic workforce, China is increasing its diplomatic budget and presence. Rubio is defending a $28.5 billion foreign affairs budget, about half of what it has been in recent years. Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz suggested reforms could have been done in a more thoughtful, bipartisan way. </p>

The book highlights instances of Biden's decline, including memory lapses and confusion. Close aides are accused of insisting that the president was fine or that his health was not a major problem.

          <p>Understanding the gold-silver ratio can be a useful tool when investing in precious metals. The gold-silver ratio provides valuable information to investors about where to focus their attention and funds. The formula is based on physical gold bullion and physical silver. Investors view the ratio as an illustration of how relatively cheap or expensive silver is compared to gold. Currently, the price of silver per ounce is around $32, making it a more cost-effective option than gold, but silver tends to be more volatile compared to gold. (not investment advice) </p>
