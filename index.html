          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs. The system freezes water at night when electricity is cheaper, then uses the ice to cool buildings during the day, reducing cooling costs by up to 40%. This technology helps alleviate stress on the energy grid during peak hours and is installed in about 4,000 sites globally. Scientists are also testing new materials that require less energy to store energy for cooling purposes, aiming to make the process even more efficient.</p>

          <p>Three transgender cadets who met all U.S. Air Force Academy graduation standards were denied commissions due to a reinstated Trump administration ban. These cadets, including Hunter Marquez, are the first out transgender graduates from the Academy. Despite meeting physical endurance, academic, and military discipline standards, they were placed on administrative absence and barred from taking the oath. Academy alumni have responded with solidarity, with nearly 1,000 graduates signing an open letter defending transgender cadets and midshipmen.</p>
