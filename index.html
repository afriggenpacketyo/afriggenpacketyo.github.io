        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the efforts of the Northern Jaguar Project to conserve jaguars in Sonora, Mexico, by compensating ranchers for allowing motion cameras on their land and photographing wild cats, including jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats. This initiative, called Viviendo con Felinos, provides ranchers with financial incentives to protect these animals, effectively expanding the protected area for jaguars and their prey. The program has also fostered a cultural shift among ranchers, encouraging them to preserve the natural food chain and coexist with predators. This conservation model offers hope for the potential return of jaguars to the American Southwest, depending on maintaining openings in the border wall. Optimism is further fueled by the stable population of jaguars in the reserve and the increasing number of individuals passing through the region.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl, Kyra Hill, drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire due to gross breaches of health and safety, leading the coroner to conclude unlawful killing. The inquest revealed a lack of an emergency plan, inadequate risk assessment, and falsely reassuring warning signs about water depth. Parents were not informed of the risks, and the water's poor visibility contributed to the tragedy. The owner of the park was fined Â£80,000 in June 2024, but the girl's father is campaigning for stricter safety regulations at water parks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Spanish government is demanding the removal of nearly 66,000 Airbnb listings that violate tourist accommodation regulations, responding to increasing protests against over-tourism. This clampdown follows a Madrid court ruling that Airbnb must remove almost 5,000 properties cited by the Ministry of Social Rights, Consumer Affairs and the 2030 Agenda. The identified properties either lack a license number, provide an incorrect number, or fail to specify the owner's legal status. This action reflects growing concerns over spiraling rental costs and the deprivation of accommodation for local residents, as tourist apartments are seen as a major contributor to the housing problem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against altering Medicaid during a closed-door meeting, urging them to pass a tax bill. His blunt message was directed at a faction of Republicans seeking cuts to the Medicaid program and the addition of work requirements for eligibility. Critics argue that such work requirements would create a bureaucratic burden, requiring extensive verification of employment status for millions of people. Medicaid, jointly funded by the federal government and states, provides healthcare coverage to nearly 80 million Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to normalize relations with Russia are facing challenges as he insists on resolving the war in Ukraine before pursuing economic rapprochement. Despite President Putin's desire to end the war on his terms and his ability to withstand pressure for an immediate cease-fire, Trump has linked American economic engagement with Russia to achieving peace in Ukraine. This stance could delay Russia's hopes for sanctions relief and foreign investment, as Trump emphasizes that large-scale trade with the United States will only occur after the conflict ends. The Kremlin acknowledges discussions on bilateral relations but underscores the commitment to a broader reset, viewing Russia as a crucial trade partner.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated his commitment to remain as CEO of Tesla for the next five years, addressing speculation about his future role within the company. This announcement comes at a time when Tesla faces significant consumer and stock price pressures, partly due to Musk's involvement with President Trump's administration. The statement follows reports suggesting that Tesla's board members had considered searching for a new CEO, which the company's chair, Robyn Denholm, has firmly denied. Musk's dedication aims to reassure investors and stakeholders about the stability of Tesla's leadership.</p>

Musk's involvement in the Trump administration, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency, has drawn scrutiny and impacted his companies, particularly Tesla.

          <p>Elon Musk's participation in President Trump's visit to the Persian Gulf has raised ethical concerns as his companies secured lucrative deals in the region. While accompanying Trump, Musk announced that SpaceX received approval to provide Starlink services in Saudi Arabia and Neuralink would conduct a clinical trial in Abu Dhabi. These deals follow years of Musk's companies raising funds from government-linked entities in the Gulf, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, Musk's family members have also secured agreements in the region, further intertwining their business interests with the autocratic monarchies.</p>

The judge described Ebid as ruthlessly exploiting desperate individuals, with his primary motivation being to profit from human trafficking.

The airline is demanding the money back after the union won a court case nullifying a pay deal agreed with another union.

While Republicans on the committee supported the changes, Democratic Senator Brian Schatz criticized the administration's approach as lacking thoughtful, bipartisan input. The reforms involve reorganizing and downsizing the State Department and considering the closure of some foreign missions.</p>
