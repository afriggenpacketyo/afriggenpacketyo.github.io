          <p>The UK's newspapers present varied perspectives on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spending Review. Some headlines warn of impending tax increases to support NHS spending, while others criticize the review as a reckless spending spree that future generations will pay for. Some papers commend the plans for prioritizing ordinary citizens, while others express concern over cuts to the Home Office and the potential impact on policing. The review has sparked debate about whether it represents a genuine investment in Britain's future or a politically motivated attempt to win votes. Optimism surrounding the plans are mixed, with some questioning the feasibility of efficiency savings and the potential for economic growth to offset the increased spending.

          <p>A former U.S. nuclear cruise missile launch site in Okinawa has been reopened to the public, shedding light on the island's dark past during the Cold War. The Mace B cruise missile site, one of four built in the 1960s, serves as a reminder of the U.S. military occupation and the deployment of nuclear weapons in Okinawa. The missiles stationed there, with a range of over 2,000 kilometers, were capable of striking China and parts of the Soviet Union. The reopening aims to educate the public about this history and the ongoing concerns regarding missile deployment in the region.</p>

          <p>Japan continues to lag behind other G7 countries in gender equality, ranking 118th out of 148 nations in the 2025 gender gap report. The World Economic Forum report highlights Japan's poor political participation by women and its slow progress in closing the gender gap. While there has been some improvement in women's economic participation, the country remains low in female participation in management positions. The report estimates that it will take 123 years to achieve full gender parity globally.</p>
