          <p>The FBI executed search warrants on the Maryland residence and Washington D.C. office of John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump, as part of an ongoing national security investigation into classified records. This probe, initiated during the Biden administration but gaining traction under Trump's second term, aims to uncover instances of classified document leaks to news organizations. Bolton, a vocal critic of Trump, had previously faced a Justice Department lawsuit over his memoir, "The Room Where it Happened," alleging a breach of classified agreements. The raids highlight the intensified legal scrutiny on former officials regarding the handling of sensitive government information, with top law enforcement figures publicly asserting that no one is above the law, reflecting a commitment to upholding national security protocols.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly stated his intention to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she does not resign, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, is currently facing a Department of Justice investigation after a criminal referral from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte. Trump's potential removal of Cook "for cause" would allow him to appoint a replacement, thereby reshaping the central bank's governing board and potentially influencing monetary policy for years. Cook has firmly rejected the pressure, asserting her commitment to her role and vowing not to be intimidated by the accusations. This situation highlights significant political pressure on the Federal Reserve's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

Ahmed, also a rapper and Oscar winner for his short film "The Long Goodbye," discussed how becoming a father has deeply influenced his artistry, making him realize the extent to which loved ones co-author one's work. He is currently promoting his new summer thriller, "Relay," where he portrays Ash, a loner who facilitates payoffs between whistleblowers and corrupt entities, a role he describes as reminiscent of classic, edge-of-your-seat thrillers.</p>

          <p>Revolution Beauty, a struggling fashion brand, has reinstated its co-founders, Adam Minto and Tom Allsworth, to "reset" the business after failing to find a suitable buyer. The company, which reported a 25.5% drop in sales and a pre-tax loss of £16.8 million, aims to raise approximately £15 million by issuing new shares and plans further cost savings, including staff cuts. Minto and Allsworth, who previously resigned due to accounting irregularities and undisclosed personal loans, are now tasked with implementing a "new and refreshed strategy" to return the cosmetics firm to long-term profitability. This move is seen as a bet on the founders' track record to rebuild the brand's past success and popularity. (not investment advice)</p>

Parsons, who is entering the final season of his five-year rookie contract and seeking a new deal around $40 million annually, has been staging a "hold-in" and previously requested a trade, emphasizing the need for his agent's presence. Jones stated the offered deal would have made Parsons the highest-paid guaranteed player in the NFL, excluding quarterbacks, highlighting the public fallout of the dispute.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his speech at the annual Jackson Hole gathering, characterized the current economic landscape as a "challenging situation," balancing a hiring slowdown with tariff-driven price increases. Powell noted the "clearly visible" effects of tariffs on consumer prices, expecting them to accumulate in coming months, while also observing a "shifting balance of risks" that "may warrant adjusting our policy stance." This statement was widely interpreted by futures markets as a strong indication of potential interest rate cuts at the Fed's next meeting. The central bank faces the bind of stimulating the economy without worsening inflation, all while navigating persistent political pressure from President Trump for rate reductions, emphasizing the importance of the Fed's independence.

          <p>Lebanon's Hezbollah militia has definitively rejected calls for its disarmament, explicitly warning of a "civil war" if the government attempts to enforce a state monopoly on weapons. This rejection stands in defiance of UN resolutions and a recent agreement by Palestinian and Lebanese leaders to consolidate arms under state control. Hezbollah's leader, Naim Kassem, contends that disarmament primarily serves US and Israeli interests, thereby exposing Lebanon to severe crisis. Despite being weakened by recent conflicts with Israel and a decline in international backing, the militia views its weapons as essential for its political survival, underscoring profound internal divisions within Lebanon regarding its continued armed presence and influence.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez is scheduled for a parole board hearing in California, occurring a day after his brother Erik's bid for release was denied. Both brothers were convicted in 1995 for the 1989 murders of their parents and initially received life sentences without parole, which were later reduced to 50 years to life, making them eligible under California's youth offender law. They consistently claim self-defense, citing years of alleged physical, sexual, and emotional abuse from their parents. However, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman publicly opposes their release, contending they have not fully accepted responsibility for their actions. Erik's parole denial was notably attributed to his behavior in prison, rather than the original crimes.</p>

The Palestinian Authority's weakened state, exacerbated by Israel's withholding of customs revenues, has led to unpaid security forces and a surge in crime across the territory.

          <p>This article directly challenges President Donald Trump's recent criticism of the Smithsonian Institution's portrayal of slavery as "bad," which he labeled "woke." The author, a descendant of enslaved people, asserts the crucial importance of truthfully recounting the immense horrors of chattel slavery, which endured for nearly 250 years in America. Drawing upon compelling first-person accounts from formerly enslaved individuals, the article vividly details the unremitting physical, psychological, and sexual violence, forced family separations, and profound economic disparities that continue to impact Black Americans. It argues that a comprehensive understanding of this painful history is not only essential for national self-reflection but also vital for the country to evolve into its aspired version.</p>

          <h2>Unusual Wage Growth Trend Signals Potential Weakness in US Labor Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US labor market is displaying an unusual wage growth trend in 2025, with "job stayers" experiencing faster annual wage increases than "job switchers," a reversal previously observed only during periods of economic weakness such as the Great Recession. This sustained phenomenon, evident for the past six months, points to a "frozen" labor market where workers are less inclined to voluntarily leave their positions for new, higher-paying roles due to economic uncertainty. Economists attribute this to a decline in job openings and a reduction in workers' bargaining power, indicating a gradual cooling from the robust pace of recent years. Additionally, long-term unemployment is rising, compelling some jobless individuals to accept lower-wage employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his high-profile libel case against The Guardian, which had published extensive allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the newspaper successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest, concluding the core meaning of the articles was "substantially true." The judge explicitly found Clarke to be "not a credible or reliable witness" and rejected his assertion of an "unlawful conspiracy" by the more than 20 women who testified against him. The Guardian's editor-in-chief welcomed the decision as a "deserved victory for those women who suffered" and a significant landmark for investigative journalism.</p>

          <p>John Deere is at a critical juncture, grappling with significantly weaker demand in the agricultural sector, which has resulted in notable year-over-year decreases in net income and sales. The company recently announced 238 layoffs, adding to thousands over the past year, directly attributing these reductions to decreased demand and lower order volumes. Despite these immediate challenges, Deere is committed to a "bold move," investing $20 billion into U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, partly to reinforce its "Made in the USA" credentials amidst political pressure. Analysts, however, express optimism for a future rebound, citing growth in Europe and South America, and view the current cost-cutting measures as a disciplined strategy within a cyclical industry.

          <p>This article provides an explainer on the implications of US warships operating near Venezuela, specifically focusing on the impact on the global oil trade. Venezuela possesses the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at 303 billion barrels, which represents 17% of global reserves. However, its actual production remains significantly constrained by US sanctions imposed on its state oil company, PDVSA, since 2019. Despite these restrictions, Reuters reported a 15% year-on-year increase in PDVSA's crude oil and fuel exports in 2024. The presence of US naval assets introduces a heightened geopolitical dimension to Venezuela's substantial oil prominence, prompting concerns about potential disruptions and the future trajectory of its energy sector.
