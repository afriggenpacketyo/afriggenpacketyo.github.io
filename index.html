          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 104 deaths, with a significant tragedy occurring at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp for girls. The camp has confirmed that at least 27 of its campers and counselors are among the deceased, while search and rescue operations continue for several others who remain missing. The catastrophic event, which saw the Guadalupe River rise with unprecedented speed, has prompted a major disaster declaration and a massive response from state and federal authorities. Officials and families are grappling with the immense loss while also dealing with scams targeting the victims' relatives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas were caused by a confluence of extreme weather and regional geography, with some areas receiving over 20 inches of rain. Remnant moisture from Tropical Storm Barry combined with other weather systems to create slow-moving, intense storms over the Texas Hill Country. This region is naturally susceptible to flash flooding due to its dry, packed soil and steep terrain, which causes rapid runoff. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and catching residents and campers by surprise in the pre-dawn hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in President Trump's recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targeted federal funding for organizations providing abortions. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the provision was an unconstitutional attempt to single out the organization and would severely impact its ability to provide non-abortion healthcare services, such as cancer screenings, to its patients. The White House stated the policy aims to stop taxpayer funding for elective abortions.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally rejected a demand from the Trump administration to prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. The federal Office for Civil Rights had determined that California's inclusive policy violated the rights of female students under its interpretation of Title IX and gave the state a deadline to comply. By refusing, California risks an unspecified "imminent enforcement action," which could include the withholding of federal funds. The conflict highlights the deep national divide over the interpretation of civil rights laws and their application to transgender students in school athletics.</p>

          <p>The deadly Texas floods are raising serious questions about the adequacy of the state's emergency warning systems and the impact of potential staffing cuts at the National Weather Service. Local officials have stated the area lacks a robust flood warning system, with previous proposals stalled due to cost concerns. While the NWS issued alerts, some residents reported not receiving them or being desensitized to frequent warnings. This has led to a debate over whether understaffing at local NWS offices, a result of federal budget cuts, compromised the ability to effectively communicate the unprecedented threat to local emergency managers and the public.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas serve as a stark warning for California, which faces similar dangers from extreme weather events, according to experts. Like Texas, California has hilly topography and numerous low-lying areas along rivers that are vulnerable to rapid inundation, as seen in past floods and debris flows. Climate scientists note that while the storm types may differ, the potential for sudden, catastrophic flooding from events like intense atmospheric rivers is a significant risk for the state. The Texas tragedy underscores the importance of understanding flood-hazard zones and having effective risk awareness and timely warning systems in place.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against major selling in response to President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on 14 countries, suggesting the declared rates may not be final.

While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, Cramer believes the ultimate goal is to boost U.S. exports rather than to erect permanent trade barriers, and that the tariffs may not significantly impact inflation or Federal Reserve policy.

The operation, part of the Trump administration's ramped-up immigration enforcement, caused alarm and disruption but appeared to result in no arrests before the agents abruptly withdrew.

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the Trump administration's foreign and defense policy, suggesting it is being run with little coherent direction from the top. It argues that with President Trump's interest being episodic and key cabinet positions filled by individuals with limited power or experience, critical decisions are being driven by lower-level, unelected officials like Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby. This has led to confusing and contradictory actions, such as halting weapons to Ukraine and reviewing the AUKUS pact without clear presidential guidance. The piece concludes that this dysfunction creates a dangerous void in leadership on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The small Australian town of Korumburra is struggling to find closure following the conviction of Erin Patterson for murdering three of her former in-laws with poisonous mushrooms. The case, which garnered global attention, has left a somber mood in the tight-knit community where the victims were well-known and beloved figures. Locals express a desire to move on from the tragedy and the intense media spotlight, which they feel turned their community's grief into "pop culture." The trial has deeply affected the region, rattling the close ties between several small towns and leaving residents to process the shocking crime that took place in their midst.</p>

          <p>As part of its response to the ongoing trade war with the United States, China is implementing a long-term "strategic hinterland" strategy that focuses on developing its interior provinces. Guizhou, historically one of the nation's poorest regions, is being positioned to play a key role in this national plan, which aims to reshape China's economic and industrial landscape. Provincial leaders are seizing the opportunity to align with the national goal of building a more resilient and self-sufficient economy. This approach involves leveraging the comparative advantages of these inland areas to serve as a secure backbone for the country amidst external economic pressures.</p>

          <p>Automaker Nissan is reportedly in discussions with Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn for a potential partnership to produce electric vehicles. According to reports, the deal could involve Foxconn manufacturing EVs at Nissan's Oppama plant in Japan, a historic facility that has been facing the threat of closure due to low production rates under Nissan's restructuring plan. Such an arrangement could save thousands of jobs and preserve a key part of Nissan's supplier network by offloading the plant's excess capacity. For Foxconn, a deal would represent a major step in its ambition to become a significant contract manufacturer in the growing electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The White House and Senator Ted Cruz are pushing back against criticism of the National Weather Service's handling of the deadly Texas floods, labeling such claims as partisan politics. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt asserted that claims of understaffing or forecasting failures are "falsehoods," detailing a timeline of alerts issued by the NWS and noting that local offices had extra staff on duty. This defense comes in response to Democrats, like Senator Chuck Schumer, who have called for an investigation into whether federal workforce cuts under the Trump administration contributed to the catastrophic loss of life by hampering the agency's capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that steep new tariffs will be imposed on imports from at least 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia, starting August 1. The president revealed the new duties, which range from 25% to 40%, in a series of letters posted to social media, citing the need to correct persistent trade deficits. The announcement comes as a previous 90-day pause on so-called "reciprocal tariffs" was set to expire. The letters warn the targeted nations against retaliation and suggest the new tariff levels could be adjusted based on the bilateral relationship with each country.</p>

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals in a match that ended with a heartbreaking injury to his opponent, Grigor Dimitrov.

A tearful Dimitrov was forced to retire, marking the fifth consecutive Grand Slam where he has withdrawn due to injury. Sinner, who showed immediate concern for his friend, stated he could not accept the outcome "as a win," instead expressing his sadness for Dimitrov's misfortune in what was an unfortunate end to a compelling match.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom government has announced it will ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. The change will be made through an amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, which is expected to become law this year. This reform will render void any confidentiality clauses that seek to prevent workers from speaking out about such allegations. The move follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, who broke her NDA against Harvey Weinstein, and aims to end the practice of using legal agreements to cover up abuse and criminality.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano on Flores island erupted twice on Monday, launching a column of ash and volcanic material up to 11 miles into the sky. The powerful eruptions have dumped ash on surrounding villages, blocked out sunlight, and prompted the cancellation of dozens of international and domestic flights, primarily affecting routes to and from Bali. The volcano has been at the highest alert level since June, with authorities expanding the exclusion zone around the crater. Officials are also warning residents to be vigilant for potential lava flows if heavy rains occur in the area.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis explores whether staffing cuts at the National Weather Service under the Trump administration contributed to the Texas flood tragedy. While the NWS workforce has been reduced by about 600 people since January, climate experts interviewed for the article stated that the forecasts and warnings for this specific event were largely adequate. However, some experts raised concerns that vacancies in key roles, such as a "warning coordinating meteorologist" in the San Antonio office, may have hindered effective communication between the NWS and local emergency services. The White House has firmly denied that staffing issues played any role in the disaster.</p>
