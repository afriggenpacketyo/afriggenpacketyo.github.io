          <p>Israel has launched Operation Gideon Chariots, a major military operation in Gaza, aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages. This escalation follows days of intensive strikes that have resulted in numerous casualties, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The operation coincides with ongoing Qatari and Egyptian-led negotiations in Doha to broker a ceasefire and hostage exchange, supported by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. Meanwhile, a severe humanitarian crisis persists in Gaza, marked by dwindling supplies of food, fuel, and medicine due to an ongoing blockade. International organizations warn of impending famine, with thousands of children suffering from malnutrition, as negotiations continue to seek a resolution to the conflict and alleviate the dire conditions for civilians. </p>

          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, is being investigated as an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI. The blast resulted in one fatality and several injuries, causing significant damage to nearby buildings. According to the mayor, the explosion originated in or near a vehicle parked by the clinic, though the exact details remain unclear, with only an axle remaining at the scene. The clinic reported that its staff and stored genetic materials were unharmed and emphasized its commitment to safety and resuming normal operations soon. The surrounding area, known for its proximity to healthcare facilities and a bustling downtown, was heavily affected by the blast, with authorities working to determine if it was an act of domestic or international terrorism. The FBI characterized it as one of the largest bombing investigations in Southern California. The incident has sparked concerns about the politicization of in vitro fertilization within the broader debate on reproductive rights.</p>

          <p>Two prominent far-right figures, David Clews and Mark Collett, have announced a strategy to infiltrate Nigel Farage's Reform UK party to promote extremist views. Clews and Collett aim to push a "pro-white" and anti-immigration agenda by encouraging their supporters to become active members and organizers within Reform. They claim that some sympathizers are already in the party, holding positions such as branch chairs and candidate list members. A Reform spokesman stated that the far-right is not welcome in the party and that there is a stringent vetting process in place. The pair have signed a "declaration of intent" to "drag Reform to the right," which includes reducing immigration and mass deportations to ensure the British Isles remain a super majority.</p>

After breaking out of his crate and scaling a fence, George traveled three miles through several subdivisions and around lakes to return home. His owner, Bob Beasock, expressed relief and humor, while a cat behavioral specialist suggested George's return was likely due to a combination of scent, visual markers, and geomagnetism. The article highlights the strong attachment cats can have with their owners and their evolved ability to find their way back home.

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had warned that tariffs on imported goods could lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump insisted that Walmart, which made billions in profits, should absorb the costs to protect customers and support his economic agenda. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company would strive to keep prices low despite the challenges posed by tariffs. The article reflects the tension between the Trump administration's trade policies and the concerns of major American companies about the impact on consumers and supply chains.</p>

The hackers shared evidence of stolen customer and employee data, leading Co-op to acknowledge a major data breach. The hackers are believed to be associated with a cybercrime service called DragonForce, which offers ransomware-as-a-service. DragonForce, recently rebranded as a cartel, provides cyber criminal affiliates with various services in exchange for a percentage of ransoms collected. The group's darknet website was recently hacked by a rival gang, illustrating the ongoing power struggles within the cybercrime ecosystem.</p>

Gove emphasized that the UK is a "living thing" and politicians must continually demonstrate that the union is working. Swinney has also called for "demonstrable support" for independence, similar to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament. Gove, however, stressed that any decision on a second referendum would be up to the Westminster government and linked its likelihood to the SNP's ability to improve public services.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have garnered a new wave of sympathy and support, largely due to shifting cultural perceptions influenced by TikTok, Netflix, and advocates like Kim Kardashian.

A Los Angeles judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, and their fate now rests with California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and those over 12 with high-risk medical conditions, prompting criticism from medical experts. The approval requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart conditions associated with the vaccine, which could cost the company tens of millions of dollars. This decision marks the first time the FDA has included health criteria for COVID-19 shots, a move typically made by the CDC. Experts worry that these restrictions could limit vaccine access and reflect skepticism about vaccines from key health officials, potentially undermining public health efforts.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that 81% of Japanese people feel "more uneasy than hopeful" about U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, primarily due to concerns over tariffs and his unpredictable actions. While 42% cited the threat that tariffs pose to free trade, 41% pointed to his unpredictable actions. Conversely, 57% of the 17% who expressed "more hope than unease" praised Trump's "leadership," and 33% lauded his "attempts to oppose an increasingly hegemonic China." The survey also indicates that 47% believe Japan should emphasize ties with the United States, while 48% prefer maintaining equal relations with both the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>A local government's promotion of a bridge in Fuji, Japan, as an ideal photo spot for Mt. Fuji has backfired, leading to complaints from residents about disruptions caused by tourists. The "Mt. Fuji dream bridge" now attracts around 1,000 visitors daily, resulting in illegal parking, noise, and trespassing on private property. Despite the city's efforts to manage the influx with signs and free parking, residents are frustrated, and a tourism professor criticized the local government's response as insufficient.

          <p>President Trump endorsed the idea that the Supreme Court’s decision to temporarily block his administration from deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act was “illegal”. Trump reposted comments made by attorney Mike Davis calling the court’s decision an “illegal injunction”. Trump also re-posted a comment from Davis suggesting the court was being unfair to him. He has lashed out at federal judges for ruling against him in dozens of cases. This is part of a recent trend where Trump is attacking federal judges for ruling against him in various cases. </p>
