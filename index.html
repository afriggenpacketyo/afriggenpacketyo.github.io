          <p>Authorities are actively searching for the individual responsible for shooting and killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The suspect, described as a male appearing to be college-aged, remains at large despite an ongoing manhunt and the recovery of a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used. Investigators are analyzing video footage, palm prints, and other forensic evidence collected from the scene, and the FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator. Utah's governor has indicated the state will pursue the death penalty in this case, which officials consider a targeted attack, and the investigation continues with the assistance of the FBI and U.S. Marshals. </p>

The company's stock rose over 7%, marking its ninth consecutive day of gains, contributing to a broader rally in Asian markets, while Alibaba and Baidu saw their shares jump after deploying in-house AI training chips. Easing inflation and expectations of U.S. rate cuts are boosting investor sentiment, and overnight gains on Wall Street saw the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite reach new intraday and closing record highs. The CPI reading showed a slightly higher increase than expected, but markets remain optimistic about future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over two million people have been evacuated in Pakistan's Punjab province due to severe flooding, with an additional 150,000 evacuated in Sindh province, and monsoon rains have caused over 900 deaths nationwide since late June. Climate change is exacerbating the floods, compounded by a lack of government investment in disaster mitigation infrastructure, which has devastated farms and houses, severely impacting residents, many of whom live below the poverty line. Rescue efforts are underway, but face challenges such as strong currents, and the UN has allocated $5 million to support Pakistan's flood response, with the US State Department also providing assistance. Pakistani authorities have declared a climate emergency and are planning to address climate change challenges in the coming months.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the National Audit Office reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, while many children still do not receive appropriate care. Councils spent an average of £318,400 per child in children's homes in the year ending March 2024, totaling £3.1 billion on residential placements, but the report describes the market as "dysfunctional". Rising costs are attributed to a record number of children in care, the increasing complexity of their needs, and a profit-driven market, with councils struggling to find appropriate placements and private providers cherry-picking children based on profitability. The Department for Education stated it is driving the largest ever reform of children's social care to address these issues.</p>

The Sparks, already out of postseason contention, aimed to finish with a winning record, but the Aces' talent proved too much to overcome, despite efforts from Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum. The game was marked by physical play, including an injury to Cameron Brink, and in the third quarter, Sparks coach Lynne Roberts gave rookies Sarah Ashlee Barker, Alissa Pili, and Sania Feagin playing time. The Aces dominated, highlighting the talent gap between the two teams.</p>

          <p>Friday's newspapers are dominated by the sacking of Lord Mandelson as US ambassador, with questions raised about Prime Minister's judgement. The Daily Mail and Guardian highlight concerns about Mandelson's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, while the Daily Express accuses the Prime Minister of weakness in backing an unfit candidate. The Daily Telegraph reports that Baroness Gray initially deemed Mandelson unsuitable for the role, and the Times notes Mandelson felt ill-treated by the decision, while the Sun features a chilling image of the suspect in the Charlie Kirk murder. The Financial Times discusses the rise of political violence in the US, and the Daily Mirror quotes a Labour MP calling for Mandelson to resign from the House of Lords.</p>

          <p>Despite threats from President Trump to send federal troops to Portland, Oregon, to quell protests, Mayor Keith Wilson insists that such intervention is unnecessary. Protests outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building continue, though they are less intense than the unrest following George Floyd's murder in 2020, and Trump has described living in Portland as "like living in hell". Violent crime has actually declined in Portland, and many residents feel the protests are being exaggerated, while the mayor said the city has protected freedom of expression while addressing violence and property destruction. A charter school relocated due to safety concerns, and some residents have sued over noise and disruptions.</p>

The proposed legislation allows terminally ill adults with fewer than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval by two doctors and a panel of a social worker, legal figure, and psychiatrist. Baroness Berger has proposed an amendment calling for further evidence from professionals and ministers, and a Lords committee has raised concerns about the level of scrutiny given to the bill. Lord Falconer said the Commons has decided there should be assisted dying and the Lords should respect that decision.</p>

The crackdown appeals to Trump's base but undermines the industrial policy goals, and the US faces challenges in attracting and retaining the workforce needed to support its manufacturing ambitions.

          <p>As the multilateral system falters, the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is presented as a critical solution for the global order's ailments, and the United Nations is increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade wars, with the Global South marginalized in decision-making. The article argues that new governance approaches are urgently needed to avoid further fragmentation, and the SCO embodies the five principles, providing a platform for countries of different cultures, ideologies, and political systems to cooperate. The SCO is seen as a response to states raising tariffs and undermining global institutions, while others call for reform but fail to deliver.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump last September, began with the judge halting Routh's opening statement due to philosophical musings and irrelevant remarks. Routh, representing himself, faces five charges, including attempted assassination, and the prosecution argued that Routh tried to take the choice away from the American people by plotting to kill Trump. A Secret Service agent testified about discovering Routh near Trump's golf course with a weapon, and another witness identified Routh fleeing the scene. The jury heard audio of the agent radioing colleagues after firing shots, and Routh told a witness that they are his hero.</p>

          <p>The father of Vadim Kruglov, who was mysteriously killed at Burning Man, has appealed to President Trump to have the FBI investigate the case, as reported by Russian media. Kruglov, 37, was found dead on August 30, and the Pershing County Sheriff’s Office is leading the homicide investigation but has released limited information. The father, Igor Kruglov, lamented that the investigation is being conducted by a single local sheriff, while friends of the victim have been sharing similar messages on Instagram. The Pershing County Sheriff’s Office declined to comment on the reports of the father’s appeal or the manner in which Kruglov was killed.</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged his supporters to respond peacefully to the killing of Charlie Kirk, after initially blaming the "radical left" for the assassination. Trump agreed with a suggestion from a conservative reporter that his supporters should not respond with violence, emphasizing that Kirk was an advocate of nonviolence. The president cited "big progress" in the investigation, while authorities continue the search for the gunman responsible for Kirk's death at a Utah university. This article provides a brief overview of the day's key developments surrounding the Trump administration's response to the Charlie Kirk shooting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A moment of silence for Charlie Kirk on Capitol Hill devolved into a partisan shouting match after a request to pray for Kirk led to objections from Democrats, and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna accused Democrats of contributing to Kirk's killing through "hateful rhetoric". Lawmakers of both parties publicly denounced the assassination, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune called for respect and protection for all individuals. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also condemned the shooting, and President Trump released a video blaming the violent act on the "radical left". The incident underscores the deep partisan tensions surrounding the issue of political violence.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions report that more children are starting school without essential skills like speaking in full sentences or using the toilet independently, and a survey indicates a third of teachers have at least five children in their reception class needing help with toilet training. Nine in ten teachers have observed a decline in speech and language abilities among new starters in the past two years, which is attributed to social isolation and increased screen time. The government aims for 75% of children to reach a good level of development by the end of reception in 2028, and schools are urged to budget for speech and language therapists. A spokesperson said that the government was working to ensure that a record share of children are "school-ready" at the age of five.</p>

          <p>Child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers advice on managing fussy eating, emphasizing that it's a normal part of development and advising parents not to blame themselves. The tips include allowing children to choose what they eat, avoiding labeling food as good or bad, prioritizing enjoyment during mealtimes, being mindful of appetite, and involving children in food preparation. Charlotte suggests allowing children to make their own decisions about eating and leaving the table when they want, while parents should model moderation and balance. She also recommends creating a fun and engaging environment at the dinner table, and seeking professional help if concerned about a child's limited diet or sensory issues.</p>

Escobar reported seeing about 1,500 people inside and expressed concerns about the food quality and lack of information provided to detainees, while requests for access to the facility and comments from DHS and ICE officials were denied.

The album has received mixed reviews, with some praising its enjoyable tunes and others finding it lacks depth and adventure, while Sheeran's lyrics are noted for their simplicity and unguarded nature.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military strike on a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, claimed to be carrying drugs, occurred after the boat had turned around and was heading back to shore, raising questions about the legality and justification for the attack. National security officials acknowledged the boat was fired on multiple times after changing course, and Democratic senators are demanding more information from the Trump administration, arguing that the military is not a law enforcement agency. The Trump administration has cited self-defense as the legal justification, while Venezuela has accused the U.S. government of murder and questioned the identification of those on board as gang members.
