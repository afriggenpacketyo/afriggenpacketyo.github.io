          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Dalian, China, called for international collaboration on trade despite rising tariffs and barriers. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and urged countries not to politicize or securitize trade. Li stated that engaging in the international economy involves "reshaping the rules and order" and encouraged countries to stay on the "right" path. Adam Tooze, a Columbia University professor, interpreted Li's comments as a move towards a "pluralization" of global order, focusing on processes rather than a single entity setting the order. The premier did not specifically address U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict. Optimism surrounding global economic collaboration is tempered by existing geopolitical challenges.</p>

Randolph Bracy expressed disappointment, noting his family's long history of service in central Florida.

          <p>The article discusses the possibility of the US and Iran restarting nuclear negotiations, while also addressing conflicting reports about the impact of US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. An initial US intelligence assessment suggests the strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months, contradicting President Trump's claim of complete obliteration. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the assessment as "flat-out wrong," while Trump maintained that Iran's nuclear sites are "completely destroyed." The extent of the damage remains unclear, but the article highlights the ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on the effectiveness of the strikes.</p>

          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to use the yuan amid faltering international confidence in the U.S. dollar, aiming to challenge the greenback's dominance. Recent moves include establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and systemic opacity have discouraged large-scale asset purchases. China is also promoting bilateral trade settlement in yuan and has developed a network of offshore yuan clearing banks to encourage its use in global payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State assemblyman Zohran Mamdani achieved a significant political upset by defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, conceded to Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist. The primary in New York, a reliably liberal city, is expected to determine the next mayor in November's election. Mamdani's victory is seen as a reflection of New York Democrats' desire for leaders who demonstrate enthusiasm and courage, especially in the context of Donald Trump's presidency.</p>

Cuomo, seeking a comeback after a sexual harassment scandal, is emphasizing his experience and moderate stance, though critics point to his past controversies. The race is seen as a test for the Democratic Party as it seeks to define its direction after recent election losses.

          <h2>Initial Intel Assessment Finds Trump's Strikes on Iran Set Back Nuclear Program by Months</h2>

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) found that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by only a matter of months. The strikes sealed off entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, but the DIA assessment indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved beforehand. The White House has disputed the assessment, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it "flat-out wrong." President Trump has maintained that the nuclear sites are "completely destroyed." The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence.</p>

          <p>According to the UK's Climate Change Committee, more people are purchasing electric cars and installing heat pumps, but further increases are necessary to meet climate goals. The committee emphasizes the need for the government to ensure households benefit from the transition to cleaner technologies through reduced bills. While electric car sales have nearly doubled in the past two years, and heat pump sales are growing, both remain below target. The CCC also suggests making electricity cheaper by removing charges that support older renewable energy projects, which would incentivize the use of electric vehicles and heat pumps.</p>

Higuera had crossed into the U.S. illegally at age 15 and worked in garment factories, contributing to the economy and paying taxes.

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into star formation. Using data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides evidence that the Milky Way's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study galactic evolution.</p>
