            <p>Kenan Malik argues that Donald Trump's efforts to impose political authority over academic life at Harvard University, by demanding viewpoint diversity through politically-motivated hiring practices, are misguided. Malik contends that while viewpoint diversity is important, Trump's approach resembles a pernicious form of identity politics that undermines scholarly objectivity. He suggests that true intellectual engagement requires encouraging the capacity to move between different points of view, rather than institutionalizing political identities or imposing state mandates.</p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after a 24-hour suspension due to track-switching work aimed at improving access to Haneda airport. The work involved platform expansion at Tamachi Station and relocation of nearby tracks to prepare for a new line directly connecting central Tokyo and the airport. The new route, operated by East Japan Railway Co. (JR East), is scheduled to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031.</p>
