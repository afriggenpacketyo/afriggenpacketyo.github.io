          <p>Walmart's CFO warned investors that the retail giant will raise prices on many items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reprieve on duties from China. The company is trying to navigate the situation, but the speed and magnitude of price increases are unprecedented. While Walmart will absorb some costs, shoppers will likely see increases towards the end of May and more in June, with toys and electronics being heavily impacted. Walmart is also taking steps to reduce tariff exposure, such as switching to alternative materials and sourcing merchandise from different locations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. However, the plan requires both parents to have a Social Security number, potentially excluding 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present. The credit is partially refundable, providing up to $1,700 even if a family owes no federal taxes. The tax break starts to phase out for higher-income couples with AGI exceeding $400,000. The proposal is being debated for its impact on low-income families.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning President Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship, focusing on whether a single district court judge can block a policy nationwide. The justices did not consider the legal merits of the order itself, which seeks to deny citizenship to babies born to undocumented migrants, but rather the use of universal injunctions. Several justices expressed skepticism about the legality of Trump's proclamation, with Justice Sotomayor stating that it violated multiple Supreme Court precedents. The justices also explored the history and practical implications of nationwide injunctions, with concerns raised about potential chaos if different states followed different rules.</p>

The legislation aims to level the playing field and address systemic disadvantages, but faces pushback from Republicans, with one lawmaker proposing to defund jurisdictions that enact reparations policies.</p>

The U.S. aims to help establish a peaceful, stable Syria, encouraged by calls for peaceful relations with Israel and the expulsion of terrorists.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's request to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship. The court considered whether individual district court judges can single-handedly block presidential policies nationwide. Arguments focused on the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, with the solicitor general arguing it was meant for children of former slaves, not those of illegal immigrants. Justices questioned whether eliminating nationwide injunctions could leave unlawful orders in place too long.

          <h2>Belgium Scraps Nuclear Phaseout Plan Amid Energy Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 15:23:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Belgium's parliament voted to abandon its planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a policy adopted over two decades ago. The decision follows a 2022 delay prompted by energy uncertainty due to Russia's war in Ukraine. The move aims to create a realistic and resilient energy model. Belgium currently has two nuclear power plants, which contribute about 40% of the country's power generation. Other European countries are also considering shifts in nuclear policy, reflecting concerns about energy security and sustainability.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the controversy surrounding President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million jet from Qatar, arguing that it is part of a broader pattern of Qatari influence-peddling in the U.S. and beyond. It notes that Qatar has funded American universities, think tanks, and politicians across the political spectrum. The article contrasts this with pro-Israel lobbying, arguing that the latter is driven by American citizens, while Qatar's influence relies on financial investment. The author concludes that Qatar's actions are designed to launder its reputation and gain influence in the U.S.</p>

The streets of Khan Younis were filled with funeral processions, with reports of the deadliest air strikes in the city in months.

While the administration has granted refugee status to white South Africans, it is also challenging birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants. The administration is considering policies to encourage people to have more children, but it has also taken a hardline stance against immigrants from the Global South and their children. Experts say that these policies appear to be motivated by a desire to satisfy a political base that seeks a white Christian nationalist nation.</p>

He has engaged in direct talks with Israel's adversaries without their input, reflecting a skepticism about allies and a focus on deals with Gulf states.
