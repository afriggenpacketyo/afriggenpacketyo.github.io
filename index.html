          <p>Microsoft has suspended specific cloud and AI services to Unit 8200, a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, following an investigation into its activities. The decision was prompted by a report from The Guardian alleging the unit used a system to track Palestinians' phone calls, with Microsoft finding evidence supporting the claims. This move comes after internal pressure from employees protesting the use of the company's technology in the Gaza conflict. Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, confirmed the suspension in an internal email, stating the company disabled cloud storage and AI subscriptions being used by the Israeli agency.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is facing renewed scrutiny for not returning $32,000 in donations received from the late financier Jeffrey Epstein in the mid-1990s. While other Democratic figures and groups have since returned or donated equivalent amounts from Epstein, the DNC has defended its decision, citing the age of the contributions. This issue has resurfaced as the DNC actively criticizes the Trump administration's connections to Epstein. The situation highlights the ongoing political complexities and ethical questions surrounding campaign donations from controversial figures, affecting both major political parties in the United States.</p>

          <p>A branch of the National Archives improperly released a largely unredacted version of Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military file to a political opponent, potentially violating federal privacy laws. The disclosed documents contained sensitive personal information, including her Social Security number, home addresses, and performance evaluations. The National Personnel Records Center acknowledged the error, stating a technician failed to follow standard procedures, and has since apologized to the congresswoman. The breach occurred amid a competitive New Jersey governor's race, with opponents examining Sherrill's record for information related to a 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal, in which she was not implicated.</p>

The agreement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and allocates $1.5 billion for refunds to approximately 35 million affected consumers. As part of the settlement, Amazon, which did not admit wrongdoing, is required to make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent and straightforward for users. This penalty is one of the largest ever imposed by the FTC, though Amazon still faces a broader antitrust lawsuit from the agency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Career federal prosecutors in Virginia concluded a two-month investigation by recommending against bringing criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. According to sources, a detailed memo outlined that there was insufficient evidence to secure an indictment, let alone a conviction. Despite this recommendation, the newly appointed U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury, aligning with President Trump's directive to prosecute political adversaries.

          <p>With a federal government shutdown deadline just days away, congressional Democrats are holding firm on their demand that any short-term funding bill must include protections for key health-care programs. Specifically, they are pushing for an extension of the enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, warning that their expiration could cause a significant spike in insurance premiums for millions of Americans. President Trump has backed out of negotiations, canceling a meeting with Democratic leaders and escalating the risk of a shutdown. Republicans are advocating for a "clean" stopgap bill without policy additions, creating a high-stakes impasse on Capitol Hill.</p>

Under the new regulations, workers aged 50 and older who earn more than $145,000 must make their catch-up contributions to a Roth account using after-tax dollars. This change eliminates the immediate tax deduction for these contributions, shifting the tax burden to their higher-earning years rather than retirement.

          <p>The UK's Department for Education (DfE) has proposed a plan to increase the fees private schools in England pay for inspections conducted by the regulator Ofsted. Currently, taxpayer funds cover a significant portion of the £6.5 million annual cost, with schools contributing only £2.2 million. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson argued that taxpayers should not subsidize private businesses and that the additional revenue would be redirected to improve state schools. The proposal, now under consultation, would gradually raise the annual fees over the next five years for the approximately 1,150 independent schools, many of which are special schools, inspected by Ofsted.</p>

The report highlights multiple breakdowns, including a lack of a unified communication platform and concerns about "over-warning," but stops short of assigning direct blame to any single agency or individual.

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is encountering resistance from fellow Labour Party MPs regarding his potential ambitions to challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. While Burnham claims some MPs have encouraged him to stand, many others have publicly and privately dismissed the idea as self-indulgent and damaging to the party so soon after a general election. Critics are urging him to focus on his role as mayor, with one minister labeling his comments "completely illogical." This internal friction highlights growing anxieties within the Labour Party about its direction and leadership ahead of next year's elections.</p>

          <p>New York City police are searching for an individual who allegedly pepper-sprayed a 60-year-old on-duty MTA bus driver in the face. The assault occurred on August 23 in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens after the suspect reportedly became irate. The bus driver was operating the Q6 bus at the time of the incident and received treatment at the scene for pain and irritation but was not seriously injured. Authorities have released a description of the suspect, who was last seen wearing a multicolored tank top and white pants, and are asking the public for assistance.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Wall Street Journal details the chaotic and disorganized response within the Trump administration to the Jeffrey Epstein files saga. Tensions reportedly flared after the Justice Department released a memo effectively closing the case, an event described as being "like a bomb went off" in the White House. The article claims President Trump was worried friends might be named in the files and that he personally called Rupert Murdoch to try to stop a story about a letter he allegedly sent Epstein. The administration's handling of the issue has been characterized by high-stakes strategy meetings, finger-pointing, and a series of unforced errors.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), with defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million in a Ponzi-like scheme. REV acquired the brand names of several bankrupt retailers, including RadioShack and Pier 1 Imports, with the promise of turning them into profitable online businesses. The SEC alleges that between 2020 and 2022, the founders made material misrepresentations to investors, falsely claiming the companies were highly profitable. Instead, they allegedly used money from new investors to pay returns to earlier ones and misappropriated at least $16 million for personal use.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has initiated a "phased restart" of its operations after a cyber-attack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. The company reports that some financial and parts logistics systems are back online, allowing it to process payments to suppliers and sell registered vehicles. However, its manufacturing plants remain closed until at least next month, and the UK government is considering financial support for JLR's suppliers, many of whom face potential collapse due to the prolonged shutdown. The attack has caused massive disruption for the carmaker, which typically builds 1,000 cars per day.</p>

The company cited a "challenging" market, with overall vehicle sales declining by 4.1% and net income falling by approximately 28% compared to the same period last year. CEO Bill Nash attributed the poor performance to shifting market conditions and depreciation in the company's inventory. The significant stock drop sent CarMax shares to their lowest price since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020, raising concerns across the auto retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The solid economic performance provides evidence of resilience despite headwinds from trade wars and a slowing job market. This stronger-than-expected GDP data may influence the Federal Reserve, potentially reducing the likelihood of additional interest rate cuts later in the year as the economy appears to be on a solid footing.

          <p>A new report from UC Berkeley reveals that the climate crisis is exacerbating California's high cost of living by imposing significant "hidden costs" on households. These costs manifest as rising utility bills, lost wages for outdoor workers, increased healthcare expenses from events like wildfires, and skyrocketing insurance premiums. The analysis estimates that an average American born in 2024 could face up to $500,000 in additional lifetime costs due to climate change. The report synthesizes over 100 sources to argue that addressing the state's affordability crisis is intrinsically linked to implementing effective climate solutions.</p>

While infestations can cause significant itching, they are not a health hazard and do not transmit disease. Treatment options range from over-the-counter medications to professional removal services, and experts stress that children do not need to be kept out of school once treatment has begun.</p>
