        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's first-quarter earnings report revealed a 20% drop in automotive revenue compared to the previous year, falling short of Wall Street estimates. The company attributes this decline to factory line updates for the refreshed Model Y and lower average selling prices. Net income also experienced a significant decrease of 71%. Tesla cautioned investors about increasing uncertainty in automotive and energy markets due to rapidly evolving trade policies, including tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, which are impacting the global supply chain and potentially reducing demand.

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared divided over whether a Maryland school board should allow parents to opt their children out of instruction involving storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The case centers on whether schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. Conservative justices seemed inclined to side with families arguing the instruction violates their religious beliefs. The school board argued that opt-outs had become unworkable, but the justices questioned why accommodations couldn't be made, similar to other areas of instruction.</p>

The ruling stated that voluntary departure deadlines falling on weekends or legal holidays should be extended to the next business day.

          <h2>The Rise of Lawsuit Influencers: Why People Watch Others Read Legal Documents</h2>

          <p>A new trend has emerged on social media: content creators reading and analyzing legal documents for their audiences. These "lawsuit influencers" provide detailed commentary on celebrity lawsuits and other legal disputes, attracting large followings. The popularity of this content stems from a desire for transparency and a distrust of traditional media. Viewers appreciate the detailed analysis and the opportunity to form their own opinions based on the raw information presented in the legal filings. However, the trend has also been associated with online vitriol and misogyny, particularly in cases involving female celebrities.</p>

          <h2>Student Loan Collections Could Hurt Economy, Experts Warn</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are cautioning that the Trump administration's decision to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the economy. The resumption of collections, paused during the COVID-19 pandemic, will lead to wage garnishments for some borrowers, reducing their spending power. This could contribute to an economic slowdown, especially given existing concerns about inflation and growth. While the policy will increase government revenue, it also poses risks to borrowers' credit scores and their ability to make major purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Housing construction in Los Angeles experienced a sharp decline in the first quarter of 2025, potentially worsening the city's affordability crisis. Developers pulled permits for significantly fewer new homes compared to the same period last year.

Economists warn that a sustained pullback in housing development could lead to higher home prices and rents, while also impacting the city's tax revenue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed significant cuts to the State Department, including eliminating the Office of Global Criminal Justice. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the restructure aims to remove offices "misaligned with America's core national interests". The proposal would eliminate numerous domestic offices and jobs, and is said to echo the administration's goal of reducing government spending. Critics have condemned the cuts, while supporters say the move will cut out “radical ideologues” and “bureaucratic infighters”.</p>

          <p>Former Congressman George Santos maintains he has “accepted full responsibility” for his crimes despite social media activity suggesting otherwise. Prosecutors are seeking a prison term of over seven years. Santos' letter to the judge acknowledges remorse but challenges the severity of the recommended sentence.

Milei's recent bold move was ending currency controls, which had restricted access to US dollars for over two decades. While the Argentinian peso has stabilized against the US dollar as inflation slowed, economists caution that the government is using the exchange rate as a "kind of crutch" to suppress inflation.
