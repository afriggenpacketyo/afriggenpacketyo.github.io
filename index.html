          <p>The U.S. Senate confirmed former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., a powerful role overseeing federal and local prosecutions in the city. Her confirmation follows a contentious period where President Trump's previous nominee failed to gain sufficient support. Separately, President Trump publicly rejected a potential deal with Democrats that aimed to advance a block of his nominees in exchange for policy concessions. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the president for abandoning the negotiations, highlighting the ongoing political gridlock as the Senate prepares for its recess.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal watchdog agency, has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith. The probe stems from a complaint filed by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith violated the Hatch Act by engaging in politically motivated prosecutorial activities intended to harm Donald Trump's 2024 election prospects. The Hatch Act restricts federal employees from participating in certain political activities. Smith had previously maintained that his investigations into Trump were not driven by political considerations.</p>

          <p>Over 30 years after the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, leaving a lasting scar on the community and the victims' families. The 1991 crime involved the girls being tied up, shot, and the shop set ablaze, destroying evidence. While four men were arrested and two were convicted years later, their convictions were overturned due to constitutional issues and new DNA evidence that did not match any of the suspects. Investigators and families hold out hope that advancements in DNA technology will eventually identify the killer from a small sample found at the scene.</p>

By precisely adjusting signal waveforms, the drones can cancel out interference at specific locations, offering a significant tactical advantage. This targeted approach represents an evolution from traditional brute-force jamming, which often disrupts both allied and adversary signals indiscriminately.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is facing an uncertain timeline for his return to practice due to a persistent back issue that has sidelined him during training camp. Coach Sean McVay stated that Stafford is considered "week to week" and will not participate in the upcoming joint practice with the Dallas Cowboys. While McVay noted that Stafford is making progress after consulting with a specialist, his absence is a significant concern for the team's offense. In his place, veteran Jimmy Garoppolo is taking first-team repetitions as the Rams prepare for their season opener.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee man faces multiple charges, including 11 counts of attempted first-degree murder, after allegedly trying to detonate improvised explosive devices (IEDs) while being arrested. Police were executing a warrant at the home of Kevin Wade O'Neal for threatening public officials when they discovered a smouldering device. A subsequent search by a bomb squad uncovered a total of 14 IEDs inside the residence. None of the devices ultimately detonated, and O'Neal was taken into custody without harming the nine officers and two other individuals present at the scene.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million, despite his recent good form. The potential sale is linked to the club's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko, whose arrival would marginalize Hojlund's role on the team. While Hojlund has publicly stated his desire to remain at United, the club may need to sell players to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability regulations. Selling Hojlund for £30m would represent a book loss for the club, given he is only two years into his five-year contract.</p>

          <p>World-record-holding hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone demonstrated her remarkable versatility by winning the 400-meter flat race at the U.S. track and field trials. Her victory, achieved with a season's best time of 48.90 seconds, secures her a spot in the event at the upcoming World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. Despite running in her weaker event, she dominated the race and finished just two-tenths of a second shy of the American record. The win highlights her exceptional talent as she continues to explore her capabilities beyond the 400-meter hurdles, where she is the reigning Olympic champion.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus sent to Winston Churchill as a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, died just days before reaching England, with popular legend blaming the trauma of a nearby Nazi U-boat encounter. However, new research from archives at the Australian Museum reveals a more mundane cause of death. Analysis of the ship attendant's logbook showed that the water and air temperatures during the voyage across the equator far exceeded the safe threshold for the species, suggesting the creature likely died from heat stress and inadequate care.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly turning to the development of major theme parks, such as the world's largest Legoland resort, as a strategy to boost consumer spending and drive local economic growth. The theme park industry in China is projected to grow at a 19 percent annual rate over the next three years, with over 4,400 attractions already operating nationwide. According to the global industry association IAAPA, every yuan of revenue generated by these parks has a ripple effect, contributing nearly four times that amount to the local economy. This highlights the government's focus on stimulating domestic consumption through large-scale entertainment and tourism projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lebanon is mourning the death of Ziad Rahbani, one of its most revered and influential artists, who passed away at age 69. A musician, composer, and playwright, Rahbani was known for his unique blend of jazz and traditional Arab music, as well as his sharp social and political commentary. Born to the famed singer Fairuz and composer Assi Rahbani, he carved his own path, creating works that challenged the status quo and resonated deeply with ordinary people, especially during the country's civil war. His collaborations with his mother, Fairuz, are also remembered for transforming her iconic image and bringing a new, more human dimension to her music.</p>

          <p>Kori Schake, a foreign and defense policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argues that President Trump's foreign policy is dangerously isolating the United States. In a recent analysis, she contends that the administration's belief that allies are a burden and its use of arbitrary tariffs are causing other countries to hedge against American power. Schake warns that this approach undermines the cooperative international order that has long benefited U.S. interests. She suggests that sustaining this order is far less costly than a go-it-alone approach, which could force the U.S. to act without the critical support of its allies.</p>

          <p>NPR's media correspondent, David Folkenflik, discusses the unique challenges of covering the media industry, especially when his own network is in the news. He explains that news organizations can be highly controlling and sensitive, but his overriding principle is to report on NPR with the same rigor as any other major outlet. Folkenflik details the formal protocols and "firewall" in place at NPR that allow him to work independently, ensuring his reporting is not influenced by corporate or news executives. At a time of intense scrutiny and political pressure on the press, he emphasizes the importance of living the network's values by reporting the facts fairly, even when it's uncomfortable.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," author Carol Mason argues that the anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with insurrectionary politics and far-right extremism. Mason traces the evolution of rhetoric from "overturn Roe" to "ignore Roe," suggesting a growing disregard for the rule of law that she sees as a precursor to events like the January 6th Capitol attack. The book explores how themes of "standing in the gap" against perceived enemies and conspiracy theories about a "deep state" have created a bridge between anti-abortion activism and white nationalist ideologies, which are converging around shared absolutist goals.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement is ongoing in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, the suspect accused of killing four people in a bar. The shooting occurred Friday morning at The Owl Bar in the small town of Anaconda, where Brown allegedly opened fire on a bartender and three patrons before fleeing. Authorities have located the suspect's vehicle but are now focusing their search in the mountainous terrain west of the town. Brown, a U.S. Army veteran who lived next to the bar, is considered armed and dangerous, and the community remains on high alert.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise or promote illegal small boat crossings over the English Channel. The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could result in up to five years in prison for those creating online material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. This includes social media posts advertising fake documents or promising illegal work. Home Office analysis indicates that a vast majority of migrants arriving by boat have used social media to contact people-smuggling gangs, and the new offense aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt these criminal networks.</p>
