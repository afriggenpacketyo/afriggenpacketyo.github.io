          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman as its nominee for NASA administrator, a decision that surprised many in the space industry. President Trump stated he would announce a new candidate soon, emphasizing a focus on aligning with the mission and prioritizing America in space. Isaacman, a billionaire private astronaut and ally of Elon Musk, expressed gratitude for the support he received during the nomination process. The decision came shortly after Musk's departure from his advisory role in the White House, with potential replacements including retired US air force Lt Gen Steven Kwast. The removal introduces uncertainty for NASA, especially given proposed budget cuts and the need for a confirmed leader.</p>

          <p>China's box office is experiencing a subdued Dragon Boat Festival holiday, with revenue lower than previous holidays, as the industry grapples with underwhelming performances. Despite a Hollywood film, "Mission: Impossible â€“ The Final Reckoning," leading ticket presales, the overall box office revenue for the first day of the holiday was estimated at 122 million yuan, lower than the May 1 holiday. This comes as China's economy struggles to stimulate domestic consumption, leading to a decline in box office revenue last year. However, observers remain optimistic about the long-term resilience of China's film market due to improved domestic productions.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported 250 million bees had escaped, but later corrected the number. The public was advised to avoid the area, and local beekeepers assisted in the effort to re-hive the bees and locate the queen bee. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the recovery operation, and most bees are expected to return to their hives by morning.</p>

Other states and countries are offering more generous tax incentives, attracting productions away from California. Governor Newsom is proposing to more than double the state's film and TV tax credits, but some industry experts are unsure if it will be enough to offset the high cost of working in California.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that the UK government faces unavoidable tough choices as it finalizes spending plans, with the level of health spending dictating potential cuts to unprotected areas like transport and schools. While funding increased sharply in 2024, it will no longer increase year on year, given the government's commitments. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance on ruling out borrowing more money and not raising taxes again has led to speculation spending cuts will be made. The IFS suggests a huge amount depends on the generosity of cash handed to the NHS and defence, potentially pulling funding from other areas.</p>
