Diller emphasizes that too much information can hinder decision-making, particularly in creative and business contexts. He recalls his time at ABC, where he championed the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week," and highlights successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" that were driven by instinct. The book also reveals the sexuality that he kept secret from an early age. Data is often harmful to instinct, and I believe this to be true for making not only creative decisions but many business decisions.</p>

The clashes involved airstrikes, antiaircraft volleys, and weaponized drones, marking a shift towards noncontact warfare.
