          <p>Amazon will pay a landmark $2.5 billion to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that it deceived millions of consumers into signing up for its Prime subscription service and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The agreement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion designated for customer refunds, resolving the case just days after the trial began. While Amazon admitted no wrongdoing, the settlement mandates clearer disclosures about Prime's terms and a simplified cancellation method for users. This case represents a significant victory for the FTC in its ongoing regulatory scrutiny of the tech giant's business practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma wildlife preserve owner, who was an associate of Joseph Maldonado-Passage, also known as "Joe Exotic," was killed by a tiger during a performance. The 37-year-old owner of Growler Pines Tiger Preserve was bitten on the neck and shoulder by a tiger he had raised since it was a cub, according to the local sheriff. The incident occurred in front of an audience near the end of a show. Animal rights organization PETA responded by condemning the practice of keeping big cats in captivity for entertainment and called for remaining exhibitors to send their animals to accredited sanctuaries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is days away from a potential shutdown as congressional Democrats and the White House remain at an impasse over short-term funding legislation. Democrats are demanding that any stopgap bill must include protections for health care programs, specifically the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are set to expire. Republicans are pushing for a "clean" funding bill without these policy additions, creating a stalemate with a Wednesday deadline approaching.

          <p>A sniper opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, resulting in the death of one detainee and critically injuring two others. The suspect, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, allegedly left a handwritten note expressing a desire to inflict "real terror" on ICE agents. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, noting that recovered bullets had anti-ICE messages engraved on them. The attack has prompted heightened security at ICE facilities nationwide amid what officials describe as a significant increase in assaults against its officers.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to announce government plans to develop a compulsory, nationwide digital ID scheme. The proposal aims to modernize state services and strengthen measures against illegal employment by providing a more consistent and secure method for verifying identity. The government will launch a consultation to determine the practical implementation of the system, including how to ensure accessibility for individuals without smartphones or passports. This move revisits a concept previously blocked under a prior administration, with proponents suggesting the public has grown more accustomed to digital forms of identification.</p>

The strategy, led by CEO Brian Niccol, who joined the company a year ago, seeks to reverse a trend of declining sales over six consecutive quarters.

          <p>An independent report on the deadly Eaton fire in Los Angeles County has identified significant breakdowns in communication and coordination that prevented timely evacuation orders for the west Altadena community. The investigation found that despite numerous 911 calls reporting flames, critical alerts were delayed for hours, with no evacuation orders sent between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. on the night of the fire. The report highlights a lack of a unified communication platform between the fire department, sheriff's department, and emergency management, which exacerbated delays. Nineteen people died in the fire, with all but one found in the area where alerts were botched.</p>

          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has ruled that the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance breached the corporation's guidelines on harm and offence. The ruling cited the band leading a chant of "death, death to the IDF" and using abusive and offensive language directed at a record company executive and referring to "Zionists." However, the complaints unit cleared the performance of breaching rules on impartiality and incitement to crime, stating that calls for a free Palestine and chants against an institution do not inherently threaten violent action.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to 6.13%, their lowest level since early 2022. For a new $400,000 mortgage, this translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,432 per month, excluding taxes and insurance. This represents a monthly saving of about $240 compared to rates seen in January 2025, when the same loan would have cost around $2,672 per month. The lower rate environment provides significant relief for potential homebuyers and also creates attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments.

Critics within the party are urging Burnham to concentrate on his mayoral duties rather than speculating on national leadership.

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered in Spain two decades ago has finally been identified through an international cold case initiative by Interpol. Known as "the woman in pink" for the clothes she was wearing, she has been identified as Liudmila Zavada, a 31-year-old Russian national. The breakthrough came after police in Turkey matched her fingerprints to their national database as part of Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign. A DNA sample from a close relative confirmed the identification, bringing a name to a victim in a suspicious death case that had remained unsolved since 2005.</p>

          <p>Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's state superintendent of public instruction, is resigning from his post to lead a conservative education non-profit called the Teacher Freedom Alliance. Walters gained national notoriety for his efforts to integrate right-wing and religious viewpoints into public schools, including attempts to place Trump-branded Bibles in classrooms and mandate teaching on 2020 election conspiracies. In his new role, he plans to build a national movement to, in his words, "destroy the teachers unions." His tenure was marked by frequent national media appearances as he pursued a Christian nationalist agenda for education.</p>

          <p>Shares of used-vehicle retailer CarMax plummeted by over 20% after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company cited a "challenging" market, with overall vehicle sales declining 4.1% compared to the same period last year, contributing to a 28% drop in net income. CEO Bill Nash attributed the poor performance to shifting market conditions and depreciation in the company's vehicle inventory. The disappointing results from CarMax, often seen as a bellwether for the auto retail sector, also led to a drop in the stock prices of other car retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy's growth in the second quarter was revised up to a strong 3.8% annualized rate, according to the Commerce Department's final estimate. This figure is higher than the previous estimate of 3.3% and marks a significant rebound from the 0.6% contraction in the first quarter. The upward revision was largely driven by stronger-than-expected consumer spending, which rose at a 2.5% pace, indicating robust consumer health despite broader economic headwinds. The solid economic performance could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding further interest rate cuts for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that the climate crisis is imposing significant "hidden costs" on California households, worsening the state's existing affordability issues. These costs manifest as higher utility bills, increased healthcare expenses from events like wildfire smoke exposure, and lost wages for workers in affected industries such as agriculture. The analysis estimates that an American born in 2024 could face up to $500,000 in additional lifetime costs due to climate change. The report compiles over 100 sources to argue that the financial impacts of climate change are immediate and tangible, not just a future problem.</p>

          <p>Russia is facing significant economic strain from its war in Ukraine, prompting the Kremlin to plan tax hikes and spending cuts to address a growing budget deficit. The government announced plans to raise the value-added tax from 20% to 22% and is expected to reduce non-defense spending, including social programs. These measures are driven by a sharp decline in oil and gas revenues, a key source of state income, which have been impacted by falling prices and sanctions. Analysts suggest these mounting economic woes are creating domestic pressure that could influence President Putin's long-term strategy for the conflict.</p>

Watson, who previously spoke out against Rowling's views, emphasized that she could not "cancel her out" and that she treasures the author for the kindness and opportunities she provided. However, following the interview, Rowling posted a message on social media that appeared to be a rebuff, addressing those who may be "regretting their very public sprint to the front of the mob."

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. were largely unchanged in August, registering a slight 0.2% decrease from July, according to the National Association of Realtors. The data reflects deals signed when mortgage rates were higher, before a drop in early September. A key factor constraining the market is a lack of inventory, as the supply of homes for sale fell for the first time since the start of the year, keeping prices elevated. The median home price rose 2% year-over-year, marking the 26th consecutive month of annual gains, with sales strongest in the more affordable Midwest region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In recent remarks, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that by many measures, U.S. stock prices are "fairly highly valued." This statement suggests that the central bank perceives equities as potentially overvalued relative to their underlying fundamentals, such as corporate earnings. One common metric, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, shows the S&P 500 trading at a significant premium compared to its 20-year average, indicating stocks are historically expensive. Powell's comments reflect the Fed's monitoring of overall financial conditions as it formulates monetary policy, though he did not signal any immediate policy changes based on market valuations.
