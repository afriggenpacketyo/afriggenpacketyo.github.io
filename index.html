          <p>An excerpt from Arundhati Roy's first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," has been released ahead of its September publication. The Booker Prize-winning author of "The God of Small Things" delves into her complex and formative relationship with her mother. The previewed section, titled "Gangster," reflects on her mother's recent death, the arrangements for her unconventional funeral, and the decades-long, often tumultuous conversations they had about mortality and inheritance. Roy explores the profound, almost physical pain of losing a parent so deeply intertwined with the landscape of her home in Kerala, India.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, which is scheduled to be eliminated after September 30. According to the IRS, a buyer who enters into a "written binding contract" and makes a payment by the deadline is entitled to the credit, even if they take physical possession of the vehicle at a later date. This provides crucial flexibility for those unable to drive their new EV off the lot before the cutoff. The clarification applies to new, used, and leased electric vehicles, offering continued access to the significant federal incentive.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from Vox explores a hypothetical second Trump administration's approach to COVID-19 vaccines, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. The piece suggests such an administration would dismantle the achievements of Operation Warp Speed by casting doubt on vaccine safety and efficacy. Actions discussed include canceling grants for new mRNA vaccine development, replacing scientific advisory committees with vaccine skeptics, and restricting public access to COVID-19 shots. This represents a significant reversal from Trump's first term, where he championed the rapid development of the vaccines as a "medical miracle."</p>

          <p>Despite public awareness campaigns and warnings, India continues to lead the world in deaths and injuries related to taking dangerous selfies, often referred to as "killfies." Recent surveys show India accounts for nearly half of all such incidents globally, with common danger zones being heights like cliffs and waterfalls, as well as encounters with wildlife. Research indicates that men are involved in roughly three-quarters of these fatal incidents, driven by a desire for online validation and social media fame.

          <p>During the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping engaged in several key diplomatic meetings, including with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In their first meeting in seven years, both leaders committed to improving bilateral ties, with Xi stating they should be partners, not rivals. Xi also met with leaders from Azerbaijan and Armenia, discussing strategic partnerships, economic cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative, and supporting their potential inclusion in the SCO. These discussions highlight Beijing's efforts to strengthen regional cooperation as an alternative to Western-led global structures amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced a significant shift in the party's climate policy, pledging to remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea if elected. The plan aims to "maximise extraction" of fossil fuels, arguing it is "absurd" to leave resources untapped while other nations extract them. This move reverses the UK's legally binding commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, a target established by a previous Conservative government. The current Labour government criticized the proposal, stating it would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills or improving energy security.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the country this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns. This tragic event highlights a broader issue of declining vaccine uptake in the UK, with health officials noting that none of the primary childhood vaccines met the 95% coverage target last year. Officials are urging pregnant women and parents of young children to adhere to vaccination schedules to prevent further severe cases of this dangerous respiratory infection.</p>

          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity for matcha, driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, is causing significant supply shortages and price increases. Japanese tea producers are struggling to keep up with demand, as the labor-intensive process of growing tencha—the tea used for matcha—creates a production bottleneck. Prices for tencha have skyrocketed, with some retailers reporting that the cost of matcha has doubled in the past year. In response, shops are implementing purchase limits, and major companies like Ito En are creating dedicated divisions to secure supply chains and manage rising costs.</p>

While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, persistent absenteeism remains higher than pre-COVID levels. Phillipson stressed that missing even a few days early on can negatively impact a child's long-term educational success and life chances.</p>

The move, part of a national directive from the Trump administration, has been condemned by local officials as a politically motivated attack, particularly on the LGBTQ+ community. Several cities, including Fort Lauderdale and Key West, are vowing to fight the order, setting up a legal battle over local control and freedom of expression.

Environmental groups advocate for using more sustainable refrigerants and for consumers to choose energy-efficient models.

          <p>This article examines whether the Trump administration's actions have normalized autocratic tendencies within American politics, drawing parallels to patterns seen in other countries. It cites examples such as fawning praise from cabinet members, the criminalization of political opponents, calls for the arrest of critics, and the use of federal agencies for political purposes. Observers and activists, including those who have fled authoritarian regimes, express a grim recognition of these patterns. The piece explores the debate over whether this represents a new threat or an acceleration of pre-existing flaws in American democracy, and whether the trend can be reversed.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Halts $679 Million in Federal Funding for Offshore Wind Port Projects</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for 12 port projects intended to support the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry. The move is the latest in the president's campaign against wind power, which he has criticized as expensive and harmful to wildlife. The canceled funds were meant to develop crucial infrastructure for assembling and deploying massive offshore turbines, an industry that was poised for significant growth. Port officials and clean energy advocates condemned the decision, arguing it will kill thousands of jobs and hinder the country's transition to renewable energy sources.</p>

          <p>British Transport Police are investigating two stabbings that occurred at the Oxford Circus tube station in central London within a 24-hour period over the weekend. The attacks, which police believe are connected, resulted in a 23-year-old man and a 41-year-old man being hospitalized with injuries that are not considered life-threatening. Authorities have released an image of a man they wish to speak with in connection to the incidents and have increased their presence at the station. No arrests have been made, and police are appealing to the public for any information that could assist their investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the complex undersea topography of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea could be exploited to create a "submarine kill zone." The research highlights how rugged seamounts create "acoustic shadow zones" where sonar is ineffective, making them ideal locations for deploying intelligent sea mines. By placing underwater weapons in these sonar dead zones, the study claims China could enhance the concealment of its assets and selectively target enemy vessels. This strategy could potentially challenge U.S. naval dominance in undersea warfare in the contested region.</p>

          <p>As investors return from summer holidays, market analysis indicates a cautious outlook for September, which has historically been the most challenging month for major stock indices like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq. Despite record highs for the S&P 500 and Dow at the end of August, historical data suggests a seasonal downturn is common. While some analysts believe the bull market will continue due to a potential economic soft landing and solid earnings, others are more wary, pointing to underlying pressures on the U.S. economy. Key economic data releases, including inflation and non-farm payrolls, will be closely watched. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has spoken about her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad, calling it the best she has ever made for her mental and physical well-being. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea win a domestic treble, Bright realized she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give her best for the national team. The 32-year-old, who has since had knee surgery and started counseling, emphasized the immense pressure of her leadership roles and the importance of prioritizing her own health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that the UK's Reform party is importing Donald Trump's antagonistic tactics toward the press, citing a recent decision by the Reform-led Nottinghamshire county council to ban the local newspaper. This move is compared to the Trump administration's practice of restricting access for journalists and news outlets that publish critical coverage. The author suggests that hard-right politicians on both sides of the Atlantic increasingly feel they can shun traditional media without electoral consequences, instead using the press as a foil in a broader anti-establishment narrative. This trend poses a significant challenge to local democracy and government accountability.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins football team began its season with a disappointing 43-10 blowout loss to Utah at the Rose Bowl. After a training camp where coach DeShaun Foster tightly controlled media access, the team's struggles were on full display. The defense was unable to contain Utah's offense, giving up 492 yards and consistently failing to stop third-down conversions. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava and the running game struggled to find a consistent rhythm against the Utes' defense. The lopsided defeat marks a significant step back for the program after a strong finish to the previous season.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the tenth anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which signaled the country's open-door policy to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, and its consequences are still debated today. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave are now employed, challenges with integration and unemployment persist. The anniversary has prompted a national stock-taking of the successes and failures of the integration efforts over the past decade.</p>

The arrests were for offenses including assault on a police officer and violent disorder. This was part of a series of similar demonstrations and counter-demonstrations that took place across England and Scotland over the weekend, reflecting heightened tensions surrounding the UK's asylum policies.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to protect livestock, biologists with the USDA are using drones to haze gray wolves away from cattle ranches near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast a variety of sounds, including the AC/DC song "Thunderstruck," clips from the film "Marriage Story," and live human voices. This nonlethal method is part of an ongoing experiment to find creative ways to manage the increasing conflict between ranchers and the recovering wolf population. While the technology is expensive, early results have shown success in interrupting wolf hunts and promoting coexistence.</p>
