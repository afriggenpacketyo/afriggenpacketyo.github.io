          <p>A 45-year-old Iraqi man, Akeel Abdul Jamiel, has been charged with illegally voting in the 2020 presidential election. Federal officials credited Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with assisting in the investigation. Jamiel, residing in South Glens Falls, N.Y., was allegedly ineligible to vote due to his non-citizen status but registered as a member of the Conservative Party shortly before the election. This case marks the first publicly announced instance where DOGE's involvement led to charges related to election integrity, as the unit works to identify and prevent voter fraud.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab has shown potential in eliminating tumors in some patients with early-stage cancers, potentially allowing them to avoid surgery. In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer required an operation, with a significant number of rectal cancer patients achieving complete remission. The study focused on patients with tumors having a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic condition making them more responsive to immunotherapy, but researchers are optimistic about expanding the therapy's application to other cancer types. Further research is underway to replicate these results in broader patient populations and establish dostarlimab as a standard of care.</p>

          <p>Canada held a pivotal election as voters weighed the leadership best suited to navigate economic challenges and U.S. President Trump's policies. Trump's threats of annexation and tariffs have loomed large, influencing voter decisions alongside domestic issues like affordability and immigration. Both Liberal leader Mark Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre have addressed Trump's influence, with voters expressing concerns about Canadian sovereignty and economic partnerships. Trump further stirred the election with a Truth Social post suggesting Canada become the 51st U.S. state, prompting Poilievre to assert Canada's independence.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is calling for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms, aiming to alleviate critical staffing shortages in the field. Currently, breast screening examinations are exclusively conducted by female staff. The SoR argues that expanding the pool of qualified professionals could improve recruitment and service delivery. While some women have expressed concerns about male radiographers, others believe that life-saving procedures should be accessible regardless of the provider's gender.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has been advocating for President Trump to leverage his position to negotiate lower tariffs for U.S. goods and services, rather than maintaining high retaliatory tariffs. Cruz believes this approach would be a historic victory for American jobs and workers. He warned that imposing high tariffs permanently would be disastrous for states like Texas and the country as a whole. Cruz emphasized that the President has a choice between a positive outcome through negotiation and a potentially harmful path of escalating trade barriers.</p>
