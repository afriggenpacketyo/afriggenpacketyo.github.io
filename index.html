          <p>A helicopter crashed in Huntington Beach, Southern California, on Saturday afternoon, resulting in five people being hospitalized, including a child. The incident occurred near a parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway, with dramatic video showing the helicopter spinning before impacting palm trees and a pedestrian bridge. Two individuals on board, identified as the pilot and passenger, were safely rescued and hospitalized, with the pilot reportedly sustaining broken ribs and a fractured spine. Three pedestrians on the street were also injured, and all five were taken for treatment, though their conditions were not immediately known. Authorities, including the FAA and NTSB, are investigating the cause, with a report anticipated within 30 days. The wreckage was cleared and the area reopened, but the pedestrian bridge remains closed for necessary repairs.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Falcons secured a 24-14 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football, advancing their season record to 3-2. Running back Bijan Robinson delivered a standout performance, rushing for 170 yards on 19 carries, highlighted by an 81-yard touchdown that significantly widened the lead. Wide receiver Drake London also contributed substantially, recording 158 yards on 10 catches, including a nine-yard touchdown. The Falcons' defense was instrumental, sacking Bills quarterback Josh Allen four times and preventing significant rushing gains, marking a rare uncharacteristic offensive showing for Buffalo. This win ends the Bills' four-game winning streak and solidifies Atlanta's strong position in the league.</p>

          <p>Shanghai-listed shares of Chinese chipmaker Wingtech plunged 10% for a second consecutive session after the Dutch government took control of its Netherlands-based subsidiary, Nexperia. The Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs stated the decision, made under the "Goods Availability Act," was to prevent Nexperia's vital chip products from becoming unavailable in an emergency, as they are crucial for automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial supply chains in Europe. This action highlights escalating global tensions over critical technology supply chains and national security concerns, impacting Wingtech directly. The broader Asian markets saw mixed performance, with South Korea's Kospi hitting an all-time high, while Japan's Nikkei declined. U.S. equity futures were little changed, recovering some losses after President Trump softened his stance on China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small plane crashed onto Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, on Monday morning, killing a husband and wife from Middletown, Rhode Island. The fixed-wing, single-engine plane's fuselage landed on the grassy median and erupted in flames, with other parts scattered in nearby woods. A woman driving on the highway sustained non-life-threatening injuries after being impacted by a portion of the crashed aircraft. The victims, 68-year-old Thomas Perkins and his 66-year-old wife Agatha, were well-known in their community for their construction business and charitable contributions. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, and it remains unclear if the ongoing nor'easter, bringing heavy rain and strong winds, was a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>Carrie Elizabeth Romney, the 64-year-old sister-in-law of former Utah Senator Mitt Romney, was found dead near a Santa Clarita shopping mall on Friday evening. Her cause of death remains under investigation, with authorities currently speculating she may have fallen or jumped from a five-story parking structure. Homicide investigators responded to the scene, and the L.A. County medical examiner has listed her cause of death as deferred, indicating that further tests, such as toxicology, are needed and could take months to complete. This tragic incident has drawn attention due to her connection to the prominent political figure, as Mitt Romney recently concluded his term as a U.S. Senator from Utah.</p>

Manufacturing, particularly in biomedical and general manufacturing, acted as a drag on growth, while construction and financial services are projected to benefit from infrastructure spending and favorable financial conditions.

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free law targeting distracted drivers, making it illegal to hold a cellphone while operating a vehicle, with tickets starting at $150 for a first offense. This law aims to curb accidents, as distracted driving kills approximately nine people daily in the U.S. and injures hundreds of thousands annually. State officials are now utilizing telematics data, gathered anonymously from smartphones and vehicles, to identify distracted driving "hot spots," revealing that the issue is likely closer to one in three fatal crashes, far higher than previously indicated by crash reports. This data-driven approach will help tailor educational programs and law enforcement visibility to areas with higher rates of distracted driving, enhancing public safety across the state.</p>

          <p>Petros Krommidas, a 29-year-old Democratic candidate for local office in New York, disappeared months ago after going for a night swim in the Atlantic Ocean, with his belongings found on the beach. Despite his presumed fate, a state judge ruled that his name must remain on the November ballot, as he is still legally considered missing and not officially deceased under state law. This unusual situation presents voters with the choice between the Republican incumbent and a candidate who has vanished, drawing comparisons to similar past cases in U.S. political history. Supporters hope a victory for Krommidas would trigger a special election, allowing Democrats to field a replacement candidate, highlighting the complexities of election law in such rare circumstances.</p>

The new law raises wages from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, though still notably below the state minimum wage of $16.50. This measure, which takes effect immediately, allocates $10 million for incarcerated firefighters' wages, acknowledging their crucial and dangerous work in clearing brush and digging containment lines. This legislation addresses a popular social justice cause that has gained traction in recent years, building on a 2020 law that allows nonviolent incarcerated people on fire crews to have their records expunged.</p>

          <p>The Gaza peace plan, brokered by President Trump, advanced significantly with Hamas's release of all 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. These steps followed a ceasefire and partial Israeli troop pullback, but the situation remains fragile with major unresolved questions. Future negotiations must address complex issues like Gaza's postwar governance, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm, which the group has rejected, and Palestinian demands for a state, which the current Israeli government has opposed. An international body is envisioned to govern Gaza, overseeing technocrats and a new Palestinian security force, highlighting the many hurdles ahead for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation, Assembly Bill 749, to establish a commission tasked with studying inequalities in youth sports, considering factors like race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability. This move is expected to draw criticism from Republicans, who interpret the inclusion of "gender identity" as a veiled attempt to support transgender athletes, a topic Newsom himself has acknowledged as complex and politically challenging. The bill's author, Assemblymember Tina S. McKinnor, emphasized the legislation's potential racial impact, citing significant disparities in structured sports participation among white, Black, and Latino youth. The commission will examine the need for a new state board or department to improve access to sports for all youth across California.</p>

          <p>The Gaza ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange have become a significant point for student-led protest movements on California university campuses, which have been active for two years. While students expressed relief over the ceasefire, pro-Palestinian activists vowed to continue their demands for university divestment from companies linked to the Israeli government, arguing that the underlying issues remain unresolved. The activism has led to increased allegations of antisemitism and anti-Muslim/anti-Arab incidents, prompting aggressive investigations and disciplinary actions against students and groups.

An elite military unit, CAPSAT, joined the protests and called for his resignation, prompting Rajoelina to denounce an illegal attempt to seize power. He called for dialogue and respect for the constitution, though his speech was broadcast on social media after soldiers attempted to control state media. The unrest, initially over chronic water and electricity outages, has escalated into wider discontent with Rajoelina, who first came to power in a 2009 military-backed coup.

This follows similar partisan moves in Texas and California, which have already approved maps favoring their respective parties, and Missouri's governor ordering a special session for map redrawing.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed caution regarding Monday's market rally, which saw indexes recouping some losses from the previous week, stating it was excessively fueled by speculative stocks. While the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all surged after former President Trump softened his stance on China, Cramer highlighted that many of the biggest winners were volatile, unprofitable companies, particularly in the nuclear power and quantum computing sectors. He referenced his concern about market froth created by enormous gains in such risky names, including Bloom Energy and Rigetti Computing. Cramer's analysis suggests that while the overall market rebound was positive, the leadership from speculative stocks indicates potential instability, warranting a cautious approach from investors.
