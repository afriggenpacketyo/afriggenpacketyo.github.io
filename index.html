          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned numerous generals, admirals, and their respective staffs from around the world to an urgent, rare meeting in Quantico, Virginia, next week. This significant gathering, confirmed by U.S. officials, is highly unusual due to its substantial size and the short notice provided, indicating a critical agenda to be addressed by the Secretary of War. While regular senior military leader meetings are common, an assembly of this magnitude on such short notice is considered unprecedented. The specific details regarding the topics of discussion remain undisclosed, contributing to the heightened attention surrounding this event and signaling potentially pressing global security concerns that require immediate high-level coordination.</p>

          <p>England and Canada have confirmed unchanged teams for the Women's Rugby World Cup final this Saturday at Twickenham, promising a highly anticipated clash between the world's top two sides. England's Red Roses, led by Zoe Aldcroft and boasting a record 32-Test winning streak, seek to reclaim the title they last won in 2014, having lost the previous two finals. Their opponents, Canada, a semi-professional team that partially crowdfunded their World Cup campaign, are making their first final appearance since 2014. The match is poised to be a landmark event for women's rugby, with a sold-out Twickenham expected to host a record-breaking crowd of 82,000.</p>

          <p>E-commerce entrepreneurs Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), are accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of orchestrating a $112 million Ponzi scheme. The SEC alleges that between 2020 and 2022, they defrauded hundreds of investors by making material misrepresentations about the profitability of bankrupt retail brands they acquired, such as RadioShack and Pier 1 Imports. Investors were allegedly told their money would be invested in specific firms, but funds were instead commingled and used to pay earlier investors, a classic Ponzi scheme characteristic. Furthermore, Mehr and Lopez are claimed to have diverted $16 million for personal use, with their COO also facing accusations of aiding these alleged crimes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has commenced a "phased restart" of its operations, with certain IT systems now back online following a cyber attack in August that suspended production. The company is actively working to clear a backlog of payments to suppliers, having increased its invoicing processing capacity, and its global parts logistics center is resuming full operations. However, JLR's manufacturing plants are still closed until at least next month, causing continued disruption across its supply chain. Concerns are growing for small parts suppliers, prompting the government to explore support options to prevent bankruptcies. This article illustrates the significant and far-reaching consequences of cyberattacks on large-scale manufacturing and its intricate ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Interpol has successfully identified "the woman in pink" as Liudmila Zavada, a Russian national, two decades after her body was found by a road in Barcelona, Spain. Her identification was a direct result of Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, launched in 2023 to resolve cold cases of women murdered or found under suspicious circumstances across Europe. Spanish police submitted the case in 2024, leading to a fingerprint match by Turkish authorities and subsequent DNA confirmation from a relative. Zavada was 31 when she died, and her case's resolution provides renewed hope for the 44 other women still awaiting identification through this crucial international initiative.</p>

CarMax CEO Bill Nash described the quarter, ending August 31, as "challenging," attributing the lackluster performance to changing market conditions, earlier "tariff fear-buying" pulling sales forward, and depreciation in its inventory. The company's overall vehicle sales dropped 4.1%, contributing to a 28% decline in net income. Other auto retailers also saw their shares fall, as CarMax's results often serve as an early market indicator. (not investment advice)</p>

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clarifies that head lice spread mainly through direct head-to-head contact, not poor hygiene, and cannot jump, hop, or fly. Prevention involves avoiding sharing personal items and close contact during activities. Symptoms, such as scalp itching, can take up to six weeks to manifest. Various treatments exist, from FDA-approved over-the-counter products to professional services, and experts stress that lice are not a health hazard, urging schools to update policies that unnecessarily exclude affected students.</p>

Plans include raising value-added tax to 22% and reducing non-defense spending, even social programs, to sustain high military expenditures. The budget deficit has reached approximately 1.9% of GDP, significantly surpassing original targets, primarily due to declining oil and gas revenues and the ongoing impact of Western sanctions.

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly adopting an "interventionist policy approach," drawing inspiration from China's industrial playbook, in the escalating economic competition between the two nations. Experts like Brian Wong and Rajiv Biswas observe that Washington's recent actions, especially concerning strategic sectors such as defense technology and advanced electronics, stem from a recognition that commercial market forces alone cannot guarantee sufficient domestic supply capacity for crucial inputs. Heightened geopolitical tensions are a primary driver behind U.S. government anxieties regarding supply chain vulnerabilities for vital components like semiconductors and critical minerals. This policy shift signifies a more assertive governmental role in industrial strategy to bolster national security and economic self-reliance.</p>

          <p>NASA's powerful James Webb Space Telescope has captured breathtaking, unprecedented images of Sagittarius B2, the most active star-forming region within the Milky Way galaxy. This massive molecular cloud, situated just hundreds of light-years from the supermassive black hole at the galactic center, is responsible for producing 50% of the galaxy's stars despite containing only 10% of its gas. The telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument revealed gas and dust with extraordinary detail, while its Near-Infrared Camera showcased vibrant stars illuminating bright cosmic clouds. Astronomers will utilize these new observations to further understand star formation processes and investigate lingering questions, such as the unexpectedly low star formation rate in the galactic center.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Gen Z population has ignited widespread anti-government protests, driven by profound frustration over decades of corruption, political stagnation, and pervasive inequality. The demonstrations, partially sparked by social media showcasing the lavish lifestyles of the elite, escalated into violence when police fired on protesters, resulting in 19 deaths, including Praveen Kulung. His brother, Mausam Kulung, has pledged to continue the struggle for a new future for Nepal. The unrest prompted Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's resignation and the appointment of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki, who promised to combat corruption. With new elections scheduled for March 2026, young Nepalis are now actively exploring the formation of a new political party to usher in democratic change.</p>

Reports also indicate that UEFA, European football's governing body, may convene next week to discuss a potential suspension of Israel. Despite the significant international pressure and ongoing conflict, the U.S. government's position is to ensure Israel's continued participation in global football tournaments.</p>

          <p>Initial claims for U.S. unemployment insurance unexpectedly dropped to 218,000 last week, falling significantly below the 235,000 estimate and alleviating fears of a weakening labor market. This decline of 14,000 from the previous week suggests that companies are still hesitant to part with employees, even amidst a general slowdown in hiring. The positive jobless claims data, alongside a revised 3.8% GDP growth in the second quarter and a rise in durable goods orders, points to a resilient underlying economy. These strong economic indicators could influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, potentially reducing the impetus for additional interest rate cuts later in the year.

While recognizing California Governor Gavin Newsom's presidential qualities, Smith voiced doubts about his national electability, attributing this to California's economic challenges and the exodus of businesses from the state.

Neon, the film's global distributor, unequivocally condemned the "unauthorised edit" and demanded an immediate halt to its distribution. This article underscores China's stringent censorship of LGBTQ+ content and its increasingly sophisticated use of AI-generated alterations, provoking significant backlash from Chinese moviegoers who criticized the distortion and disrespect towards the film's original narrative and an actor's sexual orientation.</p>

While some older generations find these evolving dynamics complicated, Gen Z prioritizes autonomy and self-discovery, exhibiting less pressure to conform to traditional sexual or relationship milestones. However, experts observe a paradox: despite being more open about sexual topics in general, many Gen Zers struggle with vulnerability and direct communication of preferences in intimate settings, often adopting a "nonchalant" attitude to avoid perceived emotional investment.</p>

In a notable shift, Martin has drastically altered his tactical approach, implementing a more pragmatic 4-2-3-1 formation, reducing possession, and utilizing longer passes. This represents a significant departure from his established coaching philosophy, indicating the severity of the situation at Ibrox.</p>
