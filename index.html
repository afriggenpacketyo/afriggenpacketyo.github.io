          <h2>Crude Oil Prices Decline Following OPEC+ Production Increase Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 10:27:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second consecutive month, U.S. crude oil futures experienced a drop of over 1%. The decision to increase output by 411,000 barrels per day in June, following a similar increase in May, has raised concerns about an oversupplied market, especially with potential recession risks stemming from U.S. tariffs. Analysts anticipate continued investment decline in exploration and production due to the weak price environment, affecting oilfield service companies. Chevron and Exxon have already reported lower first-quarter earnings compared to 2024 due to lower oil prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares have seen a staggering 5,502,284% increase since Warren Buffett took over in 1965, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 39,054% rise over the same period. This equates to a compounded annual return of 19.9% for Berkshire, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%. The company's success reflects Buffett's strategic investment decisions over six decades, transforming Berkshire from a failing textile company into a diversified conglomerate. Buffett's decision to step down as CEO after 60 years marks the end of an era, with Greg Abel set to take over the role, while Buffett will remain as chairman.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing Iran's oil exports, Tehran continues to export between 1.2 million and 1.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, primarily to China, relying on clandestine operations to evade detection. This shadow industry involves tactics like tankers going dark, ship-to-ship transfers, and forged documentation. The U.S. has lost leverage over China due to the tariff war, making financial sanctions less effective. Analysts suggest stronger enforcement and closer cooperation with local governments in Asia are needed to address the enforcement gaps.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its May meeting, making a significant drop in mortgage rates unlikely. While a rate cut is not anticipated for May, there is a possibility that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could hint at a potential rate cut in June, which could lead to a slight decline in mortgage rates. Borrowers looking to secure an affordable mortgage rate should focus on improving their credit score and shopping around for the best terms. Proactive monitoring of the market is advised to capitalize on any opportunities that may arise.</p>

Roughly 80% of the $TRUMP token supply is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliates. The contest has supercharged demand for the coin — and lined the pockets of its creators.

          <p>Collection activity on federal student loans has resumed after a five-year pause, impacting millions of borrowers in default. The restart coincides with significant changes and disruptions to the lending system, including the blocking of the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan. Borrowers may face higher monthly bills and declining credit scores. Some student loan borrowers report waiting hours on the phone before being able to reach someone about their debt. Restarting collections while the federal student loan system is facing so much uncertainty "will further fan the flames of economic chaos for working families across this country,".</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's new regional security model, introduced before his Southeast Asian tour, reflects China's ambition to become a regional security provider while excluding external interference, particularly from the U.S. The model echoes Xi's 2014 call for Asians to manage their own security independently, capitalizing on regional doubts about Washington's reliability. Analysts caution that Beijing's efforts to project itself as a benign security partner face challenges due to territorial disputes with neighbors and escalating rivalry with Washington. The new framework aligned with Xi’s “Asian Security Concept”, articulated at the 2014 Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Shanghai.</p>

The debate highlights a divide between fiscal conservatives seeking to cut spending and Republicans representing areas benefiting from clean energy investments. As he presses to\nroll back policies to combat climate change and to unravel Mr. Biden’s legacy, Mr. Trump has moved to defund the Biden-era law, and hard-right Republicans are demanding its repeal.</p>
