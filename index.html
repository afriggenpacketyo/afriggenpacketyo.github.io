            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant upswing after the White House announced temporary tariff exemptions for key consumer electronics, reversing concerns about President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw substantial gains, with Apple shares soaring due to its reliance on a China-based supply chain. However, Trump cautioned that this reprieve would be temporary, with tariffs potentially shifting to a new national security classification, creating uncertainty for tech companies. Global markets also responded positively, with gains seen in Asia and Europe following the announcement.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's tariff war has increased the cost of imported research supplies for science labs in both the United States and China. Experts suggest that US labs may initially be more affected due to the high cost of essential items like glassware, reagents, spectrometers, and DNA sequencers. The tariffs could significantly impact the infrastructure of modern science, potentially doubling the price of lab equipment. This situation puts US labs at a disadvantage, potentially hindering scientific progress and innovation.</p>

She suggests that disabled individuals are often more prepared for the challenges of early parenthood due to their familiarity with navigating a body that rebels and requires care. Disabled parents are accustomed to innovating and problem-solving, skills that are highly valuable in parenting. Embracing imperfection and accepting help are also key lessons that disabled parents often learn, allowing them to be more flexible and compassionate caregivers.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe to prevent its closure, employing emergency powers to secure raw materials and direct operations. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, is the last in the UK producing virgin steel, deemed vital for major construction projects. The government intervened after Jingye reportedly intended to halt material purchases, risking furnace shutdown. The move averts immediate job losses and ensures continued domestic steel production, though the long-term ownership and financial viability remain uncertain.</p>

This move reflects a broader trend of investment shifting towards the Midwest, which has seen apartment prices steadily increase due to a lack of housing supply. The region is attracting new businesses and experiencing job growth, fueling demand for housing.</p>

While rates are higher than in previous years, careful planning and comparison can lead to affordable options. (not investment advice)</p>
