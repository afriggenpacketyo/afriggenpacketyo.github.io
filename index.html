          <p>Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner has publicly supported late-night host Jimmy Kimmel following his indefinite suspension by ABC. In a social media post, Eisner criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for what he termed "out-of-control intimidation" of Disney and ABC, which preceded the network's decision to pull the show. Eisner questioned the state of corporate leadership in the face of such pressure and reaffirmed his view of Kimmel as a talented and funny performer. The suspension came after Kimmel made controversial comments regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling it "decidedly improper and impermissible." While tossing the lengthy 85-page complaint for being filled with "vituperation and invective," Judge Steven Merryday is allowing Trump's legal team to refile a more concise, 40-page version within 28 days. The judge criticized the original filing as a political document rather than a serious legal complaint. The lawsuit also targets four reporters and publisher Penguin Random House over a book about Trump's finances.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Virginia's Eastern District are reportedly concerned that their acting U.S. attorney, Eric Siebert, could be fired for not pursuing a mortgage fraud case against New York Attorney General Letitia James.

The potential prosecution of James follows her successful civil fraud lawsuit against Trump and his organization in New York.

          <p>Veteran NFL defensive end Jadeveon Clowney was arrested for misdemeanor charges of trespassing and failure to identify just two days before signing a contract with the Dallas Cowboys. The incident occurred in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where police reports state he parked in a closed lot despite being instructed not to. Clowney, a three-time Pro Bowl player, was released by the Carolina Panthers in May and is now entering his 12th NFL season. The arrest did not prevent his signing, which was announced by Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after the team's Week 2 game.</p>

          <p>A vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has significantly altered U.S. COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. The committee voted to advise that vaccination for individuals aged 6 months and older should be based on "shared clinical decision-making" with a healthcare provider, moving away from a universal recommendation. The new guidance emphasizes that the vaccine's benefits are most favorable for those at high risk of severe disease. This change, which still requires CDC adoption, reflects the influence of new, more skeptical panel members and could impact vaccine access and insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested Article 4 consultations with its NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes. The Estonian government condemned the incursion as a "brazen" and "extremely dangerous provocation," summoning Russia's chargé d'affaires in protest. NATO confirmed its jets immediately responded to and intercepted the Russian aircraft, which were flying without transponders or flight plans. This marks the second time in a week a NATO member has invoked Article 4, which triggers urgent talks when a member's security is threatened, escalating tensions along the alliance's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has revealed significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party marketplace. The report found that as Walmart rapidly expanded its e-commerce platform to compete with Amazon, its seller vetting processes became more lax, allowing bad actors to use stolen business identities to sell fake goods. Shoppers have received counterfeit items, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly, contributing to what some experts describe as a "Wild West" environment on the platform, undermining customer trust.</p>

Unlike letters from past presidents that emphasized the nation's founding on ideals, President Trump's message focuses on forging a "sacred bond with our Nation, her traditions, her history, her culture." This reframing aligns with a broader rhetorical shift on the right that defines America more as a cultural nation than a creedal one.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, in a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The yield climbed to 4.127% as investors balanced the Fed's monetary policy against signs of a resilient U.S. economy. While the Fed's cut was aimed at managing risks, strong economic indicators, like a recent dip in jobless claims, have tempered concerns about a slowdown. Investors in longer-term debt are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, including future growth, inflation, and government borrowing needs. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite his "golden-boy" image, Redford often portrayed characters whose athletic or personal deftness was a double-edged sword, leading to Pyrrhic victories. Films like *Downhill Racer*, *The Candidate*, and *Quiz Show* are highlighted as examples of his deep-seated distrust of the American obsession with winning at all costs. The article suggests Redford's legacy is that of a thoughtful artist who used his platform to explore complex truths.</p>
