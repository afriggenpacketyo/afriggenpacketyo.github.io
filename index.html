          <p>Sir John Curtice analyzes Reform's success in recent local council elections, noting the party won most votes and seats. The article explains that Reform's appeal is concentrated among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019. The party performed well in wards that heavily favored leaving the EU and among working-class voters with fewer educational qualifications. The results indicate a need for both Conservatives and Labour to appeal to this segment of the electorate to recover from their losses.</p>
