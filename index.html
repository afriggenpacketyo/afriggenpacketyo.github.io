Carmakers will also qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of imported components, phased out over two years. However, a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles remains in place, which analysts say will still raise prices for new and used cars.</p>

While experts agree that phthalates are harmful, they cautioned that the study relied on statistical modeling and assumptions, making it difficult to determine the exact number of linked deaths.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order easing some automotive tariffs that his administration had put in place earlier this month. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts will still take effect, but vehicles assembled in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years. Trump said the changes would help automakers during this "little transition."</p>
