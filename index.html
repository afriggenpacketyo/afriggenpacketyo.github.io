        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the recent U.S. strikes targeted Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself, emphasizing the administration's goal to dismantle the program rather than engage in a broader conflict. Vance claimed the strikes had substantially set back Iran's nuclear capabilities, though he couldn't definitively confirm complete destruction of facilities. He mentioned the administration's intention to address the remaining enriched uranium and warned Iran against retaliation, promising a forceful response. The administration, according to Vance, seeks to eliminate Iran's nuclear program without pursuing regime change or a protracted Middle East conflict. Optimism surrounding the containment of nuclear proliferation is tempered by the risk of escalation. </p>

          <p>Senator Tim Kaine voiced strong disapproval of President Trump's unilateral military action against Iran, emphasizing that Congress should authorize any war against Iran. He argued that the Constitution requires congressional consultation and approval before offensive military actions. Kaine highlighted the risk to U.S. troops in the Middle East and questioned the necessity of the strike, particularly given claims that Israel had already set back Iran's nuclear program. He expressed concern about being misled into another war, similar to the lead-up to the Iraq War.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jonathan Turley argues that Democratic outrage over President Trump's military actions in Iran without congressional authorization is hypocritical, citing past instances where Democratic presidents took similar actions without facing such criticism. He points to President Obama's 2011 military campaign against Libya and President Clinton's cruise missile attacks in 1998 as examples of unilateral actions supported or met with silence by Democrats. Turley notes the War Powers Act has been largely ineffectual and presidents have often asserted their inherent powers to conduct such attacks. He suggests that Trump's actions, while risky, are consistent with historical precedent and case law, questioning the grounds for impeachment based on war powers. The article highlights the long-standing debate over presidential war powers and the selective application of constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>Bimco, a major shipping organization, warns of heightened threats to commercial shipping in the Arabian Peninsula following U.S. strikes on Iran. The organization anticipates potential attacks on U.S. warships and ships affiliated with Israel or the U.S., but warns against ruling out attacks on other merchant vessels. They suggest Iran might disrupt shipping in the Strait of Hormuz using anti-ship missiles, drones, or sea mines, potentially impacting global energy prices and supply chains. Freight rates from Shanghai to Jebel Ali have already surged, reflecting increased risk. The shipping industry faces increased uncertainty and potential disruptions in the region.</p>

Egypt's EGX30 emerged as a significant gainer, closing 2.7% higher. Analysts suggest the Gulf's emphasis on peaceful resolution has shielded it from major market turmoil.

          <p>A National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The bulletin notes the potential for low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and warns that cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may target U.S. networks. It also cautions that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to attack targets in the U.S. The advisory emphasizes the need for vigilance and awareness of potential threats. Law enforcement agencies are taking precautionary measures to protect vulnerable sites.</p>

          <p>The U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites involved decoy bombers and "misdirection" to maintain secrecy, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine revealed that decoy B-2 stealth bombers flew toward Guam to divert attention, while the actual bombers flew under the cover of darkness. The mission involved a U.S. submarine launching Tomahawk cruise missiles and a total of 14 bunker buster bombs. Caine stated that Iran did not deploy fighters or surface-to-air missiles during the mission, suggesting the element of surprise was maintained. The operation highlights the complexity and precision of modern military operations.</p>

          <p>The article argues that President Trump's decision to bomb nuclear sites in Iran without congressional approval undermines American democracy by depriving citizens of representation and accountability. It contrasts this with the 2002 authorization for the Iraq War, which allowed for public debate and electoral consequences for lawmakers. The author contends that bypassing Congress denies voters the ability to hold their representatives accountable for the outcome, potentially leading to radicalization. The author believes that unilateral actions like these remove official channels for citizens to effect change. The author worries that this might set a precedent for future leaders.</p>

The ACLU argues that the redistricting process involved taking a small chunk of St Petersburg with a high minority population and adding it to an area of Tampa, effectively diluting Black voting power. The ACLU's lawyers argue that the new district is not contiguous and that the redrawing of districts has been used to diminish the votes of people of color.
