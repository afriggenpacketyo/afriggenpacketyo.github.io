          <p>The White House has stated that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within a couple of weeks if given the order by its supreme leader. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that Iran possesses all the necessary components and technology to achieve this, posing an existential threat to Israel, the United States, and the world. President Trump is reportedly considering military action against Tehran and will make a decision within two weeks, partly based on his instincts and the possibility of negotiations. Correspondence between the U.S. and Iran has continued, though it's uncertain if U.S. envoys will attend talks in Geneva. The article's content is heavily focused on the potential for nuclear conflict and political decision-making. </p>

          <p>The White House has applauded the Supreme Court's decision to uphold a Tennessee law that prohibits puberty blockers and other treatments for transgender minors. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a "huge victory for America's children," asserting the administration's strong belief that young children should not undergo chemical castration and mutilation. The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, was initiated by transgender minors and their families, with the Biden administration initially joining as a plaintiff. The 6-3 ruling stated that the law did not classify on any bases warranting heightened review, prompting praise from Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti. The article highlights the political and legal dimensions of transgender rights and the ongoing debate surrounding medical treatments for minors.</p>

          <h2>Plastic Bag Bans Show Positive Impact on Shoreline Pollution</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effectively reducing plastic bag litter on coastlines. Analyzing data from over 45,000 beach cleanups, researchers found that local and state plastic bag policies decreased plastic bag waste by up to 47% between 2016 and 2023. Fee-based policies proved more effective than full or partial bans, highlighting the importance of policy design. California's experience, with an initial ban leading to a rise in thicker plastic bag waste, underscores the need for stricter laws and fewer loopholes. The article emphasizes the role of legislation in curbing plastic pollution and protecting marine life.</p>

          <p>The article examines why Israel has not yet struck Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, a site of significant concern due to its deep underground location and potential for concealed nuclear weapons development. Despite claims from Israeli military officials that Iran is close to developing a nuclear bomb, U.S. intelligence agencies have previously stated they do not believe Iran is currently building one. Experts suggest that Fordo's location, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain, makes it a challenging target, potentially requiring the use of a U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bomb. The article highlights the strategic considerations and technical challenges involved in targeting Iran's nuclear infrastructure.</p>
