          <p>U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed Representative Chip Roy for Texas Attorney General, aiming to succeed Ken Paxton who is running for the U.S. Senate. Cruz praised Roy, his former chief of staff, as a "battle-tested warrior" and the best-equipped candidate to defend conservative values and the Constitution in the state. Roy is one of several Republican candidates in the race, but Cruz's endorsement highlights their long-standing political alliance and shared conservative principles. The endorsement positions Roy as a prominent contender in the upcoming election to become the state's top law enforcement officer.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, has dismissed claims that Chinese ownership of American farmland constitutes a national security threat. Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total U.S. farmland, arguing the amount is too insignificant to impact food security. He characterized efforts to restrict such purchases as unfounded political manipulation disguised as national security concerns. The ambassador emphasized that these actions are intended to undermine agricultural cooperation between the two nations for narrow political agendas.</p>

          <p>Sunday's UK newspaper headlines are dominated by stark economic warnings and political controversies. The Sunday Telegraph reports that leading economists fear Britain is approaching a 1970s-style debt crisis that could necessitate a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, a claim the Treasury dismisses as unfounded. Other major stories include Labour's planned overhaul of the asylum appeals system to address the use of hotels for migrants, as reported by the Sunday Times. Meanwhile, the Sunday Express criticizes the Home Office for awarding large bonuses to senior staff amid what it calls a spiraling migrant crisis.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers lost their preseason finale to the San Francisco 49ers 30-23 in a game marked by numerous mistakes from the backup players. Coach Jim Harbaugh expressed disappointment over the high number of turnovers and penalties, which contrasted with the team's cleaner performances earlier in the preseason. Despite the sloppy play, some individuals stood out, such as undrafted linebacker Marlowe Wax, who made several key defensive plays, potentially securing a spot on the 53-man roster. The game served as a final, and for some, troubling, audition before Tuesday's roster cuts.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has condemned President Donald Trump's plan to send National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it an abuse of power and an attempt to manufacture a crisis. This follows the deployment of troops to Washington D.C., another Democrat-led city, as part of a proclaimed crackdown on crime. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson echoed these concerns, stating the city has not been officially informed and that an uncoordinated deployment could heighten tensions.

          <p>The star-studded cast of the film adaptation of 'The Thursday Murder Club,' including Pierce Brosnan and Dame Helen Mirren, has spoken about the pressure of meeting fan expectations. Brosnan admitted to feeling a "huge responsibility" to the millions of readers of Richard Osman's bestselling book series. The film, directed by Chris Columbus and produced by Steven Spielberg's company, brings together Brosnan, Mirren, Sir Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie as a group of retirement village residents who solve murders.

          <p>Russian officials have reported that a Ukrainian drone attacked the Kursk nuclear power plant, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. According to the plant's operators, the drone detonated upon impact, damaging a transformer, but radiation levels remain normal and there were no casualties. The alleged attack occurred as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day, marking its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. Ukraine has not commented on the accusation, which heightens concerns about the security of nuclear facilities amid the ongoing war, a point of repeated warnings from the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma mother and stepfather, Cherie and Dustin Walker, are facing felony child neglect charges after their 11-year-old daughter gave birth to a full-term baby at home without medical assistance.

The couple claims they were unaware of the pregnancy, an assertion met with disbelief by authorities who highlighted the severe trauma experienced by the young girl. Authorities are awaiting paternity test results to identify the baby's father and anticipate filing additional charges in this disturbing case.</p>

The redesign removes the iconic image of a man in overalls leaning against a barrel, which has drawn criticism from conservative commentators and marketing experts for abandoning its traditional branding. The company's shares fell 7.2% on Thursday as Wall Street reacted to the change, which is part of a broader effort by CEO Julie Felss Masino to refresh the chain's image.

          <p>A severe heatwave is affecting more than 50 million people across the Western United States this weekend, with heat alerts active from Arizona to Washington. Cities such as Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and Phoenix are under extreme heat warnings, with temperatures expected to soar into the triple digits. This prolonged period of extreme heat is particularly dangerous for regions like the Pacific Northwest, which are less accustomed to such conditions. The high temperatures are also fueling elevated fire weather concerns in Southern California, where red flag warnings are in effect due to the combination of heat, low humidity, and wind.</p>

          <h2>Parents Advocate for Adding Pea Protein to Allergen Labels After Son's Near-Fatal Reaction</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A family is calling for peas and lentils to be added to the UK's list of 14 legally required food allergens after their nine-year-old son, Rex, suffered a severe anaphylactic shock. The reaction was caused by pea protein used in the glaze of a hot cross bun, an unexpected ingredient that was not highlighted on the label. Experts and other families shared similar stories of severe reactions to pea protein, which is increasingly used in food products but not widely recognized as a major allergen. They argue that clear labeling is essential to prevent what one parent described as playing "a game of roulette" with their children's safety.</p>

          <p>A bus transporting the Aliquippa Junior High football team crashed on Saturday morning near Pittsburgh, resulting in at least 21 students and the driver being hospitalized. The bus, carrying 28 people, was en route to a game when it veered off the road on a bend, struck a hillside, and hit a utility pole. One student was reported to be in critical condition and undergoing surgery, while most other patients were treated and discharged. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro expressed his support for the community, and the school district has canceled next week's football activities and will provide mental health resources.</p>

          <p>One of the first international tourists to visit North Korea's new Wonsan Kalma coastal resort has described a tightly controlled and surreal holiday experience. The Russian tourist was part of an organized group that was constantly accompanied by guides and security guards, who stated their purpose was to prevent interactions with locals. The visit included strict rules, such as prohibitions on photographing construction sites and wearing revealing clothing, set against a backdrop of pristine, nearly empty beaches. This new resort, built near a missile testing site, is part of Kim Jong Un's plan to boost tourism, though access remains highly restricted.</p>

          <p>According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, U.S. defense officials have been blocking Ukraine from using American-supplied long-range missiles, such as ATACMS, to strike deep inside Russian territory. This restriction is reportedly part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A review mechanism has been implemented, giving the U.S. Defense Secretary final approval over the use of these weapons, which also affects allied systems like Britain's Storm Shadow cruise missiles that rely on U.S. targeting data. The policy reflects a cautious approach aimed at preventing further escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Nationally top-ranked Mater Dei High School began its football season with a 26-23 victory over Ft. Lauderdale Aquinas in Florida. The Monarchs established a dominant 26-3 lead by halftime, largely thanks to new quarterback Ryan Hopkins, who threw three touchdown passes in the second quarter. However, the team struggled in the second half, committing numerous costly penalties and allowing Aquinas to close the gap. Despite the sloppy play and a scoreless second half, Mater Dei's defense made key stops to hold on for the win, giving the coaching staff plenty to address before their next game.</p>

New York City was the only U.S. city to make the top 10, landing at number four due to its walkability, food, and culture, though it scored poorly on affordability.

          <p>As the UK Parliament's e-petitions system marks its 10th anniversary, its actual impact on policy remains a subject of debate. While the platform allows the public to directly engage with Parliament, with petitions over 100,000 signatures considered for debate, many feel the government responses are often dismissive. One notable success was Finn's Law, which increased protections for police service animals following a popular petition. However, the largest petitions, such as those calling to reverse Brexit, failed to change government policy, leading some to view the system as an illusion of influence rather than a genuine tool for change.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in their early 20s are turning to anti-wrinkle injections, or "preventative Botox," to stop lines from forming before they become permanent. Proponents, including some medical professionals, argue that starting early can relax facial muscles, reduce skin creasing, and potentially negate the need for more invasive procedures later in life. However, other experts are skeptical, warning that it is a waste of money to treat wrinkles that do not yet exist and cautioning against the societal pressure to pursue anti-aging treatments at such a young age. The long-term effects of starting these treatments early remain largely unstudied.</p>

The proposal redraws the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, a move pushed by former President Trump to bolster the party's chances in the 2026 midterm elections. The bill's passage follows a weeks-long standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and block the vote.
