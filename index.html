          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of National Guard troops to several Democrat-led cities, including Chicago and Portland, citing out-of-control crime and protests. This move has faced strong opposition from state governors like Illinois' JB Pritzker and Oregon's Tina Kotek, who accuse Trump of manufacturing a crisis and abusing power. A federal judge in Portland temporarily blocked the deployment of Oregon's National Guard, but Trump circumvented this by reassigning California Guard members. The deployments, which also include Texas National Guard members to Illinois, raise significant legal and constitutional questions about federal intervention in state matters.</p>

          <p>During a Buffalo Bills game against the New England Patriots, a fan in a Matt Milano jersey caught an errant pass from quarterback Josh Allen in the end zone. Instead of celebrating, the fan immediately ran from his seat and headed for the exit, stunning NBC broadcasters. Stadium ushers did not attempt to stop him from leaving with the football. This incident follows another odd moment earlier in the season when a Bills fan was banned for hitting a Baltimore Ravens player after a touchdown.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing sector is increasingly relying on industrial robots to counter a declining population and labor shortages. Last year, Chinese factories installed nearly 300,000 new robots, accounting for over half of global installations. These machines are taking over simple, repetitive tasks, allowing the nation to maintain its competitive edge in manufacturing despite demographic shifts. Experts suggest this trend is inevitable, enabling China to sustain and enhance its industrial capabilities through technological advancement and an increasingly educated workforce.</p>

Sanchez was hospitalized after a "physical disturbance" involving another man, who sustained apparent stab wounds. Police stated the two men knew each other, indicating it was not a random act of violence. Sanchez, an analyst for FOX Sports, was in town for a game, and his agent confirmed he is in stable condition.</p>

          <p>A 60-year-old man was arrested in Sydney, Australia, after allegedly firing up to 100 bullets at random passersby, injuring 20 people. The incident occurred on a street in the Inner West, with one man sustaining a serious gunshot wound and 19 others treated for shrapnel or shattered glass injuries. Police seized two rifles from the scene, but the gunman's motive remains unclear, with no known links to terrorism or gang activity. Mass shootings are rare in Australia due to strict gun laws implemented after a 1996 tragedy.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged over 4% to reach a record high after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. The market's early gains were driven by real estate, technology, and consumer cyclical stocks. Takaichi is expected to maintain an accommodative monetary policy, supporting a "high-pressure economy" focused on expanding investment and demand through public-private partnerships. The yen weakened, while bond yields saw mixed movements.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million Apple and Samsung smartphone users in the UK could be entitled to a share of a £480 million payout if a consumer campaign group, Which?, wins its case against US tech giant Qualcomm. The group accuses Qualcomm of anti-competitive practices, alleging the company forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices for essential components, which then increased smartphone costs for consumers. The trial, expected to last five weeks, will determine if Qualcomm abused a dominant market position, potentially leading to individual payouts of around £17.</p>

The pharmacy chain had initially filed for Chapter 11 in October 2023 to reduce debt and close underperforming locations, also settling allegations of improperly filling opioid prescriptions.

          <p>The term 'swag gap' is gaining traction on TikTok to describe relationships where one partner is significantly more fashionable or puts more effort into their appearance than the other. While some view this as a potential source of conflict, leading to feelings of disrespect or mismatched vibes, others argue it doesn't have to be negative. Relationship experts caution against trying to change a partner's style, emphasizing that true compatibility extends beyond aesthetics. Ultimately, a successful relationship requires mutual respect and support, regardless of differing fashion senses, ensuring neither partner feels insecure or resentful.</p>

          <p>Cyber attacks are inflicting significant financial and operational damage on UK businesses, with incidents like the one at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) highlighting the vulnerabilities. JLR's cyber attack led to a month of lost production, costing an estimated £50 million per week, and severely impacted its vast supply chain. Other high-profile victims include Marks & Spencer and the Co-op, incurring hundreds of millions in losses. Experts note that the reliance on "just-in-time delivery" models in industries like automotive and retail makes businesses particularly susceptible to widespread disruption from these attacks, which are often perpetrated by ransomware groups.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump is effectively compelling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to alter his stance on the Gaza conflict, despite Netanyahu's previous assertions. Trump's recent ultimatum for a peace plan and subsequent demand for an immediate halt to bombing in Gaza led to Netanyahu's prompt acquiescence, reversing earlier commitments. This dynamic highlights Trump's considerable leverage over the Israeli leader, who has historically presented his alliance with Trump as a political asset. The article argues that Trump's transactional approach balances diverse stakeholder interests, rather than solely aligning with the Israeli right's agenda, and this influence is crucial for any potential peace deal.</p>

Beyond the intense demands, some departures are linked to unease over Musk's political and social views, which employees find challenging to reconcile.

          <p>Fianna Fáil candidate Jim Gavin has withdrawn from the Irish presidential election with immediate effect, citing a "mistake that was not in keeping with my character and the standards I set myself." Gavin's decision follows a news report alleging he owed money to a former tenant, an issue he addressed during a presidential debate by stating he was investigating the matter. Taoiseach Micheál Martin supported Gavin's withdrawal, acknowledging it was a difficult decision but the correct one to avoid controversy tainting the office of Uachtarán na hÉireann. Gavin, a former Dublin gaelic football manager, had previously sent legal letters over online "smears."</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week after a major cyber attack forced a month-long shutdown of its factories and impacted its global operations. Manufacturing will initially resume at the engine plant in Wolverhampton, with other sites gradually returning to full capacity over several weeks. The cyber attack, which cost the company an estimated £50 million per week, severely pressured JLR's vast network of suppliers, prompting the government to underwrite a £1.5 billion loan guarantee. While a welcome relief, the recovery process is expected to be gradual and complex.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a French woman known for her public stance against sexual violence, is returning to court to face one of her sexual assailants who is appealing his conviction. Last year, 51 individuals were convicted of sexually assaulting her after she was drugged by her husband. Despite the initial optimism her defiance generated, campaigners note that substantive changes in France's approach to sexual violence are lacking, with conviction rates flat-lining despite increased reporting. The case continues to highlight ongoing challenges in combating sexual violence and impunity in France.</p>

          <p>China is aggressively challenging Nvidia's long-standing dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, driven by substantial state investment and a push for technological self-reliance. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have unveiled new chips, with Huawei announcing a three-year plan to directly compete with Nvidia. While some experts caution about the lack of verifiable data, China's vast talent pool and intense domestic competition are seen as significant strengths. Beijing's anti-monopoly probe into Nvidia and US export restrictions further underscore the escalating tech rivalry, though China remains reliant on high-end American technology for its most advanced projects.</p>

          <p>Families experiencing rare and severe vaccine-related injuries are turning to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), often referred to as "vaccine court," for financial redress. This program, established in the 1980s, aims to compensate individuals without requiring proof of negligence, shielding vaccine manufacturers from extensive liability to ensure continued vaccine production. While serious injuries are exceedingly rare, the VICP has paid out nearly $5 billion to around 12,000 Americans, covering conditions ranging from shoulder injuries to neurological issues. However, the COVID-19 vaccine is not yet included in the VICP, and the court faces a significant backlog of cases, leading to criticism regarding delays in compensation.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested Joseph Mayuyo, a 33-year-old Hawthorne man, in connection with online threats made against TikTok's Culver City headquarters. The threats, received via social media on Friday, prompted the evacuation of the Bristol Parkway location. Authorities traced the threats to Mayuyo's home, where he initially resisted arrest and made further online threats, declaring he would not be taken alive. Crisis negotiators intervened for 90 minutes before Mayuyo surrendered, and he has since been booked on a charge of making criminal threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to significantly hike H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has prompted India to actively encourage its skilled professionals to return home. Policymakers in Delhi view this as an opportune moment to reverse the long-standing brain drain, particularly in technology and medicine. While anecdotal evidence suggests a growing interest among Indians in the US to relocate, experts emphasize that a large-scale reverse migration will require concerted government effort beyond current initiatives. The rise of Global Capability Centres in India offers new opportunities, but a strong sense of purpose and robust incentives are needed to truly lure back top talent.</p>

          <p>The government has announced significant reforms to the housing market, aiming to reduce costs, cut delays, and halve failed property sales, potentially saving first-time buyers hundreds of pounds. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated the changes will "fix the broken system" by legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide key property information upfront, including home condition and leasehold costs. Proposals also include introducing binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals from deals, which currently cost the UK economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. These reforms are part of a broader housing strategy that also pledges to build 1.5 million new homes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mohamed Salah's perceived lack of defensive work is becoming a concern for Liverpool, particularly in matches against stronger teams. While his offensive freedom has made him a potent goalscorer, the players behind him are struggling to provide adequate cover, leading to defensive overloads on the right flank. This tactical imbalance was evident in a recent loss to Chelsea, which exploited the space. While Salah's goal-scoring form is not a major worry, the article suggests Liverpool needs to improve its defensive setup and overall control of games, especially after a disappointing run of results.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers examines how imperial China's political ideas, often expressed through art, continue to inform Western societies today. He highlights the value of visual evidence in understanding historical societal norms and intergroup relations, citing examples like a Han dynasty prime minister's story illustrating jurisdictional boundaries. Powers argues that art actively participates in political debate, conveying ideas about authority and privilege. The concept of "honour," as described by Montesquieu, where power grants arbitrary privilege, is shown to be a recurring theme in both Eastern and Western aristocracies, demonstrating enduring political parallels across cultures.</p>

Trump recounted Jackson's alleged comparison of him to Barack Obama and George W. Bush, emphasizing his own perceived strength and health. This claim was made amidst a speech that also touched on drug interdiction efforts and criticisms of the government shutdown.</p>
