          <h2>The Decline of Deep Reading and its Impact on Politics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 06:05:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the decline of deep reading and its potential impact on politics, arguing that digital media's displacement of books is propelling society back to an ancient mode of cognition and communication. It explores how the mind can skim over the surface of a sentence, but deep reading requires sustained engagement with longform text, activating a wide array of the brainâ€™s linguistic and cognitive capacities. The author draws parallels between ancient oral cultures and today's digital one, suggesting that this reversion to "orality" underlies much of today's political dysfunction, with print media laying the foundations for liberal democracy. The piece posits that as deep reading declines, the electorateâ€™s commitment to pluralism, objectivity, and the rule of law is swiftly receding.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces accused Iran of violating the ceasefire agreement shortly after Prime Minister Netanyahu announced Israel's acceptance of it, while Iranian state television denied launching missiles toward Israel. IDF Chief Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir stated they would respond with force to the severe violation, and Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to respond forcefully with strikes against regime targets in Tehran. The conflicting reports and accusations highlight the fragile nature of the ceasefire and the ongoing tensions between the two countries.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article critiques the Democratic party's support of Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race, arguing that it mirrors Trump's embrace of vulgarity and cruelty. The author contends that the Democratic leadership is prioritizing conservative and combative figures, abandoning decency and overlooking talented candidates like Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander. The author suggests this embrace of a figure accused of sexual harassment represents a moral failure and a lack of imagination within the Democratic party, potentially alienating voters and squandering valuable talent. The endorsement of Cuomo signals a willingness to compromise principles for perceived political expediency.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, is vying for the position of New York City mayor, hoping to rehabilitate his image and potentially launch a presidential run. He is facing a strong challenge from Zohran Mamdani, a progressive state representative endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cuomo's campaign is heavily funded by wealthy donors, including some with ties to the Republican party, and has focused on attacking Mamdani's democratic socialist views. Cuomo relies on his name recognition and government experience, emphasizing his record of delivering results, while Mamdani criticizes Cuomo's past actions and associations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to attend a NATO summit in Brussels, focusing on defense spending and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The summit occurs shortly after Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump aims to secure a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense, although a firm timeline for this goal remains unclear. Discussions will also address Russia's war in Ukraine, with the U.S. urging restraint and direct talks between the involved parties.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies is still struggling to advance to the 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process, as evidenced by an analysis of its latest laptop hardware. The MateBook Fold Ultimate Design laptop features Huaweiâ€™s Kirin X90 system-on-a-chip (SoC), manufactured by SMIC using its 7-nm process node. This finding suggests that Huawei has not yet made the leap to SMICâ€™s 5-nm process, which is difficult to scale due to US sanctions restricting the sale of advanced chipmaking equipment to Chinese fabrication plants. Huawei's slow progress in securing 5-nm chips means the company is multiple generations behind its US rivals, impacting its competitiveness in the tech market.</p>

          <p>President Trump's popularity has declined during his second term, with disapproval ratings exceeding approval on key issues like the economy and immigration. The article suggests a paradox: Trump's popularity decreases when he is at the center of attention, actively pursuing his agenda, and recovers somewhat when he recedes into the background. This trend is attributed to negative polarization and a "thermostatic" electorate, which prefers the opposite opinion to that of the president. The public's reaction to Trump's policies, such as immigration enforcement, demonstrates this pattern of disapproval following high-profile actions.</p>

          <p>A proposed tax deduction of up to $10,000 on annual interest for new auto loans, as part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would primarily benefit buyers of expensive vehicles. To fully utilize the deduction, a loan of approximately $112,000 would be necessary, implying a vehicle purchase price of around $130,000. The tax break is limited to individuals with annual incomes below $100,000 or married couples earning less than $200,000. Qualifying cars must also receive final assembly in the U.S., potentially further limiting the potential roster of vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>
