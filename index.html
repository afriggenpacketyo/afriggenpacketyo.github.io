          <p>Student-led protests in Belgrade have intensified, culminating in clashes with police and a clear ultimatum to the government for snap parliamentary elections. Demonstrators, initially peaceful, have adopted new "outsmarting" tactics, relocating to avoid direct confrontation, as blockades spread across Serbia. President Aleksandar Vučić continues to reject early elections, but conditions on the ground suggest sustained and decentralized pressure, raising concerns about the country's political stability and potential for prolonged civil resistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking its second consecutive monthly decline and defying analyst predictions for slight growth. This unexpected downturn was primarily driven by a significant drop in manufacturing output and "very weak" retail sales, indicating a fragile outlook for national economic expansion. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment but affirmed her determination to stimulate growth amidst prevailing high inflation and interest rates. Experts suggest that the government's financial buffer has been eroded by policy decisions, implying difficult fiscal choices and muted growth prospects in the medium term.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Native Hawaiian man, Kaulana Alo-Kaonohi, faces a potentially longer prison sentence after a U.S. appeals court upheld his hate crime conviction for a 2014 attack on Christopher Kunzelman, a white man, in Maui. The jury had found Alo-Kaonohi and another man were racially motivated when they beat Kunzelman with a shovel for attempting to move into their remote village. Prosecutors successfully cross-appealed the initial sentence, arguing for the application of a hate crime enhancement. The Hawaii Innocence Project plans to challenge the conviction, contending that the defense failed to adequately present the historical context of the word "haole" to the jury.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has asserted that the new "one in, one out" migrant scheme, recently agreed with France, is sufficiently robust to withstand anticipated legal challenges. The pilot program, signed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, proposes that for each migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one who has made a legal asylum claim there, aiming to deter illegal Channel crossings. While Cooper emphasized extensive preparatory work to ensure legal soundness, shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticized the plan as a "gimmick." The article notes that migrant numbers have reached record levels this year.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a renowned IVF pioneer and professor, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) in protest against planned five-day strikes by resident doctors. The doctors are set to walk out from July 25-30 over a pay dispute, despite a recent 5.4% pay rise. Lord Winston, a BMA member since 1964, argued in an interview that striking completely disregards the vulnerability of patients and that the country is already struggling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting criticized the strike as "unnecessary and unreasonable," warning that it threatens an NHS already "hanging by a thread" amidst efforts to reduce wait times.</p>

          <p>China has undertaken a significant environmental initiative by blowing up 300 dams and shutting down hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the Yangtze. This drastic measure aims to restore the river's habitat, which serves as a crucial refuge for rare and endemic fish species in the Yangtze's upper reaches. Decades of dam construction had severely restricted water flows, reduced suitable habitats, and blocked migratory routes for fish, leading to ecological degradation.
