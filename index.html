          <p>Shares in Ørsted, the world's largest offshore wind developer, fell by over 25% following the announcement of a planned $9.4 billion rights issue. The company cited "material adverse development" in the U.S. market, specifically the suspension of new wind leases by the Trump administration, which prevented a planned partial sale of its Sunrise Wind project. This move created a significant funding gap, forcing the Danish state-backed company to raise capital directly from its existing shareholders to support its investment and business development programs.</p>

          <p>A decade after the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision, the Supreme Court is being formally asked to overturn it for the first time. The petition comes from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, who argues the original ruling was "egregiously wrong." This legal challenge coincides with a renewed conservative campaign to reverse the precedent and softening support among Republicans, raising concerns among LGBTQ advocates despite legal protections like the Respect for Marriage Act.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite public awareness, less than 10% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, with experts highlighting significant systemic hurdles. The sheer variety of plastic types, many of which are not mechanically recyclable, and the widespread use of hazardous chemical additives complicate the process, often degrading the quality of recycled materials or rendering them toxic. While innovative solutions like 'microfactories' offer some hope, experts stress that effective global policy, including a strong UN Plastic Treaty and reduced production, is essential to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, are investigating a potential link between a man's death and a "brutal" attack on a local priest. A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a body was found in a house on Sunday. The discovery is suspected to be connected to an earlier incident where Fr. John Murray was assaulted with a bottle in his church as he prepared for his final Mass before retirement. The priest is in stable condition, and the community has held vigils for both him and the deceased man.</p>

A Polish research team found his bones, along with personal items, at the foot of Ecology Glacier on King George Island, carried there by the glacier's movement over decades. His 86-year-old brother expressed astonishment and relief, stating that the discovery brings a long-awaited sense of closure to his family.</p>

          <p>Two suspects led law enforcement on a dramatic, hour-long chase through Los Angeles, carjacking multiple vehicles before ultimately escaping. The pursuit, captured on live television, began with a stolen pickup truck and saw the suspects attempt several carjackings before successfully commandeering a large big rig. They later ditched the semi-truck for another pickup, at one point driving the wrong way on an interstate. The chase spanned numerous LA neighborhoods before the suspects, considered armed and dangerous, fled on foot and remain at large.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs have led to a substantial increase in federal revenue, with customs and excise taxes reaching over $29 billion in the last month alone. This revenue, primarily paid by American businesses and consumers, now accounts for a larger share of federal income but remains a small fraction compared to income taxes. While significant, economists note this income is unlikely to make a major dent in the $37 trillion national debt, as Trump has suggested, and may not even cover the cost of recent tax cuts, especially as tariffs can also slow overall economic growth.

The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) number indicates how much UVB radiation, which causes sunburn, is filtered; SPF 30 is generally recommended and should be reapplied every two hours. The star rating on many products measures protection against UVA rays, which are associated with skin aging and cancer. For optimal protection, consumers should choose a sunscreen with both a high SPF and a high star rating, and remember that no product offers 100% protection.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Tesla has formally applied for a license to become an electricity supplier in the United Kingdom, potentially competing with established energy firms. The application, submitted by Tesla Energy Ventures, follows the model of its Tesla Electric service in Texas, which allows customers to optimize energy use and sell excess power back to the grid. This move into the UK energy market comes as the company faces a significant slump in its European electric vehicle sales, including a nearly 60% drop in the UK last month.</p>

          <h2>Beijing Eases Home-Buying Restrictions, Prompting Speculation That Shanghai and Shenzhen May Follow</h2>

          <p>Beijing's municipal government has surprisingly eased long-standing restrictions on home purchases, a move seen as a proactive effort to bolster the struggling property market. The new policy allows eligible families to buy homes in the city's suburbs, outside the Fifth Ring Road. Analysts view this as a positive signal of the government's willingness to stimulate the market and believe it could prompt other major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen to relax their own buying curbs. The timing was earlier than expected, helping to strengthen market confidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. semiconductor firms Nvidia and AMD have reportedly reached an unusual agreement with the Trump administration to resume selling AI chips to China. The deal reverses a previous export ban but requires the companies to pay the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from these sales. While the administration claims the approved chips are less advanced, the move has drawn criticism from national security experts who fear it could accelerate China's AI capabilities. The agreement highlights the complex balancing act between economic interests and national security in U.S.-China tech policy.</p>

          <p>The question of how life began on Earth remains a profound scientific mystery, with water playing a central role in leading hypotheses. Scientists are investigating two primary theories: one suggesting life emerged in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and another proposing it started in shallow tide pools. The critical role of water in these origin stories is also guiding the search for extraterrestrial life. Researchers are focusing on "water worlds" in our solar system, such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, as potential locations where similar life-generating processes could occur.</p>

          <p>Turkey's top football clubs, including Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, are spending record-breaking sums on international stars, rivaling the financial power of Saudi Arabia's league. This lavish spending occurs despite the clubs carrying over a billion euros in combined debt and the country facing economic struggles. Analysts suggest the government tacitly supports this spending to distract the public from economic problems, a form of "bread and circuses" politics. The clubs receive state support through restructured loans and capital increases, allowing them to operate with close ties to political power.</p>

Both men suffered subdural hematomas; Kotari died after a 12-round draw, and Urakawa died following a knockout loss. The tragic deaths have prompted the Japanese Boxing Commission to reduce championship bouts from 12 to 10 rounds and schedule an emergency meeting to discuss further safety measures, putting the sport's risks under intense scrutiny.</p>

The blaze broke out on Sunday afternoon during one of the city's busiest festival weekends, sending a large plume of smoke over the city and forcing the closure of parts of Holyrood Park. Four fire appliances were initially dispatched to the scene, with two remaining on Monday to manage the situation. No casualties were reported in the incident, which follows several wildfire warnings in Scotland this summer.</p>

Guehi has entered the final year of his contract and appears unwilling to sign a new deal, though he is reportedly open to staying until his contract expires in 2026. After rejecting a £65m offer from Newcastle in January, Palace would now prefer to cash in on the player, with Liverpool reportedly interested but hoping to pay less than the club's £40m valuation.</p>

The vast majority were arrested for displaying support for a proscribed organization after the government designated the direct-action group as a terrorist organization. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's history of violence and criminal damage, while protesters, including many elderly individuals, argued their right to peaceful protest was being illegally restricted.</p>

          <p>For the last two seasons, all three teams promoted from the Championship have been immediately relegated from the Premier League, a trend that newly-promoted Burnley, Leeds, and Sunderland hope to break. Historically, 40 points was the benchmark for survival, but in the last decade, the average needed has dropped to around 32 points. A financial gap created by league rules puts promoted clubs at a disadvantage. Analysis suggests a team's performance in its first ten games is a strong indicator of its ultimate fate for the season.</p>
