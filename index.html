          <p>According to a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. credit card debt rose to $1.21 trillion in the second quarter, matching last year's all-time high. The report also highlighted that delinquency rates remain elevated, with 6.93% of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past year. Researchers noted that subprime borrowers, particularly younger cardholders, are showing increasing signs of financial strain. This trend suggests that while many consumers are managing, a significant portion of households are financially vulnerable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments have significantly influenced prediction markets regarding the next Federal Reserve chair. He spoke highly of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, referring to them as "both Kevins," causing their odds on the Kalshi prediction market to jump to 35% each. The speculation comes as current Chair Jerome Powell's term is set to end in May 2026. The potential appointments are being closely watched, as both Hassett and Warsh have previously advocated for lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase fell by over 5% after the company announced a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes. The decline adds to a recent downturn, with the stock now down more than 30% from its record high in July. The drop occurred amid a broader market dip and as the stock's strong momentum from earlier in the year begins to wane. Despite a disappointing second-quarter revenue report, some analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects due to legislative momentum and crypto market demand.</p>

          <p>David Black, the chief executive of the UK's water regulator Ofwat, has announced he will resign at the end of the month. His departure comes as the government plans to scrap Ofwat and create a new watchdog to address systemic failings in the water sector. The industry has faced widespread criticism for issues like sewage spills and leaking pipes. A recent report blamed Ofwat, the government, and water companies for the industry's poor state, recommending major reforms and increased investment.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests the Proud Boys have become surprisingly quiet during Donald Trump's second term, a stark contrast to their high-profile presence in previous years. The article attributes this decline in public activity to internal fractures, including disavowals of former leader Enrique Tarrio, and the fact that the administration's aggressive policies on immigration and other issues align with the group's own goals. With the government itself enacting their agenda, such as through ICE's mass-deportation campaign, these far-right groups have less to rally around, causing them to remain more underground.</p>

          <p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has officially ended the requirement for federal employees to document five weekly accomplishments in an email.

          <p>A high-stakes political battle is underway in Texas, where Republicans are pushing to redraw the state's congressional map mid-decade in an effort to gain up to five House seats. This move has significant national implications, as it could expand the GOP's fragile majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. In protest, Texas Democrats have fled the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote. The standoff has prompted Democratic governors in states like California and New York to threaten retaliatory gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>Warwickshire Police have forcefully denied accusations of a cover-up regarding the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton. The claim was made by a local council leader, who asserted that the police and Home Office concealed the fact that two men charged in the case were asylum seekers. In a public letter, the Chief Constable stated the force's priority was supporting the victim and that they "did not and will not cover up such criminality," clarifying that they followed national guidance by not releasing immigration status upon charging.</p>
