          <p>Amazon plans to invest approximately $4 billion by the end of 2026 to expand its delivery network in rural towns across the U.S. This initiative aims to add over 200 delivery stations, effectively tripling the size of Amazon's rural delivery capabilities. The company anticipates that this expansion will significantly reduce average delivery times for customers in these areas, cutting them in half. Amazon emphasizes its commitment to serving rural customers despite the increasing costs faced by other logistics providers. </p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced that Publishers Clearing House (PCH) will issue over $18 million in refunds to approximately 282,000 consumers who were allegedly misled by the company's deceptive practices. The FTC's 2023 lawsuit claimed that PCH used 'dark patterns' to trick customers into believing they needed to make a purchase to enter sweepstakes or increase their chances of winning. The FTC also alleged that PCH sent emails with deceptive subject lines that resembled official government documents.

          <p>The NFL has fined the Atlanta Falcons $250,000 and assistant coach Jeff Ulbrich $100,000 after Ulbrich's son admitted to making a prank call to prospective NFL draftee Shedeur Sanders during the NFL draft. Ulbrich's son, Jax, obtained Sanders' number from an open iPad belonging to his father and the team. The prank call involved Jax impersonating the New Orleans Saints' general manager and falsely informing Sanders that the Saints would be drafting him.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite campaign promises to cut spending, the Trump administration has spent over $200 billion more in the first 100 days compared to the same period last year. This increase is attributed to factors such as mandatory spending on programs like Social Security, Medicare, and military expenditures, which the White House has limited control over. The rising national debt and higher interest rates have also contributed to the increase in spending. While the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has focused on smaller spending cuts, these efforts have had a minimal impact on the overall budget.</p>

Justices debated the application of the First Amendment's religion clauses, weighing the prohibition of state establishment of religion against the protection of free exercise of religious faith.

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are influenced by several factors, including the federal funds rate, the prime rate, loan-to-value ratio, credit score, and miscellaneous economic data.

The Federal Reserve's rate decisions have a major impact, as do the median rates banks charge customers.

The storm system brought destructive wind damage, with gusts as high as 90 miles per hour. The National Weather Service is investigating potential tornado damage. The same system also affected southern Quebec in Canada, where a teenager was critically injured.</p>

          <p>The first 100 days of the Trump administration have been marked by market turmoil following the chaotic rollout of tariffs. The S&P 500 experienced its worst start to a presidential term since 1974, with more than $6.5 trillion wiped from the value of public companies. The announcement of double-digit tariffs on countries across the globe incited the worst two-day sell-off for the S&P 500 since March 2020. The turmoil prompted investors to question the United States’ role at the heart of the financial system.</p>

The decision could affect laws in 46 other states that authorize charter schools.</p>

The policies' future is uncertain, relying on executive actions that a future administration could reverse.</p>
