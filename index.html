          <p>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced that Southeast Asian nations aim to form a united front to address economic challenges arising from U.S. tariffs and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. Anwar seeks a joint meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss these tariffs, hoping it will occur later this year. ASEAN has established a task force to coordinate a response to the U.S. tariffs, complementing bilateral negotiations by member countries. The region's economies, heavily reliant on exports to the U.S., are significantly impacted by the Trump administration's tariff measures.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to voice their concerns about "unilateral tariff measures" at their meeting in Malaysia. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim noted that the global trading system is strained by the imposition of U.S. tariffs.

With the economy struggling, politicians are wary of alienating young male voters who feel they face reverse discrimination.

This action follows criticism of the government's perceived ineffectiveness in managing escalating rice prices amidst broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. This shift is intended to exert greater influence over prices and address public concerns about the cost of the nation's staple food.</p>

Von der Leyen secured a tariff delay to July 9 to allow more time for negotiations. This decision marks a reversal from Trump's earlier threat to impose the tariffs on June 1, citing stalled discussions with the EU.

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests that China should lower its annual GDP growth target for the next five years to around 4%. This recommendation considers potential protracted rivalry with the United States and the necessity to address deep-rooted structural issues within China. Xu emphasized that focusing on employment expansion and debt ratio control is crucial. This is as the market estimates annual growth of around 4.5 percent from 2026-30, he said the potential growth rate and growth target figure should be around 4 percent in the next five to 10 years, owing to China’s shrinking population, its falling savings and production rate, and other headwinds.</p>

The article details 30 to 40 "super critical" targets, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, whose destruction could trigger a chain collapse of fundamental infrastructure systems. This "urban collapse warfare" tactic could achieve maximum effect with minimum military cost, creating favorable conditions for a "win without fighting."
