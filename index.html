          <p>The Trump administration is discontinuing a dedicated LGBTQ+ youth option within the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline due to funding issues. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) stated that the "Press 3 option" will cease to exist, redirecting resources to serve all help seekers. Critics like Jaymes Black of The Trevor Project argue this move will deprive over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people of life-saving services, especially during Pride Month. Senator Tammy Baldwin also condemned the decision, emphasizing the importance of supporting LGBTQ+ individuals in crisis. Optimism surrounding the situation is limited given the potential harm to a vulnerable population.</p>

Currently, rates for both are similar, but HELOCs have variable rates that can change, unlike fixed-rate home equity loans. The article provides calculations based on different scenarios, including rate increases and decreases, to help borrowers make informed decisions. Borrowers should compare offers carefully to ensure borrowing success, and remember that both options can be refinanced in the future (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump likely acted within his authority in federalizing the California National Guard amid immigration raid protests. The court blocked a lower court order that would have returned control of the guard to Governor Newsom, citing violence during the protests as justification. The judges stated that Trump's decision was likely lawful under a section of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, and that Governor Newsom had no power to veto the President's order. This ruling allows the Trump administration to maintain control of the guard while the case proceeds through the courts.</p>

This decision could undermine California's efforts to promote zero-emission vehicles and reduce planet-heating emissions.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he doesn't anticipate tariffs significantly boosting inflation. Waller believes easing should begin to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market. He suggested moving cautiously but starting the process, as the data has been fine during the six-month pause. These comments led to gains in stock market futures, but it remains unclear whether Waller's position will garner broad support within the Federal Open Market Committee (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In light of a recent incident involving a suspect impersonating a police officer, many Americans are questioning their legal rights when law enforcement knocks on their door. According to the Fourth Amendment, police need legal authority to enter a home, and individuals are not obligated to answer the door or let them in without a warrant. Texas law outlines exceptions for warrantless searches, including exigent circumstances like protecting life or preventing evidence destruction. If police knock without a warrant, remaining calm and polite while asserting the right to remain silent is advisable.</p>
