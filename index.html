          <p>Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, is set to sign an executive order aimed at resisting the Trump administration's planned immigration crackdown in the city. The order will affirm that Chicago police will not collaborate with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement and directs city departments to use all available legal avenues to oppose federal efforts. This move comes in response to the White House's plans to increase the presence of federal agents in Chicago and other Democratic-run cities to ramp up arrests of undocumented immigrants, a policy that has drawn sharp criticism from local and state officials.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has canceled his scheduled trip to Beijing, where he was to attend a parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The decision was made as widespread protests, initially sparked by lawmakers' pay, have intensified and spread beyond the capital city of Jakarta, with some regional parliament buildings being set on fire. A presidential spokesperson stated that Prabowo wishes to remain in the country to monitor the situation directly and find solutions to the unrest, which represents the first significant challenge to his government since he took office.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has advanced its efforts to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi by submitting an improved bid valued at £35 million, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, requesting an additional £5 million in bonuses, and talks between the two clubs are actively ongoing ahead of the transfer deadline. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, compelling Palace to consider a sale to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer. The potential transfer is also linked to Palace's own efforts to secure two new central defenders.</p>

          <p>In a unique collaboration, Hamburg's Astra St. Pauli Brewery has partnered with condiment maker Hela to create a limited-edition beer named "Currydurst" (Currythirst). The new brew infuses the spicy, smoky flavor of Hela's iconic curry ketchup into a 6.5% alcohol Astra beer, paying homage to the city's beloved Currywurst street food culture. This unconventional beverage merges two local staples, aiming to capture the essence of a popular Hamburg snack in liquid form. With only 2,000 liters being produced, the creation is a novel experiment testing the boundaries of traditional beer flavors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea FC has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, recalling him to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was prompted by a serious hamstring injury sustained by fellow Chelsea striker Liam Delap, which could sideline him for up to eight weeks and leave the team with only one fit forward. The sudden reversal has reportedly angered the 24-year-old Jackson, though attempts may be made to salvage the deal. This unexpected development highlights the precarious nature of player transfers and squad depth in professional football.</p>

In response, the city administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing frequency of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

          <p>In a unique performance titled "Sarabande Africaine," Afropop superstar Angélique Kidjo and world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma joined forces at the Hollywood Bowl to explore the African roots of classical music. The concert highlighted the historical connections between African dance rhythms and Baroque compositions like the sarabande, famously used by Bach and Handel. Kidjo's powerful stage presence transformed works by Gershwin and Ravel, while Ma's cello seamlessly integrated with a vibrant ensemble of African drummers and Caribbean musicians. The collaboration was a celebration of cross-cultural musical dialogue and shared artistic heritage.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that such use constitutes a planning breach and public safety risk. However, councils in West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne have confirmed they will press on with their own legal challenges. The government maintains that using hotels is a temporary measure, but the issue remains a contentious flashpoint for protests and political debate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most trading partners are illegal, stating they represent an overreach of his emergency economic powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used as justification, does not grant the president the authority to impose taxes or duties. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for a likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. This decision marks a significant legal setback for a cornerstone of Trump's economic and trade policy.</p>

While it is not possible to receive both full benefits at the same time, the Social Security Administration allows an individual to choose the higher of the two amounts. The article explains the eligibility requirements for survivor benefits, which depend on age, disability status, and marital status. It also outlines strategies, such as starting with survivor benefits and later switching to one's own retirement benefit to maximize the total lifetime payout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a landmark study on Iowa's water quality pointed to agricultural pollution as a major contributor, public officials have quietly cut the funding intended for promoting the report's findings. The $1 million study, which took two years to complete, linked farming practices to contaminants in drinking water sources for 600,000 people and growing public health concerns, including high cancer rates. Critics suggest the move is an attempt by the politically powerful farm industry and its allies to downplay the report's conclusions and impede efforts to address the state's persistent water pollution problems.</p>

She suggests that while markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy.
