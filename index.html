        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly a decade ago, the United States and other world powers reached a landmark nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which imposed restrictions on Iranâ€™s civilian nuclear enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord, reimposing economic sanctions on Iran, arguing that the deal was defective at its core. Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time to accumulate enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon, prompting renewed concerns and stalled negotiations, as Trump threatens potential military action against Iran to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons, as delegations from Iran and the U.S. have met for multiple rounds of nuclear negotiations, though talks have stalled amid the conflict between Israel and Iran. The article provides an overview of the deal's contents, the reasons behind Trump's withdrawal, and the subsequent developments, including increased monitoring of Iran-backed operatives in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials have increased surveillance of Iran-backed operatives in the United States as President Trump considers potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The FBI has intensified efforts to monitor possible domestic sleeper cells linked to Hezbollah since Israel's Operation Rising Lion offensive began. This heightened vigilance stems from long-standing concerns about Iran's capacity to orchestrate attacks within the U.S., which have escalated since the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020. The article also notes that Trump is expected to make a decision on potential U.S. strikes against Iran within the next two weeks, amidst threats of retaliation from Iran.</p>

          <p>European officials are increasingly worried about China's economic overcapacity and the potential impact on European industries. The EU fears that overinvestment and state subsidies in China, combined with weak domestic consumption, are leading to a flood of subsidized Chinese exports into Europe. This situation could decimate European companies in sectors like industrial machinery, chemicals, and renewable energy, resulting in job losses and political instability. The article highlights Ursula von der Leyen's warning about a new 'China shock' and the need for Beijing to address its overcapacity issues to avoid a backlash.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, potentially due to the failure of a high-pressure nitrogen tank. The explosion occurred during preparations for a test firing of the rocket's Raptor engines, causing a large fireball and scattering debris. While SpaceX is investigating the cause, the incident raises concerns about the timeline for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on Starship for lunar landings, but NASA expressed support for SpaceX and their continued development.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by 20 Democratic-led states, who argued that the administration was unlawfully withholding federal funds to coerce them into adhering to Trumpâ€™s immigration agenda. The judge agreed with the states, stating that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, as the states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding that Congress appropriated.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against the government's plans to cut disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill but opposed cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit. The government defends the reforms as necessary to fix a broken welfare system and ensure support for those with the most severe disabilities. The proposed bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit, leading to concerns from Labour MPs and potential rebellion from backbenchers.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has issued new guidelines for members of Congress visiting detention centers, requiring 72 hours' notice, which experts argue are illegal and impede congressional oversight. Several Democratic members of Congress have been denied entry to immigrant detention facilities, prompting accusations that the Trump administration is attempting to conceal conditions within these facilities. A federal statute states that funds may not be used to prevent a member of Congress from entering detention facilities for oversight purposes, but ICE claims the new rules are necessary for safety and security, as Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) slammed the policy, calling it a smokescreen to deny member visits to ICE offices across the country.</p>

Computer simulations indicate that passing stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years.

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees have significantly reduced plastic bag litter during shoreline cleanups. Local and state policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced plastic bag waste by up to 47%, with fee-based policies proving more effective than partial bans. The study also suggests that these policies may reduce harm to marine life, and the findings highlight the importance of well-designed legislation in curbing plastic pollution.</p>

The U.S. may use a Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb, requiring a B-2 bomber, and the potential strike raises concerns about regional escalation.</p>

          <p>'28 Years Later,' directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, adopts a more ambitious position than the original by extending its geographic coverage and placing us in the midst of a supposedly idyllic rural community that serves as a seemingly safe haven for those who have so far escaped the virus in an England that has been separated from the world. Spike ends up being the real protagonist of a story that feels more intense than it already is due to his participation and what he is forced to do in a world threatened not only by the infected of the first installment, but by three different classes of "creatures" as a product of an unusual evolution that becomes an excuse for the presentation of a particularly risky circumstance that will give much to talk about. Visually, the film, which was largely filmed with iPhones 15 Pro Max, keeps us constantly entertained, although full acceptance of its staging will largely depend on what you think of Boyle's style, a director who is not exactly adept at classicism, but seeks to impress with his choice of shots, his camera movements, the use he makes of music and the way he edits his works.</p>
