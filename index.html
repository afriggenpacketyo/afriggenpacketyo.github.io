          <p>An AARP survey reveals a significant increase in retirees depending on Social Security for their income compared to two decades ago, with about two-thirds now relying on it substantially. This growing dependency coincides with declining public confidence in the program's long-term stability, as it faces potential benefit cuts starting in 2034. The survey also highlights a widespread lack of understanding among Americans about how Social Security functions, even as a record number of people file for benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is concluding its work for the week and starting its August recess earlier than scheduled, a move that prevents votes on motions concerning the Jeffrey Epstein case files. House Speaker Mike Johnson characterized the Democratic-led efforts to force these votes as "political games," asserting the Department of Justice is already handling the matter appropriately. This decision postpones other planned legislative votes, coming amid recent DOJ actions to increase transparency in the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases.</p>

          <p>At the prestigious International Mathematical Olympiad, AI models from Google and OpenAI achieved gold-medal-level scores for the first time, solving five of the six complex problems. Despite this milestone, human contestants performed better, with five students achieving perfect scores, something no AI model managed. The rapid improvement of these AI systems, which solved the problems within the competition's time limit, highlights the accelerating progress in artificial intelligence capabilities. Experts suggest this signals a significant step toward developing human-level cognitive abilities in machines.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has announced plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell in the near future to determine what information she may have about Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities. This development comes as the Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, seeks to unseal grand jury transcripts from both the Epstein and Maxwell cases. The move is seen as an effort to address criticism from some of President Trump's allies who were skeptical of the DOJ's earlier conclusion that no further evidence existed for new charges.</p>

          <p>A new legislative bill backed by the Trump administration proposes significant changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aiming to cut federal spending by $186 billion over ten years. The plan would shift the majority of SNAP benefit costs to individual states, which currently only cover half of the administrative expenses. Critics and the Congressional Budget Office warn this could lead to millions of Americans losing their food assistance, as states with balanced budget requirements may be forced to scale back or eliminate the program entirely.</p>

          <p>Target has announced the end of its 12-year-old price matching policy for items found at a lower cost on Amazon or Walmart, effective after July 28. The company stated that customers will now only be able to price match items from Target's own stores or website. According to a spokesperson, the change was made because shoppers overwhelmingly request price matches against Target's own prices rather than its competitors. This policy shift occurs as the retailer confronts declining sales and a challenging economic environment for consumers.</p>

Lynch, who died in a yachting accident last year, had maintained that HPE mismanaged the acquisition. The final amount of damages will be determined in a future hearing.</p>

          <p>Shares of department store chain Kohl's saw a dramatic and volatile surge, at one point more than doubling before settling about 30% higher. The surge, which occurred without any specific corporate news, is being attributed to the "meme stock" phenomenon, driven by retail investors on social media platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. Kohl's fits the profile of a meme stock, being a well-known legacy brand with a high percentage of its shares sold short.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the common misunderstanding of credit card grace periods, explaining that they typically apply to new purchases, not late payments. Most cards offer a window of 21-25 days after a billing cycle ends, during which a balance paid in full incurs no interest. However, this grace period is often voided if a balance is carried over from the previous month. For late payments, issuers are not required to offer a grace period, and missing a due date can result in immediate fees, penalty APRs, and eventual damage to one's credit score.

The Guatemalan government also denied that anyone matching Leon's description had been deported there. The situation grew more confusing as the man's family maintained he was in a Guatemalan hospital, while a Chilean journalist presented an alleged death certificate for a man with the same name from 2019.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates and maintained its full-year financial outlook, even as it absorbed a $1.1 billion impact from U.S. auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated the company is actively working to "greatly reduce" its exposure to these tariffs through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. The automaker confirmed its previously lowered guidance, which anticipates a potential full-year tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion. The company's stock fell despite the strong underlying performance, reflecting ongoing investor uncertainty about trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Harvard University study analyzing over 58,000 women's birthing records suggests that the odds of having a boy or a girl may not be a simple 50/50 chance. Researchers found that families exhibit a "weighted coin toss" tendency, where having two children of the same sex increases the probability that the third child will also be of that same sex. The study identified a woman's age at her first birth as a correlating factor, though the exact biological mechanism remains uncertain. The findings challenge the long-held assumption of random sex determination for each birth.</p>

The author suggests that the frustration of discerning real from fake online may encourage people to seek out more in-person interactions, physical media, and local businesses.
