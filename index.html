          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 05:03:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English government plans to extend free school meals to an additional 500,000 pupils by September 2026, regardless of parental income for those receiving Universal Credit, which will save parents £500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. This initiative, costing £1 billion up to 2029, aims to address child poverty, although the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests other measures, like lifting the two-child limit, might be more effective. The announcement has been welcomed by the education sector and anti-poverty organizations, who see it as a significant step towards alleviating hunger in schools, though some call for further action to address child poverty comprehensively. The government is expected to announce its broader child poverty strategy in the autumn.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has recovered the bodies of two hostages, Judi Weinstein-Haggai and Gad Haggai, who were taken during the October 7, 2023 attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz.

          <p>Serena Williams considers winning the 2017 Australian Open while nine weeks pregnant as the most important moment of her career. She recalls the physical challenges of early pregnancy, including fatigue and breathlessness, which forced her to rely on aces and short points. Williams kept her pregnancy a secret, with only Venus knowing, and she expressed feeling bad about competing against her sister in the final under those circumstances. Early pregnancy can be intense, with the body undergoing a huge transformation and a surge in hormones often leading to fatigue, breathlessness and nausea.</p>

          <p>Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, requires an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 additional troops to meet NATO's updated defense requirements amid growing tensions with Russia. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated that a voluntary recruiting system might not be sufficient, though conscription is not currently feasible due to capacity limitations. Germany is seeking to adapt its military posture in response to NATO's plans for collective defense, as the alliance shores up its eastern flank after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Pistorius has promoted a model that relies on voluntary service but allows for compulsory conscription if needed.</p>

Brückner, serving a prison sentence in Germany for an unrelated sexual assault case, has repeatedly denied involvement, and no charges have been brought against him regarding Madeleine's disappearance. Madeleine's parents remain determined to leave no stone unturned, marking the 18th anniversary of her disappearance last month.</p>

          <p>Boeing has agreed to pay $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, a deal described as “morally repugnant” by a lawyer for the victims’ families. The agreement with the US Department of Justice includes $444.5 million for the families and $445 million to improve compliance, safety, and quality programs. A lawyer representing victims' families criticized the deal for allowing Boeing to sidestep true criminal accountability. Two Boeing planes crashed off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, linked to faulty flight control systems.</p>

          <p>New Zealand legislators have voted to suspend three lawmakers who performed a Māori haka in protest of a proposed law, with Hana-Rāwhiti Maipi-Clarke receiving a seven-day ban and party leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi barred for 21 days. The lawmakers from Te Pāti Māori performed the haka last November to oppose a bill they said would reverse Indigenous rights. A committee recommended the punishments, stating the lawmakers were not being punished for the haka itself but for striding across the debating chamber towards their opponents while doing it. Government lawmakers rejected opposition proposals for lighter sanctions during hours of emotional speeches.</p>

Patterson has pleaded not guilty to killing three people and attempting to murder another, claiming it was a tragic accident. Prosecutors presented photos from her phone showing wild fungi being weighed, suggesting she measured the amount required to kill her guests. Patterson admitted to foraging for wild mushrooms before the lunch, despite previously denying it to police.</p>

          <p>The US-China trade truce is unraveling as Donald Trump accuses Beijing of breaching last month's deal to cut tariffs, while China claims Washington has imposed discriminatory measures. The deal, which slashed tariffs on both sides, is now threatened by disputes over rare earth exports and US access to China's markets. Confusion remains over the specifics of the agreement on rare earths, with Washington believing Beijing would completely remove export license requirements. With the 90-day pause expiring soon, prospects for a lasting ceasefire remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has implemented a travel ban restricting entry to the US from 12 countries, citing the need to protect against "foreign terrorists" and other security threats. Some countries face a full travel ban, while others are under a partial ban, with the order allowing for countries to be added or removed from the list. The ban, effective June 9, echoes a similar ban from Trump's first term. The proclamation states that America must ensure entrants do not have "hostile attitudes" towards its citizens, culture, or government.</p>

          <p>Women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro have been warned by the UK's medicines regulator to use effective contraception. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) states it's unknown if these medicines could harm an unborn baby and warns they may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese women. The MHRA advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to conceive, specifying two months for Wegovy/Ozempic and one month for Mounjaro. There are concerns that the growing popularity of these 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using them safely or receiving proper advice.</p>
