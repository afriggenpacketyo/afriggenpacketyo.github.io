          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 00:06:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its component suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics, to cease production of its H20 artificial intelligence chip. This move follows a directive from the Chinese government for local tech companies to stop purchasing the chip due to national security concerns. Beijing has raised questions about potential tracking technology or remote-access "backdoors" in the hardware, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has denied. The halt in production introduces significant uncertainty for Nvidia's business in the lucrative Chinese market, which has already been impacted by shifting trade policies and U.S. export restrictions.</p>

In Japan, core inflation for July cooled to 3.1%, a figure slightly higher than economist expectations but showing a downward trend. The upcoming address from Powell at the central bank's economic symposium is expected to provide critical insights into the future direction of U.S. interest rates, influencing global market sentiment.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the season, has started to move northeastward away from the North Carolina coast. While the storm is not projected to make landfall in the U.S., it generated life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast, prompting evacuation orders for parts of the Outer Banks. As a Category 2 storm with 100 mph winds, Erin caused significant coastal concerns, with one NOAA buoy recording a maximum wave height of 45 feet. Officials continue to warn the public against swimming at many beaches due to the hazardous conditions expected to persist for several days.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Finds Corn Plants Communicate to Adapt to Their Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants can communicate with each other by releasing a gas called linalool. This chemical signal prompts neighboring plants to alter their soil composition, which can affect both growth and defense against herbivores. The research, conducted in maize fields in China, observed that plants in the inner rows of dense fields suffered less pest damage but also exhibited reduced growth. This finding offers new insights into plant interactions and suggests that optimizing this communication mechanism could potentially be used to enhance pest resistance and improve crop yields in agriculture.</p>

          <p>Colombia is facing a severe security crisis after two separate attacks attributed to dissident factions of the former FARC group killed at least 18 people and injured dozens more. In the city of Cali, a car bomb targeting a military aviation school killed six civilians, leading the mayor to declare martial law. In a separate incident near Medellin, a drone attack on a police helicopter involved in eradicating coca crops resulted in the deaths of 12 officers. These violent events highlight the escalating challenges to the nation's peace processes and have prompted a high-level security meeting led by the country's president.</p>

          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who, along with his brother Lyle, was convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. The panel concluded that Menendez still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety, citing numerous prison rule violations as a primary factor in their decision. These violations included drug smuggling, unauthorized cell phone use, and incidents of violence. Despite support for his release from family members and Menendez's claims of acting in self-defense after years of abuse, the board determined his behavior behind bars demonstrated a lack of reform. He will be eligible for another hearing in three years.</p>

          <p>According to court documents, Elon Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to participate in a $97.4 billion bid by his company xAI to acquire OpenAI in early 2025. The proposal was part of Musk's effort to prevent OpenAI, which he co-founded as a non-profit, from transitioning into a for-profit entity. The filing, part of an ongoing legal battle between Musk and OpenAI, states that Zuckerberg and Meta were approached with a letter of intent but ultimately did not join the financing consortium.

This marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, though the latest figures show a cooling trend, partly due to easing rice prices. The "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy and is closely watched by the central bank, held steady at 3.4%. Despite the slight drop, some economists argue that the Bank of Japan is behind the curve in raising interest rates to combat sustained price pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

His day involves a mix of activities, starting with a calisthenics workout and a delicious Filipino breakfast made by his wife, Kat. The schedule also includes walking their dogs, spending hours at a Yemeni cafe downtown, and shopping for clothes.

          <p>A Vox article analyzes a recent Supreme Court decision regarding canceled NIH research grants, describing the ruling as legally incomprehensible and procedurally convoluted. The case involved whether lawsuits against the grant cancellations should be heard in federal district courts or the Court of Federal Claims. The fractured 5-4 decision, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett providing a complex deciding vote, appears to split jurisdiction, potentially forcing plaintiffs into years of litigation across different courts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent criticized the outcome as "Calvinball jurisprudence," suggesting it creates unworkable rules that ultimately favor the administration.</p>

          <p>Families who lost babies under the care of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust have expressed frustration after meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national review into maternity services. The families, who have been campaigning for an independent inquiry led by midwife Donna Ockenden, said they felt "ignored, exhausted and dismissed." They claimed the chair was poorly briefed on their case and that no meaningful progress was made. Their concerns were compounded by the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, which they believe compromises the investigation's independence and fails to address systemic issues in maternity safety.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for the online message board 4chan has declared that the company will refuse to pay fines proposed by Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, under the new Online Safety Act. Ofcom has provisionally decided to impose a £20,000 fine, with daily penalties, for the site's failure to provide information for an investigation. 4chan's legal team argues that as a U.S.-based company, it is protected by the First Amendment and that Ofcom's actions constitute an "illegal campaign of harassment." This defiant stance sets up a significant international clash over the extraterritorial reach of national internet regulations and free speech principles.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to hold a special election in November, allowing voters to decide on a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts. This move is a direct counter to a Republican-led gerrymandering effort in Texas, with the California proposal designed to create up to five new Democratic-leaning districts. Newsom framed the action as a necessary response to what he called an attempt by Donald Trump to "rig the election," stating that California would not engage in "unilateral disarmament." The contentious tit-for-tat between the nation's two largest states will significantly shape the battle for control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month period to comply with the new recommendations, after which the government may consider alternative measures if the industry fails to make sufficient changes to improve product healthiness.</p>

In freewheeling remarks, Trump also promised to upgrade the city's parks with new grass and sprinkler systems to make them resemble his own golf courses.

He highlighted the retailer's success in growing its top line, expanding margins, and managing the impact of tariffs while attracting shoppers with low prices. Simon suggested that investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by non-systemic issues like restructuring costs, arguing the company's fundamentals remain robust.

          <p>In an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales, Jeep has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Cherokee SUV. The new model, which was discontinued in 2023, marks the debut of Stellantis's first hybrid powertrain in North America, a 1.6-liter turbo-four system. The updated Cherokee is larger than its predecessor, offering 30% more cargo space and a modern, technology-focused interior. With a starting price of nearly $37,000, Stellantis hopes the iconic nameplate and new hybrid technology will help the brand reclaim its market share in the competitive midsize SUV segment amid broader company headwinds.</p>

          <p>A new global arms race is intensifying as nations pursue hypersonic missile technology, which involves weapons that travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable. China and Russia are currently considered the leaders in this field, having invested heavily in their programs for years, while the U.S. and UK are now working to catch up. These weapons pose a significant strategic threat because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. The proliferation of this technology is altering geopolitical calculations and raising concerns about a new era of strategic instability.</p>
