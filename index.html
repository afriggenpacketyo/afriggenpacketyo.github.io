          <p>During the trial of three former Memphis police officers charged in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols, testimony revealed that one officer, Tadarrius Bean, took a cellphone photo of Nichols severely injured after the beating and shared it multiple times. The officers face charges including second-degree murder, with prosecutors arguing they failed to intervene or provide proper medical assistance. Testimony also included the discovery of stolen credit cards and hallucinogenic mushrooms in Nichols' car, which the defense suggested as potential motives for resisting arrest. This article summarizes the details of the trial and the evidence presented.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have officially signed a minerals deal, granting Washington preferential access to Kyiv's natural resources in exchange for the establishment of a reconstruction investment fund. This agreement, pursued by President Trump, aims to leverage Ukraine's rare earths, critical minerals, oil, and gas as compensation for U.S. aid during the conflict with Russia. Ukrainian officials emphasize that Ukraine will determine extraction locations and resources, with the fund operating on a 50-50 basis to ensure equal partnership. However, some analysts caution that the deal could reduce Ukraine to a virtual colony.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alex Berenson argues that the media is misrepresenting the Trump administration's proposed ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. The plan doesn't require Ukraine to reduce its military size or remove Zelenskyy from power, and it doesn't limit aid from other countries. While it may involve the U.S. recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, Berenson contends this reflects the historical reality and strategic importance of the peninsula to Russia. He suggests the proposal aims to stop the fighting while allowing Ukraine to maintain its defenses and that this is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>Decades of wellness research, including the Harvard Study of Adult Development, highlight the critical role of relationships in achieving happiness. Sonja Lyubomirsky's work demonstrates that acts of kindness and gratitude can boost mood by fostering connections with others. Robert Waldinger's long-term study emphasizes that strong, trusting relationships with spouses, family, and friends are key predictors of well-being, outweighing factors like achievement and wealth. These findings suggest that prioritizing social connections can significantly enhance overall life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates continue to be elevated, with the average 30-year mortgage at 6.89% and the 15-year at 6.11% as of May 1, 2025. Experts suggest strengthening your credit profile and shopping around for different lenders to secure a better rate. Potential homebuyers should also consider shorter loan terms, as they generally offer better interest rates.

These figures come amid concerns about a global economic slowdown exacerbated by trade wars, with the U.S. economy contracting in the first quarter.

The company is attempting to boost demand through value menu offers, but U.S. comparable sales still slumped 3.6%.
