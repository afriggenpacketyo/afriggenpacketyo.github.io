            <p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reported a significant email hack in February that compromised sensitive data related to federally regulated financial institutions. The breach, which occurred over several months, exposed over 150,000 emails containing information used in examinations and supervisory oversight processes. Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood has initiated a full review of the incident with external cybersecurity experts and is addressing organizational deficiencies to prevent future attacks. The OCC is taking steps to ensure accountability for vulnerabilities that led to the unauthorized access.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil prices closed below $60 per barrel, a four-year low, due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs will escalate into a global trade war. The U.S. benchmark fell to $59.58 per barrel, while Brent crude settled at $62.82. RBC Capital Markets suggests the oil market faces a 'toxic cocktail' of recession fears and increased OPEC+ production. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argues China is in a weak position regarding the trade dispute, as the U.S. exports significantly less to China than it imports.</p>

            <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is again relying on President Trump to persuade Republican holdouts to support the Senate-approved budget bill, which is essential for funding Trump's agenda. Several GOP representatives are publicly opposed to the bill, citing concerns about deficit reduction. Johnson needs to secure enough votes to pass the bill before the House enters a two-week recess, and the White House is offering commitments and assurances to sway the holdouts. Passage of the budget legislation is crucial for initiating the process of crafting the larger budget bill that encompasses much of Trump's domestic policy goals.</p>

            <p>Advocates are criticizing the State Department's decision to cut $1.3 billion in foreign aid, which includes terminating USAID contracts supporting the delivery of food, water, and medicine to populations in Afghanistan, Yemen, and other countries. The World Food Programme (WFP) warned that these cuts could amount to a 'death sentence' for millions facing extreme hunger. The WFP confirmed that the U.S. government has terminated funding for emergency food assistance in 14 countries.</p>

            <p>China has criticized Vice President JD Vance's comments referring to the U.S. borrowing money from 'Chinese peasants' as 'ignorant and impolite.' This comes as President Trump continues to implement sweeping tariffs, which have heightened trade tensions between the two countries. China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian reiterated China's position on economic and trade relations with the U.S. Vance defended the U.S. tariffs as a necessary measure to counter a 'globalist economy' that has not benefited ordinary Americans.</p>

            <p>While the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration's ability to deport accused members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, experts are questioning the federal government's characterization of the gang as a widespread threat. Federal officials have relied heavily on clothing and tattoos to identify individuals as gang members for deportation purposes, but experts argue that these symbols are not reliable indicators. They also suggest that the gang's presence is overstated, with most criminal cases clustered in states with large Venezuelan migrant populations.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates have increased to their highest level in over a month, reversing recent improvements due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage jumped significantly, reflecting the bond market's volatility. Experts suggest that the initial drop in rates was a knee-jerk reaction to economic fears, while the subsequent rise reflects a reassessment of the situation. The market is awaiting new economic data, including consumer and producer price index reports, for further direction.</p>

            <p>President Trump has touted falling oil prices and borrowing costs as positive indicators of his tariff policy, but experts suggest these trends are warning signs of a potential economic slowdown. They explain that declining oil prices and Treasury yields often indicate expectations of diminished energy demand and increased investment in safe-haven assets like bonds, reflecting concerns about economic growth. While these factors may offer some short-term relief to consumers, they are unlikely to offset the broader economic pain of a downturn.</p>

Buffett has also discussed the stock market, noting that bear markets can be an investor's best friend, offering opportunities to buy good companies at discounted prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The pro-Trump hedge fund manager warned Sunday on X that “we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter” unless Trump took a more deliberate approach, likening the full tariff activation “economic nuclear war.”</p>
