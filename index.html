          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, an expert at the Royal United Services Institute assesses potential Iranian responses, including attacks on U.S. military assets in the Middle East and closure of the Strait of Hormuz. The expert notes that U.S. military installations in the Gulf are vulnerable due to Iran's arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles. The expert also discusses the possibility of asymmetric warfare tactics, such as state-sponsored terrorism and cyber attacks, emphasizing the long-term threat they pose. The article highlights the potential for global economic disruption if Iran attempts to block the Strait of Hormuz. Optimism around the situation is tempered by the reality that conflict is a likely outcome.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are backing an amendment to block the government's welfare reform bill, raising concerns about planned cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. The amendment cites concerns about increased poverty, inadequate consultation, and insufficient impact assessments on jobs and health. If the amendment is selected and supported by a majority of MPs, the bill's passage through Parliament would be halted. The government holds a working majority of 165, meaning that 83 Labour MPs would need to oppose the bill to force a parliamentary defeat. The debate highlights divisions over welfare policy and the potential for parliamentary challenges to government legislation.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to resume deporting migrants to third countries without additional due process requirements, reversing a lower court order. The court's conservative majority did not provide an explanation, but noted the stay would terminate should the administration lose on appeal. Justice Sotomayor, along with Justices Kagan and Jackson, dissented, accusing the court of condoning "lawless" behavior by the administration and undermining the principle of due process. The ruling allows the resumption of expedited removals of unauthorized immigrants to countries other than their own. The decision is a win for the Trump administration's immigration policy, but is criticized by immigrant advocates.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, President Trump claimed "monumental" damage, while experts offer more cautious assessments. Gen. Dan Caine indicated severe damage to all three sites but noted that a full assessment is pending. Experts agree that while Iran's capabilities have been degraded, they have not been entirely eliminated, as enriched uranium and scientists remain. The article also discusses potential Iranian responses, such as retaliation through proxies or a shift in nuclear policy, including withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The long-term implications of the strikes on Iran's nuclear ambitions remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has stayed a lower court order that required people set to be deported to countries other than their own to be allowed to challenge their deportation orders. The order focused on a flight of several men from various countries which was initially headed to South Sudan but ended up in the East African country of Djibouti. The U.S. government says the men are violent criminals, convicted of crimes including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and robbery, and they don't deserve to stay in the U.S. The court's three liberals dissented.</p>

The most immediate economic consequence could be a spike in oil prices due to disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz. Over 40,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in the Middle East face increased threats. The article also suggests that the strikes may make Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons more likely, as diplomacy appears dead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea's training session in Philadelphia was cut short due to scorching heat, with temperatures reaching 36C and the heat index at 41C. Coach Enzo Maresca expressed concerns about expending too much energy in such conditions before facing Espérance. Predictions that the temperature will drop to 34C when Chelsea and Espérance, kick off at 9pm local time on Tuesday will be counteracted by it being expected to feel like 40C. Critics have also warned Fifa about extreme heat risks at the Club World Cup, with some matches being played in uncovered stadiums.</p>
