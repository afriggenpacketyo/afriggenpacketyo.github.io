          <p>Budget retailer Poundland has successfully averted administration after its turnaround plan received High Court approval, preventing a critical cash shortage by early September. The comprehensive rescue package includes a significant £90 million cash injection from private equity firm Gordon Brothers and a crucial three-year deferral of £276.5 million in outstanding loans. While the restructuring will unfortunately lead to the closure of 68 stores and two distribution sites, impacting around 1,000 jobs, the company aims to stabilize its finances and return to growth. This strategic move focuses on revamping product ranges and lowering prices to deliver a simpler, more customer-centric shopping experience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumer confidence experienced a slight decline in August, reversing some gains from the previous month and continuing a downward trend observed earlier in the year. This dip in shopper sentiment follows a weak jobs report and new tariffs imposed by President Trump, despite a lower-than-expected inflation report easing some price increase concerns. The Conference Board's index fell 1.3 points to 97.4, a crucial indicator for the nation's economy, as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged a "challenging situation" with a hiring slowdown and tariff-driven inflation, hinting at a possible interest rate cut.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Prosecution has charged Farhad N., an Afghan national, with two counts of murder and 44 counts of attempted murder following a car attack in Munich last February. The suspect allegedly drove his car into a trade union demonstration, killing a 37-year-old woman and her 12-year-old daughter, and severely injuring many others. Prosecutors state his motive was "excessive religious motivation," claiming he sought to kill Germans indiscriminately in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries. The Higher Regional Court in Munich now awaits approval of these charges, bringing a legal step forward in this tragic event.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook's refusal to resign after President Trump's attempt to fire her supported the mortgage fraud claims against her. Lutnick stated that "the crook always says 'I'm not going anywhere'," echoing Trump's allegations that Cook made false statements on mortgage applications. Cook, who has not been charged, maintains Trump lacks authority to fire her and has vowed to fight the ouster. The Justice Department is investigating the claims, which stem from Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who has also criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Over one hundred U.S. human rights, faith-based, and civil rights organizations are demanding Secretary of State Marco Rubio secure the release of Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim, a 16-year-old dual American-Palestinian citizen imprisoned by Israel for six months. Ibrahim, accused of rock-throwing, is reportedly suffering from deteriorating health, including scabies and significant weight loss, in Ofer prison. The coalition argues his detention violates the Fourth Geneva Convention and highlights the broader issue of Palestinian children in Israeli military detention. This organized pressure campaign underscores concerns about the U.S. government's protection of Palestinian-American families in the West Bank.</p>

          <p>For individuals seeking to increase their calcium intake without relying solely on dairy, experts highlight a variety of surprising food sources crucial for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Beyond traditional dairy products like yogurt and cheese, non-dairy milks, calcium-fortified juices and cereals, and tofu made with calcium are excellent alternatives. Registered dietitians also recommend canned fish with bones, such as salmon and sardines, and certain vegetables like kale, broccoli, and bok choy. If a balanced diet still leaves concerns about calcium levels, consulting a doctor about supplements is advised, prioritizing natural food sources whenever possible.</p>

President Trump is reportedly rethinking how the U.S. finances its defense capabilities, with Lutnick suggesting the current system is a "giveaway."

          <p>Current and former FEMA officials have issued a "Katrina Declaration," warning Congress that the Trump administration's proposed cuts and leadership changes threaten to undo decades of post-Hurricane Katrina reforms. The letter, signed by 181 individuals, alleges that Trump's appointees lack qualifications and that staff reductions "hinder the swift execution of our mission." It criticizes the termination of grants for state and local disaster preparedness, arguing these actions risk "effective dissolution of FEMA itself." The administration defends its reforms as necessary to combat inefficiency and red tape, while acknowledging the challenge of change for those invested in the status quo.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo redesign, which removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" figure, sparked significant public backlash and a nearly $100 million drop in company value. Brand experts attribute this "flop" to the company going against its established "brand story" and replacing a symbolic logo with a generic one. The article explains that for a legacy brand like Cracker Barrel, deeply tied to a "homestyle country cooking" image, severing its design from its roots alienates a core customer base emotionally invested in its traditional aesthetic. While a revamp was due, experts emphasize the importance of honoring legacy while attracting new customers.</p>

Divers retrieved animal bones, stone tools, and a seal tooth from the site, which was submerged by rapidly rising sea levels post-ice age.

The policy's details are still unclear, making precise price hike forecasts difficult. Trump claims tariffs haven't caused inflation and primarily benefit the U.S. Treasury, aiming to bring furniture manufacturing back to American states.

          <p>Investors may qualify for 0% capital gains taxes in 2025, offering an opportunity to realize profits without a tax bill, particularly as the stock market remains near record highs. While President Trump's "big beautiful bill" didn't alter capital gains rates directly, new deductions could reduce taxable income, expanding eligibility for the 0% bracket. Notably, a temporary $6,000 tax break for older Americans (doubled for married couples) further lowers taxable income, presenting a "golden opportunity" for strategic asset sales. This article explains how these provisions, alongside standard deductions, can benefit investors, especially those over 65, in managing their tax liabilities. (not investment advice)</p>
