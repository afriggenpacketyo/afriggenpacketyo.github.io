          <p>A man has been convicted of murdering his wife by stabbing her over 25 times in Bradford, UK, as she was pushing their infant son in a pram. The court heard that the victim, Kulsuma Akter, had been living in a women's refuge after the perpetrator, Habibur Masum, had previously threatened her. Masum had tracked her location before carrying out the fatal attack in April 2024 after she refused to leave with him. He was also found guilty of stalking and making a threat to kill.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have formally agreed to a framework for a trade deal, aiming to de-escalate economic tensions between the two nations. The agreement reportedly centers on China increasing its approval of rare earth mineral exports, which are vital for U.S. tech and defense industries, in exchange for the U.S. canceling a series of restrictive measures. The deal also addresses China's efforts to control the flow of fentanyl precursors. This development follows a series of high-level talks and aims to stabilize a relationship strained by punitive tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Zinke stated that while he agrees the federal government has mismanaged these lands, the solution is improved management and access, not selling them off. His stance creates friction with some Senate Republicans, like Mike Lee of Utah, who have advocated for the land sale provision as a way to address issues like housing prices.

The article suggests that Gulf states, seeing a weakened Iran, may now seek a more balanced relationship to ensure regional stability.

The piece presents a collection of direct quotes calling for the destruction of infrastructure, elimination of the population, and the flattening of the territory. The author argues that these statements, many broadcast on mainstream channels like Israel's Channel 14, show a pattern of rhetoric that blurs the line between Hamas and civilians.

Critics argue that housing people in the extreme heat and humidity of a Florida summer, in an area with alligators and pythons, is inhumane.

While top officials assert the strikes severely damaged Iran's program, some Democrats who received a classified briefing remain skeptical of these claims. The resolution faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Senate, but it forces a debate on Congress's constitutional power to declare war.</p>

          <p>The legal landscape surrounding AI and copyright infringement has grown murkier following two recent federal court rulings. In one case, a judge ruled that training AI models on copyrighted works is "transformative" and constitutes fair use, a win for AI firms, but also found the defendant, Anthropic, liable for using pirated books. In another case against Meta, a different judge suggested training models on copyrighted works is likely illegal but ruled for Meta because the plaintiffs failed to argue a key point.

          <p>Bruce Springsteen has released "Tracks II: The Lost Albums," a massive 83-song box set of unreleased material that is being hailed as a significant work of pop archiving. The collection organizes the songs into seven distinct "lost albums" from the 1980s and 1990s, revealing experimental and contemplative sides of the artist during his peak fame. The review suggests the project aims to reshape Springsteen's lore, showing his ambivalence about stardom and his creative restlessness during the '90s.

          <p>A review of Charlie English's new book, "The CIA Book Club," praises it as a thrilling account of how literature was used as a weapon during the Cold War. The book focuses primarily on Poland's decades-long fight against Soviet domination, detailing how the CIA funded the smuggling of forbidden books like George Orwell's "1984" behind the Iron Curtain. The reviewer finds the story reads like a spy novel, filled with heroes, traitors, and high-stakes cultural resistance. While the book excels at documenting the Polish underground movement, the review notes it could have explored the program's impact in other Eastern Bloc countries more broadly.</p>

The incident has sparked outrage and raised questions about the aggressive tactics and risks associated with the Trump administration's at-large immigration arrests.

The article argues that the Democratic party is experiencing its own version of the Tea Party moment, where outsider candidates who challenge the status quo are gaining traction.

The author contends that this policy is not isolationist but rather a pragmatic, Jacksonian approach that avoids nation-building while remaining willing to use force to defend core U.S. interests. The piece asserts that the strike, which devastated Iran's nuclear program without American casualties, was a great act of statesmanship.

The price hike for domestic rice is partly due to a supply shortage.

The final attendance for the event was reported to be approximately 198,000 people.</p>

          <p>Chinese electronics company Anker Innovations has formed a strategic partnership with battery maker Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), a key supplier for Apple. The move comes after Anker, along with a rival, recalled over 1.2 million power banks due to fire risks from defective battery cells provided by a previous supplier. Anker plans an initial purchase of 45 million lithium-ion batteries from ATL as it works to secure its supply chain and restore consumer confidence in its product safety. The company has ceased doing business with the supplier linked to the defective cells.</p>

          <p>The German government has voted to suspend family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for at least the next two years. This status is granted to individuals who don't qualify as refugees under the Geneva Convention but face serious harm in their home country. The decision affects around 351,400 people, mostly from Syria, who now have no legal route to bring their spouses or children to Germany. The government cited the country's limited capacity to integrate newcomers, while human rights groups criticized the move for the immense psychological strain it places on separated families.</p>

          <p>China has expelled the People's Liberation Army Navy's chief of staff, Vice Admiral Li Hanjun, and a top nuclear scientist, Liu Shipeng, from the National People's Congress. The move is the latest development in a wide-ranging anti-corruption crackdown targeting China's military and defense industry leadership. The dismissals were announced by the NPC Standing Committee and follow a pattern of high-profile generals and executives being implicated in the ongoing purge. This action signals a continued effort by the state to assert control and root out corruption within its most powerful institutions.</p>

          <p>Japan has executed Takahiro Shiraishi, a man convicted of murdering nine people in 2017 after contacting them on social media. This marks the country's first execution since July 2022. Shiraishi, dubbed the "Twitter killer," was found guilty of murdering, dismembering, and storing the bodies of his victims, who had expressed suicidal thoughts online. The execution comes amid renewed debate over Japan's use of capital punishment, particularly following the recent exoneration of a man who spent over four decades on death row. Despite international pressure, government polls show that over 80 percent of the Japanese public supports the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, rising for a fourth consecutive day. The market rally was fueled by easing concerns over steep U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Investors reacted positively to news that the U.S. may extend a pause on tariffs against China, which helped boost heavyweight technology and transportation equipment stocks. The broader Topix index also finished higher, reflecting widespread optimism in the market as immediate trade war fears appeared to recede. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to publish a new rule that eliminates the 30-day warning period before levying fines on undocumented immigrants in the United States. Under the new process, the government can immediately begin issuing fines of up to $1,000 per day for violations such as failing to depart after a removal order. This policy applies to those who enter illegally or ignore judicial orders to leave the country. The administration stated the move is intended to create consequences for breaking immigration laws, while also noting that fines will be waived for those who use the CBP Home app to self-deport.</p>
