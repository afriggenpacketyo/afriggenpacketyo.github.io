            <p>Zhao Chunling, a female engineer from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), is leading China's effort to rival Boeing and Airbus in the widebody airliner market with the C929 program. Zhao, who previously contributed to the C909 and C919 projects, has been the lead designer since 2023, aiming to close the gap with the Western duopoly. Despite NPU being subject to US sanctions due to its military ties, Zhao's work signifies China's ambition to achieve self-sufficiency in advanced aviation technology. Her career path reflects China's broader technological aspirations and its efforts to overcome international restrictions.</p>

            <p>Guudey Mohamed Geedi, an actor in the Somali film "Aano Qabiil" (Clan Vengeance), which warns against the futility of clan revenge killings, was shot dead in a family feud. The film, intended to educate about the devastation caused by clan rivalries, has gone viral after Geedi's death mirrored the violence depicted in the drama. Clan identity is deeply ingrained in Somali society, and clan-related killings contribute to internal conflicts and displacement, especially in rural areas. The film's director hopes that Geedi's death will further spread the film's message that revenge does not bring resolution.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily halted an effort to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by defying a court order to turn around deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The lower court found probable cause that the administration acted in contempt, but the appeals court's order does not rule on the merits of the inquiry. The Supreme Court previously ruled that the Trump administration could resume deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, but the lower court argued the administration defied the order while it was in effect.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the US bond market after a rare surge in government bond yields, signaling a loss of confidence in the American economy due to trade tariffs. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs' impact has made investors demand higher returns for buying US bonds. This could lead to increased borrowing costs for the government, businesses, and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth. The bond market's reaction prompted President Trump to pause higher tariffs, highlighting its influence on policy decisions (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen reported that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was "traumatized" at CECOT, a Salvadoran supermax prison, after meeting with him in El Salvador. Abrego Garcia was deported due to an administrative error and has since been moved to another prison where the conditions are better. Van Hollen faced challenges trying to meet with Abrego Garcia, but ultimately shared a photo of their meeting. The Trump administration continues to claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the transnational MS-13 gang, a claim his attorney and family have denied.</p>

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham, UK, has exposed the divide between rich and poor, with waste piling up in densely populated, inner-city areas while wealthier parts of the city experience fewer problems. The strike, now in its sixth week, has led to concerns about rat infestations and public health. Residents express frustration over what they perceive as a two-tiered waste collection system, with poorer areas receiving less frequent service even before the strike began. The council acknowledges the problems and commits to improvement once the strike is resolved.</p>

            <p>The ACLU warns that immigration authorities are moving to quickly restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act despite the U.S. Supreme Court's restrictions on how it can use the act. A group of Venezuelans detained in a Texas facility was advised that they would be immediately deported under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th-century wartime law that allows for accelerated removal of foreigners deemed a threat by authorities. The ACLU is asking that migrants being subjected to the Alien Enemies Act be given at least 30 days advance notice.</p>
