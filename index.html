        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May year-over-year, the most significant drop since last October, signaling that government stimulus measures are not fully revitalizing corporate earnings. The decline is attributed to weak domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods, with the automotive and mining sectors seeing substantial profit decreases. Despite this, some economists believe the worst may be over for manufacturers' profit margins and do not expect immediate, large-scale stimulus from Beijing, given other mixed but partially positive economic indicators.

While not naming former President Trump, his comments followed a pattern of attacks on the judiciary, and Kennedy stressed the critical need to protect judges and their families from threats to uphold the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Lynne Tracy, the first woman to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Russia, is concluding her tenure in Moscow after navigating one of the most difficult periods in U.S.-Russia relations.

          <p>A Japanese court has handed down a three-year suspended prison sentence to Yoo Ju Hyun, a 23-year-old South Korean student, for injuring eight people in a hammer attack at Hosei University.

While noting the dangerous nature of the attacks, the court's ruling took her mental state into account. Yoo had claimed she was bullied by other students, though the court found no evidence the victims were involved.</p>

These covert releases are illegal without a license, and the activists risk arrest and fines, but they argue the official reintroduction process is too bureaucratic to address the urgent climate and biodiversity crisis. While the activists tout the environmental benefits of beavers, such as flood mitigation and water purification, the National Farmers Union expresses concern over the irresponsible nature of unlicensed releases and their potential negative impact on farmland.</p>

This demand was reportedly driven by consumer concerns about potential price hikes resulting from high tariffs imposed by the U.S. government.
