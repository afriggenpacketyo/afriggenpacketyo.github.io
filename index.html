          <p>Millions of Afghan refugees in Iran, some of whom have lived there for decades, are facing a heightened risk of deportation back to Afghanistan. A recent UN report indicates that 1.35 million refugees have been forced to leave Iran in recent months, many through arbitrary arrests and forced removals. Activists and human rights groups are protesting the crackdown, citing inhumane conditions and racist attitudes fueled by negative media coverage that blames refugees for economic problems. The mass deportations are overwhelming humanitarian services in western Afghanistan, where returnees arrive with no shelter, work, or future prospects.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber has refuted claims that the institution is considering a $500 million settlement to resolve a dispute with the Trump administration over frozen federal funding. Garber informed faculty that Harvard intends to address the conflict through the legal system, not a large financial deal. The dispute stems from allegations of antisemitism on campus, which led the administration to halt federal funds. While Harvard has made some concessions, such as eliminating diversity offices, it is currently fighting in court to restore research funding and challenge a ban on international student enrollment.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic move, Democratic state legislators have left Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map is designed to significantly increase the GOP's advantage in the state's U.S. House delegation. Democrats accuse Governor Greg Abbott of using disaster relief for recent floods as political leverage for what they call a "Trump gerrymander." In response, Governor Abbott has threatened to invoke a legal opinion to remove the absent lawmakers from office, escalating the political showdown over redistricting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) have become an attractive option for savers, with top accounts offering rates that exceed the current inflation rate. This article outlines current national average CD yields and contrasts them with significantly higher rates available from online banks, which have lower overhead costs. It advises consumers to consider shorter-term CDs, as an inverted yield curve has resulted in higher rates for terms like six months to one year. To maximize returns, experts suggest comparing offers from various online institutions and considering a laddering strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As investor interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grows, with assets now exceeding $13 trillion, financial experts emphasize the importance of having a clear investment strategy. ETFs offer flexibility and lower costs compared to mutual funds, but advisors warn against impulsive trading. They suggest trading during the middle of the day, between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. ET, to avoid the higher volatility often seen at market open and close. The article also explains the use of limit orders to control purchase prices, while cautioning against trying to perfectly time the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the elected Police and Crime Commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to join Reform UK. This move gives Nigel Farage's party its first-ever police and crime commissioner, a significant local government milestone. At a press conference with Farage, Matthews stated that the "dark heart of wokeness" needed to be removed from the justice system and that establishment politicians have failed the country. The defection is seen as a sign of the Conservative Party's fraying local base and the growing energy on the right of British politics with Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced plans to model new state-run migrant detention centers on the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" facility in Florida. Noem stated that she is in discussions with governors to establish similar sites in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana, prioritizing locations near airports for efficient processing and deportation. The strategy aims to expand ICE's detention capacity using a new $45 billion funding pool, shifting away from long-term contracts with private prison companies. The plan has faced legal challenges and criticism over inhumane conditions and the legality of state-run immigration detention.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists is studying the oldest continuous ice core ever drilled, a 1.2-million-year-old sample from Antarctica, to uncover secrets about Earth's climate history. The core contains trapped air bubbles that allow researchers to measure atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations over millennia. Scientists hope the data will help explain a major climate shift that occurred around one million years ago, when ice age cycles changed from every 40,000 years to every 100,000 years. Understanding this transition could improve predictions of how Earth will respond to current and future human-driven climate change.</p>

This move follows a warning from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev about a potential war with the U.S. and references to Russia's automated nuclear retaliation system. The deployment precedes a visit by a U.S. special envoy to Moscow and a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine.

The bill raises the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 but phases it out for those with a modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000, creating an effective 45.5% federal tax rate within that range.

          <p>A new report in the Lancet medical journal describes plastic pollution as a grave and growing danger to human health, with economic costs exceeding $1.5 trillion per year. The review of existing research links chemicals in plastics to a wide range of health problems at all life stages, including impaired reproduction, diminished cognitive function, and increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Researchers highlighted the particular vulnerability of infants and young children. The report's authors are calling for a strong, legally binding international treaty to address the crisis as global plastic production is projected to triple by 2060.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 workers at Boeing's defense unit have gone on strike for the first time in nearly three decades after rejecting a contract offer from the company. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted down a proposal that included a 20% wage increase and a ratification bonus, demanding a contract that better reflects their skills and role in national defense. The striking employees are responsible for assembling and maintaining critical military hardware, including F-15 fighter jets and missile systems. The work stoppage affects a unit that contributes significantly to Boeing's overall revenue.</p>

          <p>A musical advertisement from cryptocurrency firm Coinbase has ignited a national conversation in the U.K. by satirizing the country's economic woes, including strikes and a cost-of-living crisis. The ad, titled "Everything is Fine," was praised by many in the tech and finance sectors who agreed with its critical premise but was also divisive among the general public. The ad drew commentary from political figures like Nigel Farage and former Chancellor George Osborne, who is on Coinbase's advisory council. Coinbase's CEO stated the ad's message is about updating a failing financial system, not a specific critique of the government.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK car buyers who used financing over the last 18 years could be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on undisclosed commissions. The court found that some dealers charged excessive fees or failed to properly disclose them, meaning customers who were treated unfairly should be compensated. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation scheme, with payments expected in 2026. The ruling specifically targets discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), which were banned in 2021 but previously allowed dealers to set higher interest rates to earn more commission.</p>

The zoo assures that donated animals are gently euthanized by trained staff before being used as fodder. This practice, while controversial, is defended by the zoo as a responsible part of managing captive predators.</p>

The proposal is part of Reform UK's broader campaign focused on law and order, which claims that Britain has become lawless.
