        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range despite external pressure to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of lower rates, signaling a potential shift in future policy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited ongoing concerns about inflation remaining above the 2% target and a moderately growing economy as reasons for the cautious approach. The central bank will continue to monitor economic data, including the effects of tariffs, before its next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a comprehensive trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on South Korean exports to the U.S., a reduction from a previously threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea has committed to a $350 billion investment fund for U.S.-controlled projects and a $100 billion purchase of American energy products. However, differing interpretations have emerged regarding the management and profit distribution of the investment fund, a point of contention also seen in a recent U.S. deal with Japan.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a substantial drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling by more than half compared to the previous year and missing analyst expectations. The decline is primarily attributed to a major slump in its memory chip business, which saw profits plummet due to inventory adjustments and export restriction impacts. While the company's mobile division showed positive growth driven by sales of its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones, the overall results were heavily weighed down by the struggling semiconductor unit. Samsung plans to focus on high-demand AI-driven products to improve performance. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's guidance for the third quarter was also incredibly strong, further boosting investor confidence despite a raised outlook for full-year expenses and capital expenditures. The impressive results were driven by strong user engagement across its Family of Apps and significant growth in ad impressions and pricing, bolstered by advancements in its AI recommendation systems.

          <p>A group of twelve Democratic members of Congress has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is illegally restricting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. The complaint argues that the Department of Homeland Security is violating federal law that guarantees congressional members access to these facilities for oversight purposes. This legal action follows several reported incidents where lawmakers were denied entry or faced delays when attempting to inspect conditions. The administration maintains that it now requires a week's notice for such visits to prevent interference with executive branch functions.</p>

A source described Ricchetti as "combative and defensive," asserting that Biden was fully capable of performing his presidential duties, although acknowledging his age was a political concern. Ricchetti is the latest of several former Biden aides to be interviewed in the ongoing probe, which is examining the use of autopens for executive actions.</p>

          <p>Using a recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast as a case study, this article explains the science of how tsunamis are generated, propagated, and predicted. A tsunami typically requires a powerful underwater earthquake, usually magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes vertical displacement of the seafloor, which is what occurred in the Pacific's Ring of Fire. Scientists use tide gauges and deep-ocean pressure sensors to forecast wave height and timing, though it remains a complex challenge. For safety, experts advise immediately moving to higher ground—at least 30 to 100 feet above sea level—upon receiving a tsunami warning, as the waves are immensely powerful.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed vast beds of clams, bacterial mats, and fields of tube worms, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme pressure and darkness. These ecosystems are chemosynthetic, meaning they are fueled by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust rather than sunlight. The findings suggest such deep-sea communities may be more widespread than previously thought, opening new avenues for research into extreme adaptation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a 3% annualized growth rate in the second quarter, a significant rebound after shrinking in the first three months of the year. This stronger-than-expected performance was largely driven by a sharp decline in imports, a statistical quirk tied to the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, which are subtracted from the GDP calculation. While consumer spending also increased, a key underlying measure of private domestic demand showed much weaker growth of only 1.2%, suggesting that the economy's fundamental strength may be less robust than the headline figure indicates.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to explain why it has not complied with previous orders to restore the operations of Voice of America (VOA), the U.S. government-funded news agency. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth accused the administration of ignoring his directives and potentially trying to "run out the clock" on the fiscal year to waste the $260 million appropriated by Congress. The agency has been largely non-operational since March, following the appointment of a new adviser who oversaw the dismissal of a majority of its staff in an effort to dismantle what was called a "bloated bureaucracy."</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin, in which he alleged malicious prosecution by state officials regarding the fatal 2021 shooting on the "Rust" film set. Baldwin filed the suit after the involuntary manslaughter charge against him was dropped last year due to prosecutors withholding potential evidence. The new ruling dismisses his civil claims against prosecutors and sheriff's deputies, citing a lack of significant action in the case for six months. This decision comes as legal proceedings related to the incident are concluding, including the recent prison release of the film's weapons handler.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing popularity of anxiety-inducing television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," which immerse viewers in high-pressure, realistic environments. In contrast to escapist "comfort TV," these series use techniques like real-time pacing and single-take sequences to create a visceral sense of tension that resonates with audiences. Psychologists suggest this appeal may stem from "vicarious stress," a risk-free fight-or-flight response, and the catharsis of seeing relatable characters navigate mundane yet high-stakes workplace challenges. This trend reflects a potential shift in viewer appetite towards realism and stories that mirror the constant, low-level anxiety of modern life.</p>

Doron Katz-Asher, who was captured on October 7 and later released, stated that such a move sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy and could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages. Her comments echo concerns from lawyers representing British families of hostages, who fear the conditional nature of the UK's proposal might lead Hamas to refuse a ceasefire.

This is the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting apologies from the firm and calls for an investigation from political leaders.

          <p>A new analysis suggests that recent U.S. legislation prioritizing fossil fuels and nuclear power over renewables could allow China to dominate the global clean energy market. Supporters of the U.S. policy argue it is a necessary step for energy independence, aiming to reduce reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains for critical minerals and renewable technologies. However, critics contend that this short-term focus on security risks long-term U.S. competitiveness in the green transition. The strategic shift could leave the U.S. vulnerable to geopolitical manipulation by Beijing and potentially hinder global efforts to combat climate change.</p>

The map consolidates Democratic districts in Austin and redraws boundaries in Houston and south Texas to favor GOP candidates.
