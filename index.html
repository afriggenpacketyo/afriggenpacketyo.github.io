            <p>A public feud erupted between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, with Navarro claiming Tesla is merely a car assembler relying on foreign parts. Musk refuted this, asserting that Tesla has the most American-made cars and is significantly more vertically integrated than other automakers. Fact-checks support Musk's claim, noting Tesla's in-house battery production and lithium refinery. While tariffs could disrupt the auto industry, analysts predict Tesla will be less affected than its rivals.</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC suggests that the stock market is struggling to react to President Trump's rapidly changing statements and policies. The market experienced a volatile day, initially soaring before plummeting into the red, driven by speculation about tariff negotiations. Cramer argues that the short-term outlook is bleak due to the uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies. The market's erratic behavior reflects the lack of confidence among investors, who are awaiting a more consistent approach from the White House. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>This article discusses the contrast between President Trump's emphasis on due process for himself and his administration's efforts to limit it for others. The Supreme Court's rulings on deportation cases and the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia highlight this disparity. While Trump has benefited from due process protections to delay legal proceedings against him, his administration seeks to restrict these rights for immigrants. The article questions whether everyone will continue to enjoy the same constitutional protections.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies continue to cause diplomatic and trade confusion, with the announcement of additional tariffs on Chinese imports following a day of geopolitical swings. Despite initially appearing conciliatory towards Beijing, the White House later confirmed that tariffs would increase. Economists warn that Trump's program risks fueling inflation and triggering a destructive global trade war. The administration's rapid shifts are viewed as inconsistent and unlikely to achieve its stated goals.</p>

While Sheinbaum has agreed to increased surveillance flights, military strikes would likely damage U.S.-Mexico relations.</p>

            <p>New Social Security rules will make it harder for millions of seniors to access retirement and survivor benefits, as phone applications will no longer be accepted. Applicants must now apply online or visit a Social Security field office, which could require some seniors to travel up to 45 miles. Advocates argue that these changes create barriers to services, particularly for those in rural areas or with disabilities. Officials claim the measures are intended to safeguard against fraudulent activity.</p>
