          <p>Former President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of the U.S.-India trade relationship following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In a social media post, Trump labeled the trade ties a "totally one sided disaster," citing high Indian tariffs on U.S. goods and India's continued purchase of oil and arms from Russia. This statement comes amid souring relations and after the U.S. imposed significant tariffs on India, including secondary duties for its Russian oil imports. The article provides context on the tariff rates and the failure to reach a bilateral trade deal earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving member of the U.S. House from New York, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. In an interview, the 78-year-old congressman cited the "necessity for generational change" within the Democratic party as a primary motivation for his decision. Nadler, who has served since 1992 and chaired the powerful House Judiciary Committee during Donald Trump's first impeachment, stated he believes a younger successor could better address the political challenges facing the nation. His announcement was met with praise from colleagues, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has suggested that new, improved versions of the YJ-21 and DF-17 hypersonic missiles could be featured in the upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing. A military commentator on the state broadcaster CCTV specifically highlighted a potential air-launched variant of the YJ-21, which would significantly enhance its strategic value by allowing it to be deployed from bombers outside enemy air defense zones. This development points toward China's strategy of creating a versatile family of land-, sea-, and air-launched hypersonic weapons, thereby increasing its military's offensive penetration capabilities.</p>

          <p>A nearly 50-year-old mystery surrounding the disappearance of revered Lebanese Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr may be close to a solution. A BBC investigation used advanced facial recognition technology to analyze a 2011 photograph of a corpse found in a secret Libyan mortuary, finding a high probability that it is Sadr. The cleric vanished in 1978 after traveling to Libya to meet with then-leader Muammar Gaddafi, and his fate has been the subject of intense speculation ever since. The findings suggest Sadr was likely killed, potentially altering historical narratives about political dynamics in the Middle East on the eve of the Iranian Revolution.</p>

          <p>A recent study has uncovered a surprising mathematical order within the planet's geological timeline, suggesting that major events like mass extinctions and evolutionary bursts are not random. Researchers found that the boundaries between geological periods in the Phanerozoic Eon follow a multifractal pattern, forming hierarchical clusters separated by long periods of stability. This discovery challenges the view of Earth's history as chaotic, indicating a deeply structured system. The findings imply that understanding the full range of Earth's potential changes, including future upheavals, requires analyzing geological records spanning at least half a billion years.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that modern Western nations, particularly Britain, are beginning to exhibit characteristics reminiscent of the Soviet Union in its final years. The author suggests that a managerial class, coupled with widespread political rigidity and a fear of questioning established dogmas, mirrors the societal stagnation that preceded the USSR's collapse. While acknowledging that history is unpredictable, the article posits that these parallels warrant serious consideration. The commentary warns that even a decline, short of a full collapse, of Western influence could have profound consequences for the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>Global food giant Nestle has dismissed its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation confirmed he had failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The inquiry was reportedly initiated through the company's whistleblowing channel and was overseen by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. In a statement, the company emphasized that the decision was necessary to uphold its strong values and governance principles. Freixe, who had been with Nestle for nearly 40 years and CEO for one, will not receive an exit package.</p>

          <p>China is advancing a proposal to create a new development bank to serve the 10 member nations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), including Russia and India. Analysts suggest the institution would aim to insulate member economies from risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global trade system and finance key infrastructure projects. The plan, which has been discussed for years, gained momentum at a recent SCO summit. This move is part of a broader strategy by Beijing and its partners to establish alternative financial structures that reduce their reliance on Western-led institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The decision, revealed two days after Giuliani was seriously injured in a car crash, honors a figure known for his leadership of New York City after 9/11 but also for his controversial role as Trump's lawyer. Giuliani faced disbarment and criminal charges for his efforts to amplify false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Trump praised Giuliani as the "greatest Mayor" in New York City's history and a "great American Patriot."</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to at least 286,000 years old. This places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and provides crucial insights into human evolution in Europe. The dating, achieved through advanced uranium-series techniques, strengthens the theory that the skull belongs to Homo heidelbergensis or a related archaic human population. This suggests that these more primitive humans coexisted in southeastern Europe alongside the emerging Neanderthal lineage, painting a more complex and branched picture of our evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>The aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, may be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days, according to the Met Office. A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun has heightened solar activity, creating a "decent chance" for the phenomenon to be seen much farther south than usual. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, forecasters suggest that Monday and Tuesday nights offer the best opportunity for a rare and memorable display. The Midlands may have the clearest skies, providing a prime viewing location.</p>

While his performance level has improved with each round, his ability to compete at his peak against top opponents like his next challenger, Taylor Fritz, will depend heavily on his body holding up.</p>

          <p>Despite repeated threats to punish Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine, former President Donald Trump has held back from implementing severe new sanctions. According to analysts, this hesitation is driven by two key strategic factors. First is Trump's desire to position himself as a global peacemaker who can broker a deal between the two sides. Second, there are concerns within Washington that isolating Russia completely would push it into a deeper, more formal alliance with China, which could strengthen Beijing's global position and grant it greater access to resources and military technology.</p>
