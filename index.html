          <p>The Powerball lottery drawing for Saturday night's estimated $1 billion jackpot has concluded, revealing the winning numbers as 3, 18, 22, 27, 33, with a Powerball of 17. This massive prize, boasting an estimated cash value of $453.1 million, represents the sixth time in the game's 33-year history that the top prize has soared to the billion-dollar mark. Since no one has won Powerball's jackpot since May 31, when a California ticket claimed $204.5 million, the anticipation continues to build. With no grand prize winner this Saturday, the jackpot will further increase for the next drawing on Monday at 11 p.m. ET, drawing even more hopeful participants.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed a comprehensive executive order, the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," aiming to safeguard residents' rights amidst growing concerns of federal agents possibly arriving for a major immigration enforcement effort. The order explicitly seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks and mandates them to display identifying information, while also prohibiting city police from collaborating on federal immigration enforcement or traffic stops. Johnson declared the city would utilize all available legal and legislative avenues to oppose federal actions that infringe upon the constitutional rights of Chicagoans. This article underscores the escalating political tension between the city and the Trump administration over federal intervention in local affairs.</p>

          <p>Iowa Hawkeyes coach Kirk Ferentz achieved a historic milestone, tying Ohio State's Woody Hayes as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach with his 205th victory for the program. The Hawkeyes defeated Albany 34-7, a game where Xavier Williams rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown, despite a somewhat sluggish debut from transfer quarterback Mark Gronowski. Ferentz, now in his 27th season as Iowa's coach and the longest-tenured active head coach in college football, humbly downplayed the personal achievement, focusing instead on the team's successful opening performance. This article celebrates a coaching legend's enduring success and his team's strong start to the season.</p>

Guglielmelli's associate, Rick Fuhrmann, instead exposed the scheme to authorities, leading to a sting operation where Dino was recorded confirming his intent to have Monica killed for $80,000. Monica had previously faced false domestic violence charges from Dino, a pattern mirroring his first divorce, indicating a calculated effort to gain custody and control. Guglielmelli ultimately pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, serving six years, while Monica and Fuhrmann remain concerned about his potential vengeful actions post-release.</p>

While he also advocates for paper ballots over electronic machines, the constitutional power of a president to enact such federal election measures, which are traditionally state-administered, remains a significant legal question.

The comprehensive strategy has reportedly led to the eradication of the beetle from at-risk areas in eastern and southeastern England.

          <h2>California Bill Mandating Removal of Unused Power Lines for Wildfire Prevention Fails in Legislature</h2>

          <p>A California state bill, SB 256, aimed at requiring investor-owned utilities like Southern California Edison to remove decommissioned power lines to prevent catastrophic wildfires, unexpectedly failed in Sacramento. Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, whose district was devastated by the Eaton fire, championed the bill, citing concerns that an idle transmission line may have been the blaze's ignition site, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. Despite utilities formally withdrawing their opposition in recent weeks, Pérez expressed profound frustration, suggesting that "shadow lobbying" might have contributed to the bill's failure to advance. This article highlights the ongoing struggle for accountability and proactive measures in mitigating California's persistent wildfire risks.</p>

          <p>The temporary South Florida Detention Facility, controversially dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" due to its Everglades location, is being shut down two months after opening, complying with a judge's order amidst allegations of inhumane conditions. This article highlights the facility's role as a polarising symbol of President Trump's immigration policy, with conflicting reports on its conditions from visiting lawmakers. Families of detainees, such as Michael Borrego Fernandez, allege severe medical neglect and lack of confidential legal access, prompting an ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration. Despite the closure, other temporary facilities are being planned in Republican-led states, indicating a continued focus on expanding immigration detention infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US body broker industry, where private companies acquire, dissect, and sell human body parts for profit, is facing intense criticism for its lack of regulation and potential for exploitation. Unlike many European countries, US law permits charging "reasonable amounts" for "processing" body parts, leading to a flourishing, largely unregulated trade that has turned the US into a global exporter of cadavers. This article highlights tragic cases, such as Harold Dillard's family discovering his body was "mutilated" and concerns about "bodies of the state" donations without proper next-of-kin notification. Critics advocate for stronger regulation, a ban on for-profit brokering, and increased altruistic donations to prevent abuses in this ethically complex industry.</p>

          <p>New government data in England suggests that pupils who are partially absent during the first week back in September are significantly more likely to become "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school, throughout the rest of the year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged parents and schools to "double down" on efforts to ensure full attendance at the start of term, emphasizing its critical role in boosting the life chances of young people. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains a greater problem than pre-Covid levels, with about 18% of pupils persistently absent in the 2024-25 school year. This article highlights the importance of early engagement and ongoing support, including new attendance and behavior hubs, to tackle the persistent challenge of school absence.</p>

          <p>The article suggests that Indonesia's leader, Prabowo, is poised to offer a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy, termed "constructive pragmatism," as the world grapples with a dysfunctional international system. Indonesia's extensive relationships, status as an economic powerhouse, and unaligned position between competing ideologies enable it to bridge divides and foster cooperation. This unique standing, coupled with the growing influence of middle powers, positions Prabowo's message as a potential blueprint for prioritizing cooperation over confrontation in a fragmented world.
