          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) is still struggling to resolve a significant cyber attack that has disrupted online ordering systems, deliveries, and internal platforms for over a week, costing the retailer millions. The firm is working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the Information Commissioner's Office to investigate the incident, but details remain scarce, raising questions about the prolonged resolution time. Cybersecurity experts emphasize the complexity of addressing malware on the scale of M&S's systems, suggesting that complete recovery will require considerable time and expertise to ensure the hacker's expulsion. The company took the decision to pause online orders on Friday as it continued to deal with the impact of the cyber attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles expects a 35% drop in shipping volume next week compared to last year due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, leading retailers to halt shipments from China. Executive director Gene Seroka anticipates roughly a quarter of the usual number of ships to be canceled in May. Economists warn of potential layoffs in transportation and retail industries, empty shelves, and a possible recession this summer. Seroka believes U.S. retailers have a few weeks before the impact is felt, but consumers may soon see less variety and higher prices on store shelves.</p>

          <p>PayPal reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, although revenue missed estimates and the company reaffirmed its 2025 guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainty. While sales increased just 1% from a year earlier, PayPal said the results reflect a strategy to prioritize profitability over volume, rolling off lower-margin revenue streams. Total payment volume missed estimates, but the number of active accounts rose 2% from a year earlier to 436 million. For the second quarter, PayPal issued better-than-expected guidance, forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.31, above the average analyst estimate of $1.21.

          <p>House Education and Workforce Committee Republicans have unveiled a plan to overhaul the student loan and financial aid system, proposing limits on student borrowing and a reduction in repayment options. The Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan aims to support President Trump's tax cuts. Consumer advocates have warned that the proposed measures would worsen the affordability crisis families face in paying for college. The plan includes proposals that would restrict college access by slashing financial aid programs, eliminating basic consumer protections and making it harder to repay student loan debt.</p>
