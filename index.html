          <p>Spirit Airlines' parent company, Spirit Aviation Holdings, issued a stark warning about its ability to continue operations, causing its stock to plummet by 39%. The budget carrier cited "adverse market conditions," including weak domestic travel demand, just months after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite cost-cutting measures like pilot furloughs, the airline stated it needs more liquidity and may sell aircraft and real estate to survive. The company has struggled with over $2.5 billion in losses since 2020 due to rising costs and debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting follows a recent call where Zelenskyy noted a "signal" from a White House adviser suggesting Russia might be ready for ceasefire talks, a development he viewed with cautious optimism. However, Zelenskyy also expressed concern that Putin is preparing for new military offensives despite the upcoming peace summit in Alaska. He reiterated that Ukraine will not cede territory or abandon its NATO aspirations in any potential deal.</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) and peaking at 33.4°C in several locations. The sustained hot, dry weather has led to "nationally significant" water shortfalls, impacting farms, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risks. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts, and the conditions have disrupted rail services due to shrinking soil under tracks. Experts warn that climate change is making such extreme weather events more frequent and intense.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the latest Consumer Price Index report showing inflation holding steady at 2.7%, financial experts argue that pursuing debt forgiveness remains a sensible strategy for many Americans. The core issue is that credit card interest rates are still at historic highs, averaging around 22%, which far outpaces the rate of inflation. Holding onto high-interest debt while waiting for potential economic improvements carries a significant opportunity cost. This article suggests that the current stable environment might be an optimal time to aggressively tackle debt before potential future economic headwinds arise. (not investment advice)</p>

While opening the bottle after a show, the glass top snapped off and severely cut her thumb, leading to a trip to the emergency room in an ambulance.

          <p>Buck Owens' Crystal Palace, an iconic country music venue and restaurant in Bakersfield, California, has suddenly closed its doors after 28 years. The establishment, founded by the country music legend, was a temple for the "Bakersfield Sound" and hosted countless stars like Garth Brooks and Taylor Swift. The Buck Owens Private Foundation, which has owned the venue since Owens' death, cited the pandemic, a slowing economy, and the challenges of the restaurant business as reasons for the closure. The news has prompted an outpouring of grief from fans, with many hoping a wealthy benefactor will save the historic venue.</p>

The revision came after second-quarter same-store sales rose only 2.1%, significantly missing Wall Street's expectation of 6.1% growth. The company attributed the slowdown to lapping the successful launch of its grilled steak option from the previous year, a trend of slowing sales seen across the fast-casual sector.

The freeze affects hundreds of research grants from agencies like the NSF and NIH, funding critical work in areas like cancer and brain science.

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between guaranteed rates and potentially higher, but variable, returns. This article breaks down the potential earnings, showing that for short terms like three months, a high-yield savings account might currently earn slightly more. However, for longer terms of six months to a year, the fixed rate of a CD often provides a better and more predictable return. The decision depends on the saver's risk tolerance and time horizon, especially with potential future interest rate cuts looming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A homicide investigation is underway in Sumter County, South Carolina, after a landowner discovered the bodies of two women in a clearing on his property. The victims were identified as Kristen Grissom, 38, and Christine Marie McAbee, 35. An autopsy revealed McAbee died from a gunshot wound, and authorities believe the women were killed elsewhere before being moved to the location. The two women knew each other, and officials have stated the incident appears to be isolated with no ongoing threat to the public.

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, has been rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote Canadian wilderness of British Columbia. Barber survived by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a shelter from moss and sticks. Demonstrating resourcefulness, he carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which aided in his discovery. A search and rescue helicopter spotted his truck and then found him nearby, severely dehydrated and with a leg injury. Rescuers noted that despite his survival skills, he was lucky to have been found when he was.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index for July remained unchanged from the previous month at 2.7% year-over-year, aided by falling gasoline and grocery prices. However, economists point to concerning signs beneath the surface, as the "core" inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, climbed to 3.1%. Experts suggest that the effects of the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are beginning to appear in the data, particularly in the prices of goods like household furnishings. They warn that these inflationary pressures are likely to become more pronounced in the coming months as higher import costs are fully passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>Germany is reportedly planning a multi-billion dollar investment in Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft gun system to address the growing threat from drones. This move marks a significant reinvestment in short-range air defense (SHORAD), a capability largely dismantled after the Cold War. The conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the effectiveness of such systems, like the older Gepard guns, against modern threats. The new Skyranger 30, mounted on an armored vehicle, features a 30mm cannon with advanced airburst ammunition and can be supplemented with missiles, providing a modern solution to protect both troops and critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Officials in Juneau, Alaska, have urged some residents to evacuate as a glacial lake outburst from the Mendenhall Glacier threatens record flooding. An ice dam on the glacier, which holds back a basin of rainwater and snowmelt, has begun to release its contents into the Mendenhall River. The National Weather Service predicts a record crest, potentially damaging hundreds of homes in the flood zone. This has become a recurring summer event, with last year's flood causing significant damage, and the problem is expected to persist for decades as the glacier continues to retreat.</p>

The plan, presented to lawmakers, aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by allowing businesses to import components and brand the final products as "Made in Paraguay." Officials see this as an opportunity to become an attractive assembly hub, capitalizing on global trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods.

This review, which will scrutinize everything from exhibit text to curatorial processes, follows a presidential order to celebrate "American exceptionalism."
