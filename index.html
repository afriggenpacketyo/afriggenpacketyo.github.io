          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse against nine children. The victims, aged 7 to 16, were allegedly subjected to horrific conditions, including being kept in plywood cages under bunk beds and punished by being sprayed with vinegar. Investigators found that the four adopted children were treated unfairly compared to the biological children and were ordered to lie about the abuse. All nine children have since been removed from the home.</p>

          <p>Recent remarks by a Chinese provincial official have reignited historical sensitivities between China and South Korea. The party chief of Jilin province called for a clear presentation of the history of the ancient Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms as Chinese history, which are known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae. This contested view of the kingdoms, which existed in northeastern China and the Korean peninsula, is a recurring point of diplomatic friction. The official's comments underscore the ongoing debate over historical narratives in the region.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government appears to be increasingly censoring information about mass attacks, such as those involving vehicles or knives, to prevent unrest and potential copycat crimes. This shift in information control, which intensified after a particularly deadly incident in November, has led to authorities releasing minimal details or scrubbing reports from the internet. The article notes that this suppression has prompted some citizens to push back online, demanding more transparency from local officials about these violent events.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that threatens to permanently divide the war-torn nation. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and escalates the country's 27-month civil war. This development stokes fears of further fragmentation and undermines diplomatic efforts to resolve a conflict that has already displaced millions and killed an estimated 150,000 people.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were stranded inside a tunnel for over six hours due to a power failure. The incident left passengers in the dark and without air conditioning in the heat. The evacuation was delayed when some passengers attempted to leave the tunnel on foot, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety reasons. Eventually, all passengers were safely evacuated via emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, avoiding a worst-case scenario. Judge, who leads the majors in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 to 14 days, hoping to return initially as a designated hitter. The injury occurred while making a strong throw from the outfield during a recent game against Toronto.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in DR Congo, was murdered in 2007 after refusing bribes to allow a shipment of spoiled, potentially poisonous rice to enter the country. A devout Catholic, Kositi's stand against corruption was rooted in his faith and commitment to justice. Last year, the Catholic Church declared him a martyr, and he was recently beatified, a major step toward sainthood. His story is being held up as an example of integrity and courage in a region plagued by conflict and corruption.</p>

          <p>With the Euro 2025 final approaching, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during high-stakes matches and offer advice on how to cope. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an increased heart rate and other effects that last for hours. Experts suggest managing these feelings by getting enough rest, having a clear match-day plan, and using movement to release energy. They also emphasize reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>
