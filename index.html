          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the Trump administration will reveal several trade-related developments within the next 48 hours. This comes as foreign officials reportedly rush to secure deals before high tariff rates are reinstated. However, there is some confusion over deadlines, with officials stating that country-specific tariffs will not be collected until August 1, despite an initial July 9 date. Bessent also did not dismiss the possibility of becoming the next Federal Reserve chair if asked by President Trump.</p>

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook, claiming the company is not moving its manufacturing operations out of China quickly enough. Navarro characterized Cook's requests for more time as a long-running issue.

          <p>With credit card interest rates averaging over 21%, many Americans are exploring debt management programs to regain financial control. These programs, offered by credit counseling agencies, negotiate with creditors to lower interest rates and waive fees, consolidating multiple payments into one. While they don't reduce the principal balance, they can significantly lower monthly payments, often by 30% to 50%. This makes repayment more manageable and can shorten the time it takes to become debt-free, though it often requires closing the enrolled credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Forensic experts in Ireland have started the complex process of excavating a mass grave at the site of a former Catholic Church-run home for unmarried mothers in Tuam. The remains of approximately 800 infants and young children, who died between 1925 and 1961, are believed to be buried there. The excavation follows a government investigation that revealed an "appalling" mortality rate at the home. The project, which is expected to take about two years, aims to identify the remains and provide dignity to the deceased.</p>

Analysts express concern that Apple's Siri remains far behind competitors like ChatGPT, and that the company may need to look externally to catch up in the AI race.</p>

          <p>The devastating flash floods in Texas were caused by extreme rainfall, with some areas receiving upwards of 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. This deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The Texas Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding, but this event was exacerbated by a storm system that stalled over the region. Forecasters warn that more rain is possible, and flood watches remain in effect for the already hard-hit areas.</p>

Policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not help low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.

Researchers found that children today are more likely to suffer from obesity, chronic conditions like anxiety and depression, and sleep problems compared to previous years. The analysis of 170 indicators also showed that American children have a higher mortality rate than those in other high-income countries, largely due to premature births, firearm incidents, and car crashes.
