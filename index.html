          <p>President Trump contacted Jeff Bezos to express his discontent regarding a report that Amazon was considering displaying tariff costs on product listings. Shortly after the call, Amazon downplayed the report, and then announced the plan was scrapped. This pressure campaign followed a report that Amazon would show consumers the tariff amount added to each item's price. The White House press secretary criticized Amazon's consideration as a hostile and political act, referencing a previous report about Amazon's compliance with Chinese censorship demands.

          <p>Alzheimer's disease now affects over seven million people in the U.S., prompting experts to call for increased awareness, early detection, and support for caregivers. A new blood test offers a less invasive and more accessible method for predicting the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's before symptoms appear. The national cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's is projected to reach $384 billion in 2025, with unpaid care provided by family and friends valued at an additional $413 billion. Experts recommend a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, exercise, and managing high blood pressure to potentially reduce risk.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, stating that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is "doomed to fail". He argues that voters feel they are being asked to make financial sacrifices with minimal impact on global emissions. Blair's report calls for rapid deployment of carbon capture technology, greater use of AI for energy grids, and investment in small-scale nuclear reactors. Downing Street has rejected Blair's suggestions, while Labour sources maintain their commitment to the net zero agenda.</p>

          <p>With credit card rates averaging nearly 22%, many cardholders are struggling to make minimum payments, leading to an increase in bankruptcy inquiries. Chapter 7 bankruptcy erases most unsecured debts but may require giving up non-exempt assets, while Chapter 13 bankruptcy sets up a repayment plan. Debt settlement and debt management plans offer alternatives. It is worth exploring alternatives before committing to filing. (not investment advice)</p>
