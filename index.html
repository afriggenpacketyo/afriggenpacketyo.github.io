          <p>Tory Lanez, legally known as Daystar Peterson, was reportedly stabbed 14 times in a California prison, resulting in collapsed lungs and other injuries. According to an Instagram post, the incident occurred in a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi. Lanez, who is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion, is said to be in good spirits and breathing on his own after receiving medical attention. An investigation is underway to determine the motive behind the attack. The shooting case had previously divided the hip-hop community and led to considerable public attention.</p>

Republicans on Capitol Hill have responded with jokes and deflections when questioned about the potential gift. The luxury jumbo jet could be used as Air Force One, according to sources. The gift, estimated to be worth $400 million, has raised questions about the legality and appropriateness of accepting such a lavish present from a foreign government, especially given Trump's past criticisms of Qatar.</p>

          <p>A severe staffing shortage of air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia facility that manages Newark's air traffic led to extensive flight delays, some lasting up to seven hours. As few as three controllers were scheduled to work, far below the target of 14. The FAA moved management of Newark's air traffic to Philadelphia to hire more controllers, but the relocation angered some controllers. The agency is working on infrastructure upgrades and software updates to prevent future outages and plans to reduce the number of flights at the airport to reduce delays. </p>

          <p>Japan is experiencing a boom in gold investment due to growing concerns about a global economic slowdown caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Investors are seeking gold as a safe asset unlikely to plummet during economic turbulence. The benchmark price of gold in yen terms hit an all-time high in April. Products linked to gold price movements are popular among investment trusts, and more people are investing in pure gold monthly. (not investment advice)</p>
