            <p>Former Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald has been granted a temporary restraining order against Jenelle Anwar, who he claims has been stalking him since 2020. Donald alleges Anwar sent threatening emails, packages, and gifts, and even threatened the life of his son. Anwar filed for dissolution of marriage, seeking a $6.5 million settlement from Donald, whom he states she is married to. The restraining order requires Anwar to stay at least 100 yards away from Donald and his family and prohibits her from contacting them or possessing firearms.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in the online advertising technology market, siding with the Department of Justice and 17 states that sued the tech giant. The ruling stated Google engaged in anticompetitive practices, harming publishers and consumers. Google intends to appeal the decision, arguing its ad tech tools are effective and affordable. This marks the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year, following a ruling against its online search monopoly, and is considered a significant victory for antitrust enforcers, potentially affecting corporate decision-making.</p>

This suggests that AmEx's wealthier customer base is somewhat insulated from economic uncertainties.

            <p>With the S&P 500 losing momentum, investors are advised to consider strategies that diversify beyond the tech sector. Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies suggests moving into sectors with lower correlation to the overall index, such as those included in the Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF (TACK). TACK rebalances monthly to eliminate underperforming sectors and can hold gold and treasuries for a more defensive approach. This strategy aims to navigate a potentially prolonged bear cycle while still maintaining equity exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tariffs on goods from China could significantly impact the availability and affordability of baby products in the United States. Steve Dunn, CEO of Munchkin, warns that tariffs are forcing companies to halt orders and potentially cut jobs, which could lead to shortages of essential items like strollers and baby gates. The lack of manufacturing infrastructure in the U.S. makes it difficult to shift production domestically, and the tariffs are too high to be absorbed by businesses or passed on to consumers. This situation could make it more difficult and expensive for parents to care for their children.</p>

            <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old deported to El Salvador, has sparked legal debate over immigration policy. The White House alleges Garcia is a member of MS-13, which he denies, having no criminal convictions. Police cited Garcia's clothing and a confidential source as evidence of gang affiliation, though his lawyers dispute this, noting he was granted a "withholding of removal" order due to fear of persecution by a rival gang. The conflicting claims and lack of criminal record raise questions about the basis for the allegations.</p>

Advocates emphasize that autism is a spectrum, with varying levels of support needed, and that many individuals with autism lead fulfilling lives.
