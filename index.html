This visit occurred despite past backlash and sensitivity surrounding the shrine's association with Japan's wartime history and its impact on relations with neighboring countries.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge the freeze of over $2.2 billion in federal grants. The suit alleges that the freeze, enacted after Harvard refused to comply with demands to limit campus activism and reform admissions policies, is arbitrary and violates First Amendment rights. Harvard argues that the government's actions undermine research and innovation, while the White House defends the funding freeze by asserting that taxpayer funds are a privilege. The lawsuit underscores the escalating conflict between the Trump administration and universities over issues of academic freedom and government oversight.</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses are facing significant challenges due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and the elimination of the de minimis exemption. The cumulative tariff of 145% on Chinese goods is putting pressure on profit margins and disrupting supply chains. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, is expected to further impact these businesses. Many dropshippers are shifting their focus to European markets and diversifying their supply sources to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
