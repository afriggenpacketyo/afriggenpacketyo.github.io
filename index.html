          <p>A Canadian man faces second-degree murder charges after allegedly killing his 9-year-old daughter while on vacation in upstate New York. Authorities state Luciano Frattolin initially reported his daughter, Melina, as kidnapped near Lake George, prompting a massive search and an Amber Alert. Investigators found inconsistencies in his story, leading them to believe he fabricated the abduction after concealing her body in a remote pond. The motive for the tragic incident remains under investigation as officials await autopsy results.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, a vulnerability that could affect thousands of organizations globally. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) cautioned that the flaw allows unauthenticated access and remote code execution, posing a serious threat. Security researchers note that attackers can steal sensitive data and cryptographic keys, potentially leading to widespread data theft and password harvesting from connected Microsoft services like Outlook and Teams. Microsoft has released patches for some versions but is still working on a fix for others.</p>

          <p>This article highlights two individuals making a significant impact on others' lives through personal sacrifice and innovation. Brian Flynn, in a quest for meaning, became a rare double living organ donor, first donating a kidney to a stranger and later part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy. Separately, teenager Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease, invented "Infusion Hero," a specialized sweatshirt with zippered sleeves to provide warmth and comfort to patients during IV treatments. Both stories showcase how personal challenges and a desire to help can lead to extraordinary outcomes.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that the future of public service media (PSM), including the BBC and Channel 4, is under a "serious threat" as younger audiences increasingly favor platforms like YouTube. The watchdog suggests that to remain relevant, broadcasters must create more content for these platforms and that YouTube should give more prominence to their videos, particularly news and children's programming. Ofcom has proposed a six-point plan, including the possibility of new legislation to ensure PSM content is easily discoverable, to help preserve British culture and trusted news sources.</p>

          <p>A summer surge of COVID-19 is underway in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting that cases are growing or likely growing in at least 26 states and Washington, D.C. Medical experts note this follows an established seasonal pattern of summer and winter spikes, with overall severity gradually decreasing each season. While the newest variants, Nimbus and Stratus, are not considered more deadly, vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, and the immunocompromised are still at risk for severe illness. Current vaccines are effective against these variants.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has located the wreckage of HMS Nottingham, a Royal Navy warship sunk by a German submarine during World War One. The ship was found 60 miles off the coast of Scotland, 109 years after it went down on August 19, 1916, resulting in the deaths of 38 crew members. The international project team, ProjectXplore, positively identified the wreck at a depth of 82 meters using the ship's name stamp, dimensions, and other matching historical records. The discovery solves a century-old maritime mystery.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has announced it will not hand over data to French authorities, calling their criminal investigation "politically-motivated" and an attempt to "restrict free speech." French prosecutors are investigating allegations of algorithmic manipulation for foreign interference and fraudulent data extraction. X claims the demand for its recommendation algorithm and real-time user post data is an overreach of French law and raises serious concerns about the impartiality of the investigators involved. The Paris prosecutor's office stated the request is for technical verification and would be handled with confidentiality.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight bound for Minot, North Dakota, performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber during its landing approach. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that the military aircraft was not communicated to them by the control tower and was on a converging course at high speed. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a state fair flyover. The Federal Aviation Administration and SkyWest are both investigating the serious incident, which ended with a safe landing.</p>

          <p>The passage of the new Republican tax cut bill has left tax professionals and observers in a linguistic bind, as there is no consensus on what to call it. The official title, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," was struck down by Senate Democrats, leaving it technically nameless. Various acronyms like "OBBB," "TOBBB," and "OB3" are being used, but none have stuck. The confusion extends to provisions within the law, with well-known acronyms like GILTI being replaced by new, less catchy terms like NCTI, reflecting the hasty and secretive process through which the legislation was written.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons announced a significant shift in immigration enforcement policy, stating that his agents will arrest anyone they encounter who is in the country illegally, regardless of their criminal history. While prioritizing serious criminal offenders, this marks a reversal of the previous administration's focus and an end to the ban on so-called "collateral" arrests. Lyons also confirmed a crackdown on companies that hire unauthorized workers, vowing to hold employers accountable and not just the workers themselves, as part of the administration's broader immigration enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic plane crash occurred in Dhaka, Bangladesh, when a Chinese-made F-7 BGI training jet crashed into a school campus shortly after takeoff, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 100.

The pilot, who also died, reportedly made efforts to steer the malfunctioning aircraft away from more densely populated areas before the crash.

          <p>A new study has found that children who lived near Coldwater Creek in St. Louis, which was contaminated with radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project, had a significantly higher lifetime risk of developing cancer. Researchers discovered a "dose-response" relationship, where the cancer risk increased the closer a person's childhood home was to the polluted waterway. The findings corroborate long-held fears of residents and add scientific weight to the health consequences of nuclear waste exposure. This comes as new legislation aims to compensate families affected by radiation-linked cancers in the area.</p>

The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a "planning judgment rationally exercised," clearing the way for the major expansion.</p>

His comments come amid heightened tensions between the White House and the central bank over interest rate policy and a costly renovation project. Bessent questioned the Fed's performance, comparing its perceived mistakes to those of an agency like the FAA. He also backed the idea that the Fed should consider easing its benchmark interest rate given moderating inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
