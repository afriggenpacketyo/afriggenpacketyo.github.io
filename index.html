          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 02:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, marking a significant development in global resource supply chains. For years, logistical challenges, specifically the lack of railway infrastructure, hindered these African nations from exporting their vast iron ore deposits. The completion of new railway lines and port facilities by Chinese firms has now unlocked these resources, with Guinea's Simandou mine expected to start shipments in November. This infrastructure development will connect major mining sites, like the Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria, to Mediterranean ports, boosting trade and resource access for Beijing.</p>

          <p>Beijing has strongly condemned the European Union's decision to sanction two Chinese banks, demanding an immediate reversal of the "wrong practice." China's Ministry of Commerce has vowed to take necessary measures to protect the interests of its companies, escalating tensions just before a key summit. The summit is scheduled to include meetings between Chinese President Xi Jinping and top EU officials. According to sources, China had lobbied intensely to prevent the sanctions, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly warning of a response if the banks were included in the package.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell is set to captain the British and Irish Lions in their upcoming match against a First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This will be Farrell's first start on the tour, playing at inside centre in a lineup that excludes players from the first-Test victory over Australia. The squad for this game features nine Scottish players and all "geography players," who were called up as cover. While the game's relevance to the main Test series is limited, it offers opportunities for players like Blair Kinghorn and Farrell to contend for spots in the primary team for the second Test.</p>

          <p>The family of legendary England batter Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide last year, will host 'A Day for Thorpey' to celebrate his memory during an upcoming Test match. The event, held at The Oval on what would have been his 56th birthday, aims to raise money and awareness for the mental health charity Mind. Thorpe's family has spoken out about his struggle with depression and the importance of reducing the stigma around suicide and mental illness.

          <p>The Singapore dollar (SGD) is increasingly being recognized for its safe-haven characteristics, particularly during periods of financial stress in Asia. Analysts point to Singapore's strong institutional framework, resilient economy, and prudent policymaking as key factors bolstering the currency's stability. While it doesn't yet have the global status of the US dollar or Japanese yen, the SGD has strengthened significantly against a weakening greenback. Hurdles to becoming a top-tier safe haven include the relatively small size of its market and a managed exchange rate policy that, while ensuring stability, limits liquidity and large-scale speculation.

Following the withdrawal, humanitarian aid convoys have begun entering the city to address shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. Tensions remain, however, as Bedouin fighters have stated they will not fully leave the area until the Druze faction leader they blame for the conflict turns himself in.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are scheduled for closure due to severe fire safety issues, leaving residents facing homelessness and significant financial loss. Flat owners in Beech Rise and Willow Rise have reportedly spent up to £1 million of their own money on repairs and fees trying to save the buildings, which have deteriorated under a series of management companies. The situation is described by a local MP as a failure of the "broken leasehold system," where residents were responsible for upkeep costs while landlords collected ground rents. Knowsley Council also spent nearly £400,000 on safety patrols to prevent an earlier evacuation.</p>

          <p>A 158-year-old Northamptonshire transport company, KNP, was forced to cease operations and lay off 700 employees after a devastating ransomware attack. The breach is believed to have occurred when hackers from the "Akira" gang guessed a single employee's weak password, allowing them to encrypt company data and lock internal systems. The company was unable to pay the estimated £5 million ransom, resulting in a total loss of data and the subsequent collapse of the business.

          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a major IT outage on Sunday evening, forcing the carrier to implement a temporary, system-wide ground stop for all its flights as well as those of its subsidiary, Horizon Air. This marks the second time in just over a year that the airline has had to ground its entire fleet due to a technical failure. The company apologized for the inconvenience and warned of residual operational impacts throughout the evening, though the specific cause of the outage was not immediately disclosed. The incident adds to a series of recent disruptions in the aviation sector, including cyberattacks at other airlines.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, has died after a tragic accident involving an MRI machine at a clinic in New York. McAllister entered the MRI room while his wife was undergoing a scan and was wearing a 9kg (20 lbs) metal weight-training chain around his neck. The machine's powerful magnet immediately pulled him in by the chain, causing a "medical episode" from which he did not recover. His wife witnessed the event, stating the machine "snatched him" and he went limp in her arms. Such accidents are rare but highlight the extreme danger of bringing metallic objects near MRI machines.</p>

          <p>A stark contrast is emerging between the U.S. and China on energy policy, particularly as global demand for clean energy rises to power technologies like artificial intelligence. While China is forging ahead with significant investments in renewable energy, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power. This policy divergence is occurring as both nations invest heavily in new, power-intensive data centers. Beijing's strategy links green energy development directly to its pursuit of a global tech lead, while Washington's current approach prioritizes other energy sources over renewables.

          <p>Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey has maintained her political positions over the years without apology, generally leaning left and having supported Bernie Sanders in 2015. In a recent interview, she revealed that she once promised UFC President Dana White she would not speak negatively about Donald Trump. This promise was made out of loyalty to White, who told her Trump had provided a venue for the UFC when no one else would. Rousey emphasized that the promise was her own decision and continues to encourage her followers to get informed and participate in the democratic process, stressing the importance of local elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump is threatening to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is a "big clamoring" for the name change and that he might impose a "restriction" on the stadium project if the team does not comply. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after decades of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It is currently unclear what authority Trump could use to intervene in the project.</p>

The pilot expressed surprise that air traffic control at the nearby Minot Air Force Base had not provided a warning. It remains unclear how close the two aircraft came, but both SkyWest and the U.S. Air Force are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, a figure nearly three times higher than in the much more populous United States. The country now ranks among the top 10 globally for measles outbreaks, with Alberta being the provincial epicenter. The rapid spread is attributed to rising vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials note that the outbreak has spread significantly within some communities where vaccination rates have historically been lower, but the issue of low vaccination rates is now broader.</p>

Other drivers include massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, a re-shoring of manufacturing, and an anticipated increase in bank lending, all of which could fuel further economic growth.

          <p>The UK government is reviving its Pensions Commission to address warnings that people retiring in 2050 will be financially worse off than today's pensioners. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, nearly half of working-age adults are not saving into a private pension, with four in ten not saving enough for retirement. The analysis reveals significant gaps in pension savings among the self-employed, low earners, women, and certain ethnic groups. The commission will bring together experts, unions, and employers to develop a strategy to boost retirement savings and prevent a future shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>
