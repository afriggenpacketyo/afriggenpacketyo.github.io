          <p>President Trump asserted in a social media post that the U.S. has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran," a statement that contrasts with previous U.S. declarations that Israel's offensive against Iran was conducted without U.S. assistance. The White House has not clarified the president's statement, but Trump also used strong language regarding Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and suggested he was considering joining Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Vice President JD Vance indicated that Trump might take further action to end Iranian uranium enrichment, emphasizing the administration's focus on American interests. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem will remain closed due to the security situation, and citizens are advised against traveling to Israel.</p>

Other G7 members felt that a watered-down statement would be unfair to Ukraine, leading to its reflection in a statement issued by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

She voiced concerns about sweeping immigration raids, travel bans, and the treatment of migrants, suggesting the U.S. is turning against migrants and those not fully aligned with President Trump's agenda. While Navratilova agrees with Trump on the issue of transgender women's participation in sports, she worries about the loss of her own citizenship and appreciates every day after battling cancer.

Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military from 2015 to 2018 and has a pending Special Immigrant Visa case. DHS claimed his case was "improvidently issued," leading to his detention at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, sparking criticism from advocates who say this justification is being used to detain lawful asylum-seekers. The Trump administration has shown a sharp turn away from supporting Afghan allies, terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans and instituting a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments regarding President Trump's decision to deploy federal troops to Los Angeles, questioning both the legality of the deployment and the court's authority to review it. The administration argued that the president has nearly unlimited discretion to deploy the military on American streets to quell rebellion. California officials argued this interpretation was dangerously broad, while the court considered whether the deployment hindered the state's ability to respond to other crises like wildfires. The case tests the limits of presidential authority and is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's handling of Iran in a lengthy post on X, amid criticism from conservatives like Tucker Carlson. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and his efforts to reach a deal to prevent uranium enrichment. He assured that Trump is focused on using the American military to accomplish American people's goals. These comments come as some of Trump's most vocal supporters are speaking out against U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</p>

          <p>As Israel's attacks on Iran intensify, speculation has risen about the potential use of the U.S.'s GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, known as the bunker buster, against Iran's nuclear program. This 30,000-pound bomb, capable of penetrating 200 feet deep, is designed to target underground facilities like Iran's Fordo site. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which can carry two of these bombs, is stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. While Iranian officials deny working on nuclear weapons, Trump has warned Iran and backed Israeli attacks, remaining noncommittal about U.S. involvement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and the votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. This system has led to unusual alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a particular candidate from winning. The New York City Board of Elections will provide preliminary totals for first-choice votes on election night, but full results will be reported a week later due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Heart found that cannabis use is linked to a doubled risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, a 29% higher risk for acute coronary syndrome, and a 20% higher risk for stroke. The study analyzed data from 24 studies published between 2016 and 2023. With recreational marijuana legal in many states, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is moving to reclassify the drug to a less dangerous category. Experts call for the drug to be treated like tobacco, discouraged but not criminalized, and advocate for more research on the cardiovascular risks associated with different forms of cannabis exposure.</p>

The Senate Finance Committee released legislative text addressing Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, aiming to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. Differences between the House and Senate versions, particularly on state and local tax deductions and green energy rollbacks, could threaten the coalition needed to pass the bill. The Senate's deadline to pass the bill by July 4 adds further pressure to the negotiations.</p>

Some suggest China's hardball tactics around export controls on rare earth elements may have caught the U.S. delegation off guard.

While Americans demonstrated against Trump, the Democratic National Committee was splintering, and prominent leaders attended a glitzy Hamptons wedding.

Internal conflicts, such as the controversy surrounding David Hogg, and the departure of union leaders have further weakened the party's position.
