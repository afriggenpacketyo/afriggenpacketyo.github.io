          <p>Microsoft's stock increased by 7% in after-hours trading following a fiscal fourth-quarter report that surpassed analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, was a major driver of this success, generating nearly $30 billion in revenue. For the first time, Microsoft revealed that its Azure and other cloud services business has surpassed an annual revenue of $75 billion, growing 34% in the 2025 fiscal year. This strong performance comes despite recent layoffs and as the company celebrates its 50th anniversary.</p>

          <p>A jury in Arapahoe County, Colorado, has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for fatally poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, with arsenic in her protein shakes in 2023. The prosecution presented evidence of his incriminating internet searches, such as "how to make murder look like a heart attack." In addition to the murder charge, Craig was also convicted on five other counts, including soliciting an inmate to kill an investigator on his case. The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are contemplating changing chamber rules to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's nominees, citing what they describe as "unprecedented obstruction" by Democrats. Majority Leader John Thune stated that interest in such reforms is growing quickly to break the procedural logjam that has significantly slowed down appointments. While some senators like Tommy Tuberville advocate for staying in session through the August recess, others are focused on procedural modifications. The potential changes represent a further shift in Senate traditions, which have historically been resistant to such reforms.</p>

The company also provided a strong sales forecast for the upcoming third quarter, projecting revenue between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion, which is higher than analyst estimates.

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced its decision to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The central bank cited ongoing uncertainty about the economic outlook, particularly regarding the impact of tariffs on inflation, while noting that economic growth remains steady. The decision was not unanimous, with two FOMC members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is in good shape but faces risks, justifying the "wait-and-see" approach despite pressure from President Trump to lower rates.</p>

Vogler, who is 38, is reported to be awake and talking while receiving treatment at a burn center.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by SmartAsset reveals that San Jose, California, remains the most expensive metropolitan area in the U.S. to purchase a home, with a median price over $1.6 million. California cities occupy the top five spots on the list, a trend attributed to the state's highly productive economy and desirable lifestyle. The report highlights that strong demand, limited housing supply, and geographic constraints are key factors driving up prices in these costly markets. This continued price appreciation is making homeownership increasingly unaffordable for many, pushing them to rent for longer periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to leading humanitarian organizations, the hunger crisis in Gaza has reached a "worst-case scenario," with projections that 100 percent of the population will face acute food insecurity by September. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reports that widespread starvation and malnutrition are causing a rise in hunger-related deaths, particularly among children. Despite some aid being allowed into the territory, distribution is hampered by logistical challenges, security risks, and political disputes between Israel and the UN. Aid groups state that the current measures are insufficient to address the scale of the unfolding famine.</p>

          <p>In a recent court filing, the Department of Justice disclosed that the grand juries that indicted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell only heard direct testimony from two witnesses: an FBI agent and an NYPD detective. The filing, part of an effort to unseal the transcripts, clarified that no alleged victims testified directly before the grand juries. This move was initiated under a directive from President Trump to provide more public transparency into the investigations. The Justice Department is arguing for the release of the records to serve the public interest while remaining sensitive to the rights of victims.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates paused, borrowers facing high-rate debt, especially from credit cards, are encouraged to explore proactive relief strategies. This article suggests three key moves: conducting a detailed budget review to cut unnecessary spending, understanding the risks associated with different debt relief options like credit counseling or debt management, and addressing the root causes of debt accumulation. Taking these steps can help individuals regain financial control rather than waiting for potential rate cuts. The article emphasizes that a disciplined approach is crucial for long-term financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves that prompted warnings and advisories for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and other Pacific nations. In Russia, 16-foot waves caused flooding, while Hawaii and parts of California saw minor flooding and small waves after initial evacuation orders. While the most severe warnings were later downgraded, officials cautioned that dangerous currents could persist. The earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, also appeared to trigger volcanic activity on the Kamchatka Peninsula, with lava flowing from the Klyuchevskaya Sopka volcano.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is presiding over the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. The administration accuses de Moraes of human rights violations, censorship, and conducting a "politicized prosecution" against political opponents. In a related move, President Trump imposed 50% tariffs on many Brazilian imports, citing the actions of Brazil's government as undermining democratic values. The sanctions and tariffs represent a significant escalation in tensions between the Trump administration and the government of Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order placing a new 50% universal tariff on all copper imports, which will take effect on Friday. This action follows similar steep tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum and is aimed at boosting domestic industries. The announcement caused an immediate and sharp plunge in U.S. copper prices in after-hours trading, with mining company stocks also falling. Experts warn that the tariff could lead to increased prices for a wide range of consumer and industrial products that use copper, from electronics to construction materials, potentially impacting overall U.S. economic growth.

          <p>Shares of life sciences company Danaher have rallied since its recent earnings report, but analysts question if the momentum is sustainable. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China and reduced spending from biotech firms, though its latest quarter beat expectations. Management raised its full-year earnings guidance but kept its revenue growth outlook conservative, citing ongoing uncertainty. An RBC analyst suggests a sustained rally for the sector is still a quarter or two away, pending a return to mid-single-digit revenue growth, despite some positive signs in Danaher's performance.

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been federally indicted for his alleged role in an illegal, high-stakes poker operation run from a Los Angeles mansion he owned. Prosecutors claim the games, which took place from 2021 to 2022, were staffed with armed guards, chefs, and women who provided companionship for tips. Arenas and five other defendants, including a suspected member of an Israeli organized crime group, face charges for operating an illegal gambling business.

          <p>The annual tarantula mating season, primarily occurring in September and October, is expected to lead to a significant increase in sightings of the large, hairy spiders. Tens of thousands of male tarantulas will be actively searching for mates in states like California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. These spiders, which can reach the size of a baseball, are typically reclusive but become more visible as males wander in search of female burrows. The National Park Service notes that despite their intimidating appearance, tarantulas are generally timid and will not bite unless seriously provoked.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation to ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks, with Republican Senator Josh Hawley joining all committee Democrats in an 8-7 vote. The bill, named the PELOSI Act, would require lawmakers to sell their stocks within 180 days and certify their compliance annually. The vote highlighted a rift among Republicans, with Senator Rick Scott defending the right of lawmakers to be wealthy. It is not yet clear if the measure will receive a full vote on the Republican-controlled Senate floor.</p>
