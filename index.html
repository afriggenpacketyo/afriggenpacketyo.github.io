          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Polish voters to elect Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate backed by Donald Trump, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in Poland.

CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp claimed conservatives are battling against "globalists" and that similar threats are playing out in Poland. The conference took place near Rzeszow, a key hub for U.S. and Western weapons sent to Ukraine, underscoring Poland's role as a frontline NATO nation. </p>

Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, particularly regarding the long-range Taurus missile system. Merz's support contrasts with the cooler relationship between Zelensky and the previous chancellor, Olaf Scholz, reflecting a shift in German-Ukrainian relations.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S. and a carry trade unwind, as long-dated yields hover near record highs. Rising Japanese government bond yields could trigger a wave of capital repatriation, with Japanese investors pulling funds from the U.S., potentially leading to a global financial market downturn. Higher yields are strengthening the yen, impacting domestic appetite to invest abroad and potentially affecting U.S. tech stocks.

Despite the setback, Musk noted improvements, including reaching the scheduled ship engine cutoff and minimal heat shield tile loss during ascent.

Skomer is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills.

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is "continuing and permanent," rejecting the White House's attempt to portray it as temporary. Fourteen states sued Musk, DOGE, and President Trump, alleging that Musk lacked the legal authority to make sweeping changes to the federal government without Senate confirmation. The judge found that the states made a credible argument that Musk "occupies a continuing position" and "exercises significant authority" without proper appointment. While dismissing Trump as a defendant, the judge allowed the case to proceed, citing DOGE's "unauthorized access" to "private and proprietary information."</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a plan to upgrade its information technology (IT) manufacturing sector, aiming for self-sufficiency in key technologies such as semiconductors, batteries, satellite navigation, and artificial intelligence (AI). The 18-point action plan emphasizes AI integration and the development of specialized service providers by 2027. The plan targets over 85% of manufacturers using computer numerical control in key processes within two years and aims to complete a core industrial database by 2030. The blueprint was released by multiple ministries and commissions.</p>

          <h2>Outrage Follows Trump's Pardon of Chrisleys</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, convicted of fraud and tax evasion, has sparked widespread criticism. Critics condemn the move as an example of Trump's disregard for the law, citing the Chrisleys' conspiracy to defraud banks out of $30 million. The pardons are viewed by some as blatant corruption, given the Chrisleys' support for Trump and their daughter's campaign efforts. The pardon is part of a pattern of Trump pardoning individuals convicted of white-collar crimes and those with ties to his administration.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies will receive a maximum emission allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold. The system aims to incentivize emissions reduction, though companies may pass on decarbonization costs to consumers.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly considering military strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. This tension has led to discussions between President Trump and Netanyahu, with Israel seeking to ensure Iran cannot produce a nuclear weapon. Israel, not a participant in the negotiations, fears Trump may allow Iran to keep its uranium enrichment facilities in his eagerness for a deal. Israeli officials have signaled they may strike Iran even without U.S. assistance, despite skepticism about the effectiveness of such a strike.</p>

          <p>A report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggests that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is "unlikely in the near future" but "not impossible," particularly given the risks of misperception and miscommunication with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. The US–China relationship is described as "more strained than it has ever been," characterized by "deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms." While tactical improvements were made during the Biden administration, the report cautions that these are unlikely to alter the strategic direction between the two powers significantly during Trump's second term.</p>
