          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem testified before the Senate, where she was asked to define habeas corpus by Senator Maggie Hassan. Noem incorrectly stated that it is a constitutional right for the president to remove people from the country. Hassan corrected her, explaining that habeas corpus is the right to challenge government detention in court, a foundational right of free societies. Noem's agency is currently carrying out detentions and deportations that have been ruled as violations of habeas corpus rights by courts, creating controversy around her misunderstanding of the term.</p>

          <p>Maryland lawmakers have introduced a bill to posthumously award Henrietta Lacks a Congressional Gold Medal for her contributions to medical research through her HeLa cells, which were taken without her consent. Lacks' cells have been instrumental in developing treatments for diseases like polio and HIV/AIDS. The bill acknowledges the controversy surrounding the use of her cells without informed consent and aims to honor her legacy, while also highlighting the importance of ethical considerations in medical research. The Lacks family has previously sued pharmaceutical companies for using HeLa cells without permission, reaching a settlement with Thermo Fisher in 2023.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in the UK could be eligible for compensation up to £70 each following a court ruling that found Mastercard administered unfair fees between 1992 and 2008. The legal case, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions. Consumers who lived in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008, and bought goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard, are eligible to claim compensation.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail, Sterling Williams, was arrested for allegedly helping ten inmates escape. According to court documents, Williams admitted to turning off the water to a cell after an inmate threatened him with a makeshift knife. The inmates then removed a toilet from the wall and escaped through the opening, raising questions about jail security. Williams faces 10 counts of being a principal to simple escape and one count of malfeasance in office, while authorities continue to search for the remaining inmates and investigate potential accomplices.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver has been charged with felony assault for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a protest outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and others attempted to block the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was also arrested but had his trespassing charges dropped. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and a mischaracterization of events, while her attorney asserts that ICE agents escalated the situation into chaos.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the city of Chicago following comments made by Mayor Brandon Johnson regarding the high number of Black officials in his administration. The DOJ's civil rights division cited concerns that hiring decisions may have been based solely on race, violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Johnson's remarks, made at a church, emphasized the diversity of his administration and the importance of ensuring opportunities for Black residents, who he says have been historically underserved. The investigation comes amid a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on diversity, equity, and inclusion practices.</p>

          <p>Sable Offshore Corp. has resumed crude oil production off the Santa Barbara coastline, nearly ten years after a major oil spill prompted the closure of several drilling platforms. The announcement has sparked outrage among environmental groups and some state officials, particularly after the California Coastal Commission ordered the company to halt work and levied an $18-million fine for permit violations. Sable disputes the commission’s authority and insists it has obtained necessary permits.

          <p>Italy has expressed readiness to assist if the Vatican agrees to mediate talks on negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine, following President Trump's suggestion. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office stated that Italy is prepared to "facilitate contacts and work towards peace" and welcomes the Pope's willingness to host talks at the Vatican. However, there is no firm agreement yet, as recent discussions between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Istanbul resulted in additional demands from Moscow. While Ukraine is open to the Vatican as a host, the Kremlin prefers Turkey and seeks recognition of its annexation of four partially occupied regions of Ukraine and Crimea.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, who was a top donor in the 2024 election, has announced plans to scale back his political spending in the future, stating that he feels he has "done enough." This marks a significant shift after Musk poured over $200 million into the 2024 race and previously indicated that his America PAC would play a major role in future elections. Sources suggest this decision is influenced by frustration with Washington and increasing attacks on his companies, including Tesla and Twitter. Since joining the Trump administration as the head of DOGE, Musk's political involvement has decreased, and Tesla's stock has surged.</p>

          <p>The fetus of a brain dead Georgia woman, Adriana Smith, is continuing to grow, according to her mother, amid a nationwide debate about medical consent and anti-abortion laws. Smith, who was declared brain dead after suffering blood clots in her brain, is being kept alive to carry out her pregnancy due to Georgia's abortion ban, which includes provisions strengthening fetal personhood. Doctors plan to deliver the baby via caesarean section in early August, though the baby's health is uncertain. The case has sparked discussions about the reach of anti-abortion laws and the rights of pregnant individuals versus those of the fetus.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill is facing resistance from Republican dissidents in the House, who argue that its spending cuts are insufficient to reduce the national debt. The bill, which includes $4.9 trillion in tax breaks partially paid for by cuts to Medicaid and green energy, has been approved by the budget committee but faces further hurdles. Key points of contention include the amount to cut from the bill, cuts to Medicaid, and the level of state and local tax deductions, known as Salt.

          <p>The European Union approved a new package of sanctions targeting Russia's covert oil exports and is planning even tougher restrictions to intensify economic pressure on President Putin to end the war in Ukraine. The sanctions target Russia's "shadow fleet" of old tankers used to covertly transport and sell oil, adding to existing measures against individuals and companies. Ursula von der Leyen suggested potentially lowering the oil price cap as part of future sanctions. Despite the sanctions, Russia's economy has rebounded, partly due to heavy military spending and new markets, though fossil fuel export revenues have dropped and inflation has risen.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging, investors are considering adding the precious metal to their portfolios, but it's important to do so strategically. Experts recommend limiting gold investments to a maximum of 10% of the overall portfolio, avoiding riskier investment types like gold mining stocks, and monitoring the economic climate. Gold functions primarily as an income protector rather than an income producer, so balancing it with other assets is key. Monitoring the economic climate will help determine potential selling opportunities, ensuring that gold is working for the investor as intended. (not investment advice)</p>
