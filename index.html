          <p>President Trump announced that gold imports will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs ruling had indicated that gold bars from Switzerland, and potentially other nations, would face a 39% duty, causing concern within the precious metals market. Following Trump's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures experienced a significant drop, closing over 2% lower. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had previously warned that such tariffs could disrupt the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods. The order prevents the tariffs from increasing to near-embargo levels for an additional 90 days, providing a temporary reprieve in the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China. This development delays a significant escalation in trade tensions while negotiations potentially continue between the two economic powers. Further details on the specific goods affected were not immediately available in the brief announcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump has placed the Washington, D.C. police department under federal control and deployed 800 National Guard troops, citing a need to address crime in the capital. This unprecedented move utilizes the D.C. Home Rule Act, which allows a president to assume control during special emergencies. The action has drawn strong condemnation from local officials, including D.C.'s Attorney General, who argue it is unlawful and unnecessary, pointing to official statistics that show a decline in crime. The federal control is statutorily limited to 30 days unless extended by Congress.</p>

          <p>Forecasters have identified the formation of Tropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, marking the fifth named storm of the current hurricane season. Located west of the Cabo Verde islands, the storm is projected to move west and potentially strengthen into the season's first hurricane. Early models suggest it could become a major hurricane with winds of at least 111 mph as it approaches the Caribbean islands later in the week. Currently, Erin does not pose an immediate threat to the United States mainland.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police, this article examines the legal basis for the action: the Home Rule Act of 1973. Section 740 of this act grants the president authority to take control of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes during a declared emergency, though this control is limited to 30 days without congressional extension. The move has reignited debate over D.C.'s autonomy and its lack of statehood, with proponents like Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton arguing it highlights the need for full self-governance. Democrats have largely condemned the action as a power grab, while Republicans have praised it.</p>

          <p>In response to a new documentary about Billy Joel, his first wife, Elizabeth Weber, has stated she does not consider him a "homewrecker." The documentary details Joel's affair with Weber while she was married to his bandmate, an event that led to Joel's deep depression.

          <p>Football legend Alan Shearer describes Newcastle's pre-season as a "nightmare," citing a disastrous transfer window and the unresolved situation with star striker Alexander Isak, who wishes to join Liverpool. Shearer argues that Newcastle cannot sell Isak for Liverpool's £110m offer unless they secure two replacement strikers, a difficult task given the current market. He critiques the club's lack of leadership, noting the absence of a chief executive and sporting director, which has likely hindered their transfer strategy. Despite the turmoil, Shearer believes the team still has a strong core but will struggle to break into the top four this season.</p>

          <p>A prolonged and intense heat wave in Southern California is forecast to begin easing, though elevated temperatures will continue to pose health and fire risks. The scorching heat, with highs reaching 110 degrees in some areas, has fueled several wildfires, including the 5,370-acre Canyon fire, which is now mostly contained. Another major blaze, the Gifford fire, has burned nearly 120,000 acres and remains a significant concern for officials. While a cooling trend is expected to bring temperatures down by 10 to 15 degrees, the region will likely remain warm through September.</p>

Three specific groups are highlighted: those needing to supplement a fixed retirement income, those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash, and those who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to borrow against their home's equity without making monthly payments, providing tax-free funds.

The FCA clarified that no compensation scheme is in place yet and urged the public to hang up on such calls and never share personal banking information.</p>

          <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are extending their partnership with Netflix through a new multi-year, "first look" deal for films and television shows. This arrangement gives Netflix the first option on content proposals from their Archewell production company, replacing their previous, more rigid contract. The announcement dispels rumors that the couple was parting ways with the streaming giant and comes ahead of the second season of Meghan's cookery show. The financial terms were not disclosed, but the previous deal was reportedly worth about $100 million.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, U2 frontman Bono has issued a strong condemnation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for its actions in Gaza. While acknowledging the evil of the October 7th attack by Hamas, which included sexual assault, murder, and abduction, Bono argues Israel's response has become disproportionate and morally indefensible. He expresses revulsion for this moral failure and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, unfettered humanitarian aid access, and a return to a path of peace and a two-state solution. The band has pledged to donate to Medical Aid for Palestinians.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed he personally negotiated a deal with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to allow the company to sell its H20 AI chips to China. In an unprecedented arrangement, Nvidia will pay the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from these sales in exchange for the necessary export licenses. Trump stated he initially asked for 20% before settling on the lower figure. The deal is a new development in the ongoing effort to control China's access to advanced technology, with the H20 chip being a less powerful version designed to comply with U.S. export controls.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the strategic differences between Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities for retirement planning. It positions IRAs as vehicles for growth and flexibility, ideal for younger savers who can tolerate market risk, while annuities offer guaranteed income and security, often appealing to those nearing retirement. The piece suggests a hybrid approach can be effective, where an IRA is used for wealth accumulation during one's career, and a portion is later converted to an annuity to create a stable income floor for essential expenses in retirement. The optimal strategy depends on an individual's specific financial situation and goals. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are describing the Trump administration's deal with Nvidia and AMD, which requires the companies to share 15% of certain China sales revenue with the U.S. government, as highly unusual but characteristic of the president's transactional approach. In exchange for the revenue cut, the chipmakers receive licenses to sell their H20 and MI308 chips in China. Investors view the deal as a net positive, as it secures access to the lucrative Chinese market. However, the move raises long-term questions about whether Washington might seek similar arrangements in other strategic sectors, though experts believe it's unlikely to extend beyond semiconductors.</p>

          <p>The integration of generative AI into online shopping is set to cause a seismic shift, with platforms like ChatGPT potentially enabling users to complete purchases directly within a chat interface. This could streamline the buying process but also disrupt the existing e-commerce value chain by shifting control of the pre-sale experience to AI assistants. Experts predict this will create an existential threat for platforms that rely on user browsing time, as AI will increasingly guide product discovery and purchasing decisions. This change could reroute billions in retail media revenue toward companies that own the conversational AI layer.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned President Trump that he will push to redraw California's congressional maps if Republicans proceed with redistricting efforts in Texas and other red states. In a letter to Trump, Newsom accused the GOP of attempting to "rig the upcoming midterm elections" by gerrymandering districts to their advantage. He stated that if Republican-led states do not stand down, California will be forced to redraw its own maps to neutralize any potential gains. The warning comes as Texas Democrats have fled their state to prevent a quorum for the redistricting legislation.</p>

          <p>Lithium stocks surged after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL has suspended production at its Yichun Project mine, a key global supplier. The company confirmed its permit expired and it is working on renewal, but the halt has tightened an already constrained market. The Yichun mine accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025. In response to the expected drop in supply and subsequent price increase, shares of U.S. miner Albemarle jumped over 9%, and the Sprott Lithium Miners ETF surged nearly 14%.</p>
