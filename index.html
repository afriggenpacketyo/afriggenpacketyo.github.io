          <p>A US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump can deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, overturning a lower court's injunction. This decision allows approximately 200 troops to protect federal buildings, despite opposition from local and state officials who argue the intervention is unnecessary. The ruling is part of a broader federal effort to deploy National Guard units to several Democratic-led cities amidst ongoing protests. This legal battle highlights the contentious relationship between federal and local authorities regarding civil unrest and presidential power.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a significant outage, causing widespread disruptions across numerous major websites and applications for over 12 hours. The issue originated in AWS's main US-East-1 region, impacting critical services like EC2 and DynamoDB, which underpin a vast portion of the internet. Companies such as Disney+, Lyft, McDonald's, Reddit, and various government sites reported problems, highlighting global reliance on a few major cloud providers. While AWS engineers worked to restore services, the incident underscored the fragility of centralized internet infrastructure and the rapid spread of impact when core systems fail.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas, though a shadow of its former self, is reasserting authority through violent crackdowns on opponents and aid looters. US President Donald Trump initially gave a green light for Hamas to restore order but later hardened his stance, threatening intervention if violence continued. Experts debate Hamas's future, with some believing it will eventually lay down arms for an international stabilization force, while others remain skeptical, fearing it will retain power. The article explores Hamas's history, its extensive tunnel network, and the decimation of its leadership, suggesting a potential rebranding to maintain a political role.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that microchips implanted into the eyes of legally blind patients, combined with special glasses, have helped some regain the ability to read. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) treatment, involving a hair-thin implant and camera-equipped glasses, showed meaningful visual acuity improvement in 26 out of 32 geographic atrophy patients. This advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration affects millions, and until recently, lacked treatments to improve reading or face recognition. While promising, the PRIMA implant is not yet licensed for widespread use outside of trials.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has filed motions to dismiss his federal indictment, arguing it stems from "President Trump's personal animus" and constitutes vindictive prosecution. His legal team also contends that interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who signed the indictment, was unlawfully appointed, violating federal statutes. The defense highlights Trump's public statements calling for Comey's prosecution as evidence of political motivation. This challenge, which follows similar successful challenges to other interim U.S. attorney appointments, raises significant questions about the legitimacy of the charges and the independence of the Department of Justice.</p>

The report also cited a lack of oversight by Carris, the public transport company, and its outsourced maintenance firm, alongside a malfunctioning emergency brake system. Lisbon's mayor attributed the tragedy to technical causes, while Carris stressed that the full report is still pending.</p>

          <p>Billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, a key OpenAI shareholder, publicly defended AI startup Anthropic, calling it "one of the good guys" after criticism from David Sacks, President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar. Hoffman, whose firm Greylock also invested in Anthropic, praised the company's commitment to deploying AI thoughtfully and safely. This public sparring between the former PayPal Mafia members highlights the growing political divide over AI safety and regulation. Sacks accused Anthropic of "regulatory capture" through "fear-mongering," underscoring the intense debate shaping the future of artificial intelligence development.</p>

          <p>Cuba's vibrant reparto music scene, a fusion of reggaetón, timba, and Afro-Cuban rhythms, is witnessing a growing presence of women, known as reparteras, challenging its traditionally male-dominated and often misogynistic lyrics. Artists like Seidy La Niña, Melanie Santiler, and Ozunaje are breaking barriers, asserting their voices and perspectives in a genre that often objectifies women. They navigate challenges of authenticity, beauty standards, and industry resistance, while advocating for an evolution of reparto's vocabulary to broaden its appeal. These women are not only creating music but also reflecting and influencing cultural shifts within Cuba's marginalized communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's new Pay Equity Enforcement Act (SB 642), signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, offers hope for significantly reducing the nation's widest wage gap, particularly for Latinas. Effective January 2026, the law expands the definition of "wages" to include non-traditional compensation, requires employers to provide good faith pay estimates, and extends the statute of limitations for wage claims to six years. Latinas in California currently earn only 49 cents for every dollar earned by white men, facing a lifetime wage loss exceeding $1 million. This legislation, co-sponsored by HOPE (Hispanas Organized for Political Equality), aims to address systemic issues and promote long-term economic gains.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded to nationwide "No Kings" protests by posting an AI-generated video depicting himself as a fighter pilot dumping sewage on protesters, a tactic analyzed as an authoritarian playbook move. The protests, which saw millions demonstrate against Trump's policies, were largely peaceful and driven by a desire to remind the government of public dissatisfaction. Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Ted Cruz, attempted to smear protesters as "Marxists" or "paid agents." This article suggests Trump's response aims to discourage participation and silence critics, raising concerns about the future of free speech and democracy in America.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Border Patrol official testified that agents involved in Chicago-area immigration enforcement are now equipped with body cameras, following a judge's order. This development comes amidst a lawsuit by news organizations and community groups challenging the Trump administration's tactics, which have led to over 1,000 arrests and complaints of combative methods. The official defended the use of tear gas on protesters, citing safety concerns when agents were impeded from leaving a scene.
