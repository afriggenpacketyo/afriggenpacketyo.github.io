          <p>A new budget package signed into law includes a provision eliminating federal income tax on tips for service workers like waiters and bartenders. The White House promotes this as a benefit for the working class, estimating it could increase take-home pay by an average of $1,675 annually. However, critics and policy analysts argue the measure is temporary, expiring in 2028, and will not benefit the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal tax liability. They suggest raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to help low-wage employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebrations next year. During a speech in Iowa, Trump stated he had discussed the idea with UFC CEO Dana White, envisioning an event for 20,000 to 25,000 people. This would be an unprecedented event, as the White House has never hosted a professional sporting competition. The proposal highlights Trump's close relationship with White and his frequent attendance at UFC events since returning to office.</p>

          <p>Google is rolling out "Ask Photos," a new AI-powered feature within Google Photos that allows users to search their image libraries using natural language queries. Powered by the Gemini AI model, the tool can understand complex and contextual questions, such as "Show me the best photo from each national park I've visited." After a brief pause to improve speed and quality, the feature is now more widely available in the U.S. for users over 18. Google assures users that their photos are not used for advertising, though some queries may be reviewed to enhance the service.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders held their first-ever summit in Chisinau, Moldova, to signal strong support for the country's bid to join the bloc. Moldovan officials are eager to advance membership negotiations before their September elections, citing the need to counter Russian disinformation campaigns. The process is complicated by Hungary's obstruction of similar talks for Ukraine, which began its accession process alongside Moldova. The summit aims to reassure Moldova of the EU's commitment to its sovereignty and resilience amid Russia's ongoing aggression and hybrid threats in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing criticism from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes in his new spending bill, Trump used the slur, which originates from a Shakespearean character and evokes harmful stereotypes about Jewish people and greed. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he understood it to mean a moneylender who charges high rates.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint alleging that scammers fraudulently obtained over $250,000 in cryptocurrency by impersonating the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. The perpetrators used deceptive email addresses, closely mimicking the official one, to trick a victim into sending the funds as a purported donation. The complaint states the emails appeared to be from the committee's co-chair. The U.S. government is now seeking the permanent seizure of nearly $40,400 of the stolen funds that have been recovered from a cryptocurrency exchange account.</p>

          <p>The UK's Attorney General's Office will review the sentence of a 15-year-old boy who was convicted of manslaughter for killing an 80-year-old man in Leicestershire. The boy, who racially abused and attacked Bhim Kohli in a park, was sentenced to seven years in custody. The Solicitor General referred the case to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme after deeming the punishment potentially too light for the crime. The victim's family has expressed disappointment with the original sentence, arguing that it does not match the severity of the fatal attack.</p>

          <p>Russia has unleashed its largest aerial assault on Kyiv since the war began, launching approximately 550 drones and 11 missiles at the Ukrainian capital. The overnight attack, which killed at least one person and injured over 20, came shortly after President Trump held separate, unproductive phone calls with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy described the bombardment as a "harsh, sleepless night" and stated that he and Trump had a "very important and useful conversation" about increasing Ukraine's air defense capabilities following the attack.</p>

          <p>The ACLU and other legal groups have filed a federal class-action lawsuit alleging that U.S. immigration agents in Southern California are engaging in widespread racial profiling. The lawsuit claims agents are targeting people based on their appearance or location, such as Latino-heavy work sites, and arresting them without reasonable suspicion. Advocates argue that the Trump administration's ambitious daily arrest quotas are pressuring agents to cut corners, leading to unconstitutional seizures. The Department of Homeland Security has denied the claims, stating that its enforcement operations are highly targeted and not based on race.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a landmark 870-page policy bill into law, enacting key agenda items including extending the 2017 tax cuts and boosting defense and immigration enforcement spending. The package also introduces new tax breaks on tipped income and overtime but makes steep cuts to Medicaid. The bill passed Congress on narrow, party-line votes, with Republicans concerned about its impact on the national debt and Democrats warning it disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The White House claims the bill will stimulate economic growth, a point contested by many economists and the Congressional Budget Office. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to save Miami's iconic reefs, scientists are transplanting fragments of crossbred coral onto a reef devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other partners, involves breeding native Florida Elkhorn corals with corals from a warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to introduce genetic diversity and create more "thermally tolerant" corals that can better survive rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change. This marks the first time an international crossbreeding effort of this kind has been permitted for planting onto wild reefs in the region.</p>

Authorities said two of the injured residents are in severe condition, and prosecutors have opened an investigation into the cause, which may be related to a leak during a gas delivery.</p>

          <p>Germany has committed to a massive increase in defense spending to make its armed forces "ready for war," a move hailed by the arms industry as a major economic stimulus. However, some economists are skeptical that this spending will translate into broad economic growth. A study from the University of Mannheim suggests that military spending has a low return on investment compared to infrastructure or education, generating only 50 cents of economic activity for every euro spent. Critics warn the spending may primarily boost arms companies' profits rather than Germany's overall defense capabilities or economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The victim's bravery in reporting the crime led to the first-of-its-kind prosecution.
