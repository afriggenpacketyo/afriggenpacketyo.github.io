          <p>Oracle has appointed Clay Magouyrk, its cloud infrastructure president, and Mike Sicilia, its industries president, as new co-CEOs, signaling a strategic shift in leadership. Current CEO Safra Catz will transition to an executive vice chair role on the company board. This move is designed to harness the specialized expertise of both executives, particularly in the rapidly expanding cloud and industry-specific software sectors, to drive future growth. However, the announcement was met with an initial dip in company shares during premarket trading, reflecting market participants' immediate reactions and ongoing evaluations of the new leadership structure and its potential impact on the technology giant's trajectory.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing for an intense week of diplomacy at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where he will advocate for robust international action against Russia. The visit comes as concerns grow that Russia's three-year war in Ukraine could extend into NATO territory, following recent alleged Russian drone and jet incursions into Polish and Estonian airspace. Zelenskyy plans to meet with President Trump to discuss peace efforts, despite Moscow showing no signs of accepting a negotiated solution that involves concessions. European leaders warn that Russia might be using negotiations to buy time while intensifying its military assault, making Zelenskyy's push for further sanctions crucial.</p>

          <p>An animal handler, Ryan Easley, was tragically killed by a tiger at the Growler Pines Tiger Preserve in southeastern Oklahoma. The preserve confirmed Easley's death as an "accident" involving one of the big cats he cared for, acknowledging the inherent dangers but emphasizing his profound love and respect for the animals. All tours at the private facility, which allows visitors to view and learn about tigers, have been canceled indefinitely following this devastating incident. The tragedy has also drawn attention to the origins of the preserve's tigers, with animal rights groups noting connections to controversial figures from the "Tiger King" series.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 08:10:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK, under leader Nigel Farage, has announced a significant overhaul of immigration policy, proposing to scrap indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for migrants. This new plan would mandate that migrants reapply for visas every five years, subject to stricter requirements including higher salary thresholds and improved English language skills, affecting hundreds of thousands currently in the UK. Farage contends that the existing system, which allows permanent residency and benefit claims after five years, is unsustainable and attributes recent immigration levels to a "Boriswave" of looser rules. The controversial proposal has drawn criticism from opposition parties, who raise concerns about its economic viability and potential disruption, contrasting with the government's own more modest plans to extend ILR application periods.</p>

          <p>A senior source suggests that Saudi Arabia's recently established mutual defense pact with Pakistan will not likely impact its vital energy relationship with India. The source, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the topic, clarified that Riyadh aims to enhance its security through broader alliances without jeopardizing crucial commercial ties, especially with key crude consumers such as India. India remains one of Saudi Arabia's top three oil customers, alongside Russia and Iraq. This article also refutes persistent rumors of Saudi Arabia moving away from the U.S. dollar for oil trade, underscoring the greenback's continued importance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te's approval rating has sharply declined, with a new "Annual Cross-Strait Relations Survey" revealing that over 60% of eligible voters disapprove of his approach to cross-strait relations. This significant 20-point drop from the previous year underscores mounting public unease regarding Lai's leadership, particularly as Beijing's military pressure on the island intensifies. A majority of respondents now advocate for dialogue with mainland China over confrontation, marking a dramatic shift in sentiment just 16 months into Lai's term. The poll results suggest growing skepticism among the populace about the president's capacity to effectively manage Taiwan's most critical international relationship.</p>

Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly rejected the plan, threatening retaliation.

Lamb-Shapiro argues that while self-help books have a long history and some offer valuable insights, the modern obsession with self-improvement can detract from the benefits of seeking help and strengthening relationships within a community.

While hailed by the government as a "no-brainer for growth," the project faces strong opposition from the Green Party and local groups concerned about climate impact, noise, and infrastructure strain.

The article highlights how this overlooked demographic, representing half of all Black children, has been largely ignored in family structure studies.

          <h2>Inquest Reveals Former Rugby Star Tom Voyce Was Over Drink-Drive Limit Before Death</h2>

          <p>An inquest has disclosed that former England rugby international Tom Voyce was nearly three times over the legal drink-drive limit when his vehicle was tragically washed into a river during a storm last December. The 43-year-old had attended a shoot and subsequently visited a pub with a group before his disappearance and eventual death. Pathologist Clive Bloxham testified that while Voyce's high blood alcohol levels would have severely impaired his judgment and coordination, they were not definitively identified as the causal factor in his demise. The ongoing inquest continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the decorated rugby player, who had a distinguished career before retiring in 2013.</p>

However, there's a noticeable retreat from early-stage startup and seed funding, with a preference for growth-stage investments due to perceived lower risk.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article elucidates the key differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, providing essential insights for investors aiming to diversify their portfolios. A fundamental distinction lies in their trading mechanisms: ETFs are traded like stocks on an exchange, allowing for real-time pricing throughout the day, whereas mutual fund transactions occur once daily at the market's close. Financial experts highlight that ETFs offer a significant tax efficiency advantage, often bypassing the capital gains distributions that mutual fund shareholders might incur, thanks to their unique "in-kind" transaction process. Moreover, ETFs typically present lower expense ratios, positioning them as a more cost-effective investment choice, especially within taxable brokerage accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the 2024 presidential election, many Democrats acknowledged that their perceived leftward shift on cultural issues contributed to their loss, yet few have publicly adjusted their stances. Despite calls from pundits and some officials to broaden the party's appeal and reconnect with working-class voters, most elected Democrats have shied away from taking controversial moderate positions. The article highlights a "strange dynamic" where the party focuses on rhetorical adjustments rather than substantive policy changes, largely due to fear of primary challenges from the left. This reluctance to publicly deviate from progressive orthodoxies could hinder their ability to win back crucial swing states and regain control of the Senate.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are warning that if President Trump succeeds in his efforts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, potentially allowing him to appoint loyalists, he could gain "unimaginable power" over the U.S. financial system. Beyond merely setting interest rates, control of the Fed's emergency lending provisions could allow the president to direct trillions of dollars to favored industries or even personal businesses, effectively creating a "bottomless slush fund." Furthermore, the ability to "debank" institutions by cutting off access to the financial system could be weaponized to punish political enemies.
