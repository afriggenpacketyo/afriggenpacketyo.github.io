          <p>Russian forces launched a series of drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, resulting in at least three fatalities and numerous injuries, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The attacks targeted Kyiv, Lutsk, and the Ternopil region, with Russia claiming they were a response to Ukrainian "terrorist acts." Zelenskyy called on the United States, Europe, and the global community to increase pressure on Russia to end the war, emphasizing that inaction equates to complicity. The strikes disrupted Kyiv's train system and forced civilians into underground shelters as air defenses engaged incoming drones. Optimism is low given the rising death toll.</p>

          <p>A legal battle has commenced over Jimmy Buffett's $275 million estate, with his widow, Jane Buffett, seeking the removal of co-trustee Richard Mozenter. Jane alleges Mozenter failed to act in her best interests regarding the marital trust, accusing him of hostility and withholding financial information. Mozenter has reportedly filed a counter-petition to remove her as co-trustee and representative of the estate. The dispute centers on the management of the trust and concerns over the income it generates, particularly related to Buffett's Margaritaville empire.</p>

          <p>The United States men's national team faces a challenging summer as it prepares for the 2026 World Cup, with the upcoming Gold Cup presenting a unique set of circumstances.

However, the Gold Cup still offers an opportunity for the USMNT to rehabilitate its reputation and identify new depth pieces within its roster. Coach Mauricio Pochettino has a chance to cultivate closeness and feistiness, qualities that have been lacking in recent performances, while key players such as Malik Tillman and Johnny Cardoso will have a chance to prove their worth.</p>

Smith recounts how Alessandra Williams helped save the film by raising money to buy it from Miramax, and he is now touring with the remastered version, pairing screenings with Q&As and stand-up performances.

The author contends that a true warrior respects those they disagree with, and Hegseth's actions are a disgrace to the values the military is supposed to uphold.

          <p>The author recounts her experience as a harried Los Angeles co-parent, navigating shared custody, dating, and caring for a cat she never wanted. Initially getting the cat to promote uniformity between households, she grew to resent the pet ownership and the responsibilities it entailed. Over the years, she grappled with guilt and societal expectations, eventually finding the courage to relinquish the cat after her daughter went to college. The author reflects on the challenges of co-parenting and the evolving dynamics of family life.</p>

Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The scale of the agriculture is surprising given the northerly location and challenging growing conditions, suggesting a significant investment of labor in crop cultivation.

          <p>A team of scientists has discovered evidence of the world’s earliest known matrilineal society in ancient China, dating back approximately 4,500 years. Analyzing ancient DNA from 60 individuals, the team confirmed the existence of a Neolithic community in Shandong that traced its descent through the female line for 250 years. The findings suggest that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation. This discovery sheds light on the diverse social structures of early human societies.</p>
