            <p>In a surprise move, Turkey's central bank raised its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 46%, signaling an end to its easing cycle amidst economic challenges. The decision is a response to economic disruption caused by U.S. tariffs, political upheaval, and investor flight following the arrest of a prominent opposition leader. The Monetary Policy Committee emphasized the importance of a tight monetary stance to curb domestic demand, appreciate the Turkish lira, and improve inflation expectations, aiming to achieve price stability. The central bank has also spent billions defending the lira, highlighting the severity of the economic situation.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports could significantly impact the prices and availability of everyday electronics in the U.S., including toasters, hair curlers, and alarm clocks, which are almost entirely imported from China. While some electronics like smartphones have diversified manufacturing locations, many common household items lack alternative sources, making them vulnerable to shortages and price hikes. The article suggests that the secondary market for refurbished electronics may see increased demand, but even this market could be affected by tariffs on components and labor costs. Panic buying and streamlining of product lines by companies are also expected as consumers and businesses grapple with tariff uncertainty.</p>

The case has reached the Supreme Court, with a judge repeatedly rebuking the Trump administration for non-compliance.</p>

            <p>French luxury brand Hermès will increase its prices in the United States starting in May to offset the impact of President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. The price increase will apply exclusively to the U.S. market and is intended to fully offset the 10% tariff imposed by the White House. This decision is expected to affect the prices of Hermès' iconic handbags and scarves, potentially impacting U.S. consumers who purchase these luxury items. The company reported 11% sales growth in the Americas during the first quarter, representing nearly 17% of its total sales revenue.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in North Dakota ruled that over 9,000 Catholic employers are not required to abide by federal regulations protecting workers seeking abortions and fertility treatments. The ruling permanently blocks regulations from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, citing a violation of federal law protecting religious freedom.

This decision led to Netflix's growth into a streaming giant with a market cap of over $400 billion.

            <p>President Trump has once again called for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, expressing dissatisfaction with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's policies. In a Truth Social post, Trump criticized Powell for being "too late and wrong" and suggested that his termination could not come soon enough. Trump's comments come as the European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates, and he argues that the U.S. economy is strong enough to warrant similar action, citing lower oil prices and the benefits of tariffs.</p>

As of Thursday morning, approximately 41% of customers had their power restored, with the utility company aiming to restore 90% within 48 hours. This outage is the second island-wide blackout in less than four months, prompting renewed calls for the government to cancel contracts with the power companies. The governor has promised to heed these calls, acknowledging the unacceptability of such failures and the significant economic losses they cause.</p>

Kennedy emphasized the need to investigate environmental factors, directing the National Institute of Health to explore potential culprits ranging from mold to obesity. While experts acknowledge that environmental factors could play a role, they also point to the broadening definition of autism as a significant contributor to the rising diagnosis rates. Kennedy's focus on environmental exposures has drawn both support and criticism from the scientific community.</p>
