          <p>Court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who had a "bailout plan" for his family. Boelter's wife told investigators they were preparing for major incidents and that he instructed her to go to her mother's home in Wisconsin if necessary. Investigators found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffman family, victims of the shooting, expressed their grief and concern about the risks of public service in a politically divided world. </p>

          <p>Arturo Gamboa, who was jailed on suspicion of murder for allegedly brandishing a rifle at a “No Kings” rally in Utah, has been released from custody. The local district attorney's office stated that it was unable to make a decision on charges against Gamboa, but the investigation into the shooting that killed Arthur Folasa Ah Loo continues. Gamboa is forbidden from possessing firearms and must live with his father. The volunteer who fired the shot that killed Ah Loo has not been publicly identified, and the circumstances surrounding the shooting remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of journalists for Voice of America (VOA) have been fired by the Trump administration, effectively shutting down the US-funded news outlet. Kari Lake, appointed by the president to run VOA, announced the layoffs of 639 employees, stating that the agency was "riddled with dysfunction, bias and waste". The move has been expected since March when Trump ordered VOA, as well as USAGM, to be "eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law". A statement issued by three VOA journalists who have been suing to stop the elimination of the network said about the latest firings: "It spells the death of 83 years of independent journalism that upholds US ideals of democracy and freedom around the world."</p>

Jack Reed criticized President Donald Trump's rebuke of his own intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting that Trump is disavowing the intelligence community for political reasons. Gabbard testified that the intelligence community assesses that "Iran is not building a nuclear weapon". Trump stated that both Gabbard and his intelligence community are "wrong". Reed believes Trump's stance is related to a potential attack against Iran and the need to conclude that Iran has the capacity and intent to develop a nuclear weapon quickly.</p>

This is the second fatal balloon accident in Brazil in less than a week, with a woman dying during a hot air balloon ride in Sao Paulo state recently.</p>

Eckart Woertz argues that a ground invasion would be required to force a change of government in Iran, and there is no strong rebel movement within the country to topple the current regime.</p>
