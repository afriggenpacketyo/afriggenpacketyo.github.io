          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 13:35:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has indicated he may deploy military troops to Chicago for a large-scale immigration and crime enforcement operation, similar to actions previously taken in other cities. The suggestion, made via a social media post, prompted a sharp rebuke from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who characterized it as a threat against an American city. Reports indicate the Department of Homeland Security is preparing for a potential multi-week operation, requesting space at a nearby naval station. This potential action raises significant legal questions, especially after a federal court ruled that a similar deployment in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Universal Postal Union, a United Nations agency, reported that postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by more than 80% since the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The rule change ended the "de minimis exemption," which allowed parcels valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free. The sudden shift placed the burden of customs duty collection on postal operators and carriers, many of whom were unprepared for the new requirements. As a result, 88 international postal operators have suspended some or all services to the U.S., causing major disruptions to the global mail network.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has confirmed a significant cyberattack that compromised the personal, financial, and health-related data of almost 870,000 people, including students, employees, and applicants. The breach was discovered following a network outage in June, which was caused by an unauthorized party accessing the university's systems and stealing sensitive information. The stolen data includes names, Social Security numbers, academic histories, and some health and insurance details. In response, Columbia has notified affected individuals, reported the incident to law enforcement, and is offering two years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services while working to enhance its cybersecurity measures.</p>

New appointments, such as business executive Jason Stockwood to a business minister role, suggest an effort to bring more private sector experience into the government as it seeks to regain momentum.</p>

          <p>Gunmen in Nigeria's southern Edo state attacked a convoy, killing eight security officials and kidnapping several Chinese expatriate workers employed by a local cement company. According to the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the attack was carried out by a group of suspected armed kidnappers. A subsequent rescue operation successfully freed four of the kidnapped Chinese nationals, though one remains missing. The incident highlights the escalating security challenges in Nigeria, where armed gangs frequently carry out attacks and kidnappings for ransom, a problem that is increasingly affecting the southern regions of the country in addition to the north.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he knew "nothing" about a classified 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea, as reported by The New York Times. The article alleged that the mission, which Trump reportedly approved, resulted in the deaths of unarmed North Korean civilians during an operation to plant a communications interception device. According to the report, the SEALs opened fire on a boat they feared had spotted them, only to discover the crew were likely civilians diving for shellfish. Trump claimed to be hearing about the incident for the first time when questioned by reporters, while the Pentagon has declined to comment on the matter.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London's Parliament Square against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in at least 150 arrests.

The Metropolitan Police reported that officers faced significant abuse, while human rights groups like Amnesty International criticized the arrests as a shocking suppression of peaceful protest and free speech.</p>

          <p>Zach Yadegari, an 18-year-old entrepreneur, is the co-founder and CEO of Cal AI, a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to estimate the calorie count of food from a photo. Launched in May 2024, the app has quickly gained traction, now generating approximately $1.4 million in gross profit per month. Yadegari, who began coding at age seven, developed the app to solve the tedious problem of manual calorie tracking. Now a freshman at the University of Miami's business school, he anticipates leaving college early to focus on the company full-time, embodying a new generation of young tech entrepreneurs achieving rapid success.</p>

          <p>American farmers in the Midwest are experiencing a significant drop in exports as the ongoing trade war with China prompts Beijing to seek alternative suppliers, particularly from Brazil. This has created a divide within the agricultural community, with some farmers remaining hopeful that the Trump administration's policies will eventually secure better trade deals, while others fear the permanent loss of their largest market. The reliance on China as a primary buyer for key commodities has left many in the heartland vulnerable to geopolitical tensions. The situation highlights the precarious position of U.S. agriculture in the face of shifting global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are undergoing major economic transformations, pushing citizens from secure public-sector jobs into the private sector while also trying to attract skilled foreign workers. This shift is creating a new culture clash, as locals increasingly view foreign migrants as rivals in the labor market. Policies aimed at making these nations more attractive to expatriates, such as easing social restrictions, are also causing friction with conservative local populations. These top-down reforms are undermining the traditional social contract, where the state provided for its citizens, leading to growing unease and social tensions across the region.</p>

          <p>Germany's pension system, founded on a "generational contract" where the current workforce funds retirees, is facing an existential threat due to demographic changes. A declining birthrate since the 1970s and an aging population mean that fewer workers are supporting a growing number of pensioners, a situation set to worsen as the baby boomer generation retires. This imbalance is straining social security, increasing pressure on contributors, and making Germany less attractive for investment and skilled labor. As the government considers reforms, proposals like a special levy on wealthier pensioners are being debated, while comparisons are drawn to more stable systems in neighboring countries like Austria and the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the American Revolutionary War in a forest near Camden, South Carolina, the site of a brutal 1780 battle. The discovery, described as the "ultimate cold case," includes the remains of Continental soldiers, a British Highlander, and a Native American fighter found in shallow, hastily dug graves. A team of forensic genealogists is now working to identify the soldiers by analyzing DNA from the 240-year-old bones and building family trees. They have already created genetic profiles for two individuals and are asking potential descendants to submit DNA samples to help restore the names of these forgotten soldiers.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has clarified his pledge to stop small boat migrant crossings within two weeks of his party winning power. He initially made the promise during a keynote speech but later explained that the two-week timeline would begin only after his government passes new legislation, a process that could take months. The proposed "Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill" would grant the home secretary powers to detain and deport migrants who arrive illegally and would disapply international treaties like the Refugee Convention. Critics questioned the feasibility of the original timeline, prompting Farage to add the crucial legislative caveat to his standout policy promise.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities, led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), conducted a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai construction site in Georgia, detaining 475 workers suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The operation, described as the largest of its kind at a single site, targeted subcontractors at the new battery plant and primarily involved Korean nationals who had allegedly overstayed visas or violated work authorizations. Hyundai stated that none of the detained individuals were its direct employees but pledged to review its contractors' compliance with all laws.

          <p>In her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated that the court's decisions are not merely an "opinion poll" of the justices' personal values. Promoting her new book, Barrett argued that the court's role is to interpret what the American people have decided through the democratic process, not to impose its own beliefs. She addressed criticism surrounding the court's conservative supermajority and recent landmark rulings, including the overturning of federal abortion rights. The interview comes as the court faces a request to reconsider its 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, a topic of intense public and political debate.</p>

The dive, live-streamed to thousands, traveled over 1,500 feet below the surface, revealing the lakebed's unique geology and sub-ecosystems. The event was organized by environmental non-profits to raise awareness about the lake's ecological importance and the threats it faces from pollution and invasive species. Experts provided commentary on the 2-million-year-old lake's history and the crucial role its deep-water environment plays in its overall health, while dispelling myths about what lies beneath its surface.</p>
