          <p>Novo Nordisk is partnering with telehealth providers like Hims & Hers Health, Ro, and Life MD to offer its weight loss drug Wegovy through online platforms, aiming to increase access now that supply shortages have eased in the U.S. This move comes as compounding pharmacies face legal restrictions on creating cheaper versions of Wegovy, which had gained popularity during the shortage. The partnerships will streamline the process for patients, allowing them to access Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, NovoCare, and receive the medication at home, with Wegovy priced at $499 per month for those without insurance coverage. Hims & Hers shares saw a significant increase following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Cross necklaces are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, appearing on red carpets, social media, and even within political circles, reflecting a renewed interest in expressing Christian faith and values. The New York Times article notes that the trend is particularly noticeable among young Christian women who see the cross as a symbol of belonging and connection. Politicians and White House staff are also frequently seen wearing cross necklaces, which some interpret as a statement of faith and a reflection of Christian values in government. However, the article notes that the meaning of the cross can vary depending on individual interpretation and political affiliation.</p>

          <p>Brendan Cox, the husband of the late MP Jo Cox, is requesting a more sincere apology from the Irish rap group Kneecap after footage surfaced of them allegedly calling for the killing of MPs. Cox criticized the band's initial apology, stating it felt insincere as it suggested a conspiracy against them. Counter-terrorism police are assessing the footage, and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has suggested prosecution. Kneecap has apologized to the Amess and Cox families, rejecting any intention to incite violence against any MP or individual.</p>

          <p>Pfizer is expanding its cost-cutting efforts, projecting an additional $1.2 billion in savings by the end of 2027, primarily in selling, informational, and administrative expenses through enhanced digital enablement, automation, and AI. This is in addition to a previous cost-cutting program expected to save $4.5 billion by the end of 2025. The expanded cuts also include expected research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, the company added. These measures aim to offset declining sales, particularly from its Covid-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid, while still exceeding quarterly profit estimates.</p>

His carbon monoxide levels were normal, and he tested negative for hantavirus, but a toxicology report indicated prolonged fasting.

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the Trump administration plans to soften the impact of automotive tariffs, amidst concerns about regulatory uncertainty and additional costs for the car industry. While the 25% tariff on imported vehicles into the U.S. will remain, the new measures will prevent additional levies, such as the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, from stacking on top of existing tariffs. There will also be reimbursements for auto parts tariffs, up to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year, followed by 2.5% in the second year, before being phased out.</p>

          <p>The White House has condemned Amazon's reported plan to display the cost of President Trump's tariffs next to product prices, calling it a "hostile and political act." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon did not take similar action during the Biden administration's period of high inflation. Amazon's decision follows similar moves by Shein and Temu to highlight import charges, and it signals a potential rift between Trump and Jeff Bezos, despite Amazon's previous donations to Trump's inaugural fund and Bezos' efforts to restrict the Washington Post's opinion section.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce tariff relief for U.S. automakers during a visit to Michigan, aiming to reward companies that manufacture domestically and provide a runway for those investing in American manufacturing. The 25% tariff on finished foreign-made cars and parts will remain, but the new measures will prevent tariffs from stacking on top of other tariffs, such as steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for tariffs already paid and for tariffs on foreign auto parts, up to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year, decreasing in subsequent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent US study suggests that common chemicals found in everyday plastic products, specifically phthalates, may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality worldwide, with the most significant impact in Asia, the Middle East, and the Pacific. The study estimates that exposure to DEHP, a phthalate used to increase the durability and flexibility of plastics, could have contributed to 350,000 deaths in 2018. While the study doesn't establish a direct causal link, it suggests that reducing exposure to these chemicals by avoiding microwaving or dishwashing plastics could mitigate the risk. A global plastics treaty is currently being negotiated by the United Nations to address these concerns.</p>

          <p>Electricity has been restored to most areas of Spain and Portugal after a widespread blackout that disrupted daily life, leaving officials investigating the cause of the outage. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stated that over 95 percent of Spain's total supply had been recovered, while Portugal reported full restoration to its grid. The cause of the blackout, which affected tens of millions, remains unknown, with officials ruling out cybersecurity attacks, human error, and meteorological causes. The government has promised to investigate the incident thoroughly and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments has filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal government as unconstitutional. The plaintiffs argue that the actions taken by the president, Elon Musk, and heads of federal agencies to downsize the federal workforce exceed their authority, as Congress has not authorized such changes. The lawsuit targets Trump's executive order and the role of Musk's DOGE in directing workforce reductions, arguing that these actions usurp Congress's constitutional power to create and govern federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is projecting a 35% drop in shipping volume next week compared to last year, attributing the decline to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, which have led companies to cut import orders. Shipments from China, which make up about 45% of the port's business, are expected to plummet, with some transport companies seeking to fill their ships elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The port also expects roughly a quarter of the usual number of arriving ships to be canceled in May, signaling a significant impact on trade volume.</p>

Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks, which often have higher rates due to lower overhead costs, and exploring short-term CDs, which currently offer better interest rates than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve (not investment advice).</p>
