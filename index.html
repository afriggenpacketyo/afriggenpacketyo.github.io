            <p>Personal computer shipments experienced a notable increase in the first quarter, driven by companies accelerating deliveries in anticipation of impending tariffs. Research firms like Canalys and IDC Research estimate shipment growth exceeding 9% and nearly 5%, respectively, totaling approximately 63 million units. Businesses worldwide are preparing for the potential impacts of President Trump's tariff plans, which could significantly affect demand for computers and electronics heavily reliant on Asian manufacturing. The latest round of tariffs includes a substantial 104% levy on goods imported from China, a major hub for PC production, with Vietnam, Thailand, and India also facing import tariffs.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant rally after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs, reversing his stance from the previous week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 2,962 points, marking its best day since 2020, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also saw substantial gains. However, Trump simultaneously escalated trade tensions with China, increasing tariffs on Chinese goods from 104% to 125% in response to China's tariffs on U.S. goods reaching 84%. Despite the market rally, indices remained lower than before Trump's initial tariff announcement, highlighting ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Ackman praised Trump's approach as a brilliant execution of negotiation tactics, emphasizing the understanding of preferred trading partners and problem areas gained through the process. He had previously warned of a potential "economic nuclear winter" due to Trump's steep tariffs, urging a pause for country-specific levies. Ackman also briefly criticized Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick but later retracted his statement, acknowledging a lack of understanding of internal processes.</p>

Restraint experts have deemed the actions "brutal" and "unlawful," while the boy's mother expressed horror at the treatment. The school's management maintains that multiple investigations found no wrongdoing by staff, citing a "difference of opinion." This incident follows previous concerns about the use of calming rooms, including cases of abuse and neglect uncovered at Whitefield School in London, raising questions about the regulation and oversight of such facilities.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce a plan to increase police patrols in town centers during peak hours across England and Wales. The initiative aims to address the "postcode lottery" in policing by ensuring each community has dedicated neighborhood officers. The Labour government intends to deploy named local officers to each neighborhood and increase police ranks by 13,000 by 2029. Starmer argues that visible policing has declined significantly, leaving 90% of crimes unsolved, and that the new plan will prioritize crime prevention.</p>

            <p>President Trump's partial retreat from his radical trade agenda led to a stock market surge, but underlying economic concerns remain. While Trump lowered "reciprocal" tariffs to 10% for most countries, he escalated the trade war with China, imposing a 125% tariff on Chinese imports. Wall Street's optimism hinges on the assumption that Trump will continue to reduce tariffs, as his current policies are still more radical than the worst-case scenarios anticipated before his inauguration. Maintaining current tariffs could lead to surging prices and a heightened risk of recession, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers alike.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration cannot unilaterally remove alleged Venezuelan gang members from the U.S. without legal process, but narrowed the avenues for detainees to contest their removal. The Court held that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal, requiring them to seek review through a writ of habeas corpus. This decision comes after the administration transported approximately 260 people to a Salvadoran prison, allegedly defying a court order. The ruling raises concerns about the fate of those already incarcerated in El Salvador and the potential for hostile judicial review in conservative circuits.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has replaced Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) with Dan Driscoll, secretary of the army. This move places the ATF, responsible for enforcing gun laws, under the control of the defense department for the first time. The decision comes amid skepticism from Trump's aides regarding the ATF's mission, with discussions about potentially gutting the agency or merging it with the Drug Enforcement Administration. This change could signal a significant shift in the administration's approach to gun control and law enforcement.</p>

            <p>UK scientists claim a saliva test may help "turn the tide" on prostate cancer by analyzing men's DNA to identify those at higher risk. The test targets individuals for biopsies and MRI scans, potentially detecting aggressive cancers that would otherwise go unnoticed. While the test has not yet been proven to save lives, it offers a potential alternative to the current PSA test, which carries risks of causing more harm than good. The study showed that the test identified higher-risk tumors that needed treatment, highlighting its potential for early detection and intervention.</p>

            <p>House Republicans narrowly advanced a budget plan crucial for extending President Trump's tax cuts, which are set to expire this year, after facing opposition from within their own party. Trump pressured GOP holdouts to support the Senate-approved budget resolution, which features lower spending cuts than the House version. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Trump's priorities, including border security, defense, energy, and tax policies. The advancement marks a step forward in the reconciliation process, enabling Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority.</p>

The four main parties contesting the election are the Liberals, Conservatives, New Democrats (NDP), and Bloc Quebecois. The Liberals are currently leading in the polls after Trudeau's resignation and Trump's imposition of tariffs, shifting voter focus to responding to the US president's economic threats.</p>

The Israeli military stated it struck a "senior Hamas terrorist" responsible for planning attacks and took steps to mitigate harm to civilians. The military also accused Hamas of using the civilian population as human shields, violating international law.

            <p>Following President Trump's decision to pause reciprocal tariffs for most countries while increasing tariffs on China, right-wing commentators have struggled to justify the policy shift. Commentators like Jesse Watters and Jeanine Pirro previously promoted the "no pain, no gain" theory, insisting on the economic benefits of tariffs. Others, like Benny Johnson, downplayed the economic impact, while Larry Kudlow argued that buying cheap goods is not a sign of real prosperity. These attempts to rationalize the policy highlight the challenge of defending Trump's unpredictable and often contradictory economic strategies.</p>

            <p>More than eight years ago, celebrity hair stylist Fabio Sementilli was fatally stabbed on his Woodland Hills patio. Now, after two and a half months of court testimony, a jury must decide whether the dead man’s wife, Monica Sementilli, orchestrated his murder, or was duped by her jealous lover. Prosecutors argued that the evidence shows Monica Sementilli’s goal was to pocket $1.6 million in life insurance and avoid the complications of getting a divorce and start a new life with lover Robert Baker, a convicted sex offender and former porn star turned LA Fitness racquetball coach.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences created three fluffy white canines — Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi — unveiled this week. They are genetically modified, hybridized modern wolves, gestated in the womb of a domestic dog. Colossal claims it has created “the world’s first successfully de-extincted animal,” one “made famous from the HBO hit series Game of Thrones.” This raises questions about whether humans will change their own behavior enough to make the sacrifice of animals used in this research worthwhile by making it possible for revived endangered animals to survive in the wild.</p>
