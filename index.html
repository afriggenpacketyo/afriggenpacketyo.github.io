        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts explain how taxpayers can qualify for IRS tax forgiveness through various programs.  These include Offers in Compromise (OICs), penalty abatement, and Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status.  OICs allow settling tax debt for less than the full amount owed, while penalty abatement provides relief from additional charges.  CNC status delays aggressive collection actions until the statute of limitations expires.  Taxpayers must meet specific criteria, such as demonstrating financial hardship and maintaining current tax compliance.</p>

          <p>The US response to the Myanmar earthquake has raised concerns among current and former USAID staff due to significant budget cuts and staff reductions within the agency.  While the State Department announced plans for assistance, including funding for partner organizations, the scale of the response is significantly smaller than in previous comparable disasters.  Critics argue that the diminished capacity of USAID hinders the effectiveness of the US aid efforts and impacts the overall coordination of international relief. The reduced capacity is viewed as impacting the speed and effectiveness of the relief effort.</p>
