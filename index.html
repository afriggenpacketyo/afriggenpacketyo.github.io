          <p>Air Canada has begun preemptively canceling flights ahead of a possible strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the nation's largest airline and affect hundreds of thousands of travelers. The airline reported an unusually high number of flight attendants not reporting for work, leading to dozens of initial cancellations. The labor dispute centers on what the union calls "poverty wages" and unpaid work, while the airline states it has offered a significant pay increase. If a deal is not reached, a full strike is set to begin this Saturday.</p>

          <p>A DW investigation has debunked widespread social media claims that prominent photographs depicting famine in Gaza were staged. The fact-check verified the authenticity of images from Time Magazine and other outlets by analyzing metadata, licensing information, and the timeline of events. It confirmed the photos were taken on different days at a genuine food kitchen. The report highlights a broader disinformation narrative, termed 'Pallywood,' which seeks to discredit evidence of civilian suffering by falsely labeling it as orchestrated propaganda, undermining the work of local journalists in the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol industry is facing imminent collapse after the government decided against providing a rescue package for its two largest producers. The companies, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus, had warned that a recent US-UK trade deal removing tariffs on ethanol imports had rendered their businesses commercially unviable. The government stated that offering direct funding would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry's long-term issues. This decision places hundreds of jobs at direct risk and could impact thousands more in the agricultural supply chain.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, it confronts significant long-term financial pressures despite its crucial role in supporting nearly 70 million Americans. A key concern is the projected depletion of its trust funds by 2034, which could trigger an automatic 23% cut in benefits if Congress does not intervene. Policy debates continue over potential solutions, such as lifting the cap on income subject to payroll taxes or raising the full retirement age. These challenges have led to declining public confidence in the program's future viability.</p>

          <p>A decision by the Loudon County school board to uphold its policy allowing transgender students to use facilities that align with their gender identity has intensified the state's gubernatorial race. The board is defying a Justice Department directive that claims the policy violates Title IX, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from the Republican nominee and support from the Democratic candidate. This issue has become a central battleground for debates on parental rights, student safety, and federal oversight, echoing the themes that dominated the previous gubernatorial election in Virginia.</p>

          <h2>Series Finale of 'And Just Like That' Critiqued for Hostility Towards its Characters</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of the series finale of HBO's "And Just Like That" argues that the show concluded by leaning into its consistent theme of humiliation, often treating its characters with a sense of cruelty. The critic contends that the series strayed far from the cynical yet insightful core of its predecessor, "Sex and the City," instead focusing on cringe-worthy and superficial storylines. The review suggests the show became oddly squeamish about physicality and disconnected from reality, making it difficult for audiences to empathize with the characters' journeys in their 50s.</p>

          <p>A severe water crisis is unfolding in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are being forced to drink contaminated water to survive the scorching summer heat.

          <h2>Former Chinese Economic Official Urges Removal of Purchase Restrictions to Boost Spending</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yin Yanlin, a former high-ranking official in China's top economic policy body, has advocated for the removal of purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles to stimulate domestic consumption. Speaking at a Peking University seminar, Yin argued that enabling affluent groups to spend more freely would create a positive economic cycle of demand and income growth. He suggested that current constraints, not income levels, are the primary impediment to spending, pointing to the country's rapidly increasing household savings rate as evidence of untapped consumer potential.

          <p>Airlines are navigating an increasingly complex summer travel season as traditional demand patterns shift and consumer behavior becomes more unpredictable. Carriers are adjusting flight schedules to accommodate earlier school holidays and a growing trend of travelers opting for fall trips to Europe to avoid summer heat and crowds. This evolution, combined with rising labor costs and a tendency for last-minute bookings, is forcing airlines to be more strategic in their planning. The industry is responding by shifting peak schedules and cutting capacity to better align with these new travel habits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the recent federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department places the event within a long history of contested self-governance for the nation's capital. The article explains that since its establishment, D.C.'s autonomy has been limited by Congress, a dynamic historically rooted in partisan politics and racism. This federal oversight has often led to policies that disregard the interests of local residents, such as a past ban on funding for needle exchange programs during the AIDS crisis. The current situation is presented as a modern manifestation of this enduring power struggle.</p>

          <p>A Reddit post featuring photos of overpriced knick-knacks at a Goodwill store has sparked widespread outrage online, with many shoppers calling the pricing "ridiculous." The incident has ignited a broader conversation about the rising cost of thrifting, a practice that has grown in popularity due to economic pressures and a desire for sustainable consumption. Commenters expressed frustration that some thrift stores appear to be capitalizing on this trend by inflating prices, undermining the core appeal of affordability and accessibility that has traditionally defined secondhand shopping.</p>

          <p>The dynamic between President Trump and Vladimir Putin is taking center stage as they prepare for their summit, with Trump's tone having shifted from praise to frustration over the protracted war in Ukraine. Initially confident in their rapport, Trump has recently expressed disappointment in Putin's actions, calling him "crazy" and stating he is "not happy" with the Russian leader. This evolving relationship adds a layer of unpredictability to the talks, which will test whether their personal history can facilitate a peace deal or if the conflict has created an unbridgeable divide between them.</p>

          <p>The sixth round of United Nations negotiations aimed at creating a landmark global treaty to end plastic pollution has collapsed without an agreement. The talks were deadlocked by a fundamental disagreement between two main factions. Approximately 100 nations advocated for binding limits on plastic production to tackle the problem at its source. However, this was strongly opposed by a group of oil-producing states and major plastic manufacturers, who insisted the treaty should focus exclusively on improving recycling and waste management rather than curbing production.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally written to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, requesting the opportunity to appoint party members to the House of Lords. Farage argues that his party's performance in the last general election, where it secured over 4.1 million votes, warrants representation in the upper chamber to correct a "democratic disparity." He pointed out that other parties with fewer votes and MPs have peers, asserting that the current composition no longer reflects the UK's political landscape. The decision to grant such appointments ultimately rests with the prime minister.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decline in the percentage of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional life milestones. Compared to previous generations, fewer are getting married, having children, working full-time, or living independently from their parents. This trend is largely attributed to economic factors, including the burdensome cost of higher education, substantial student loan debt, and soaring housing prices. These financial pressures are compelling millennials and Gen Z to delay major life events that were more attainable for their parents at the same age.</p>

Reports of aggressive immigration raids and disruptive roadblocks have fueled a sense of distrust and concern among citizens, who question the necessity of the federal intervention in a city where leaders say major crime is not on the rise. The deployment has created a tense atmosphere across the capital.</p>
