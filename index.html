          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing, with a cash value of roughly $589 million, after no tickets matched all numbers in Monday's $1.2 billion drawing. This marks the sixth time in the game's 33-year history that the top prize has surpassed the billion-dollar mark, following a period of no winners since May 31. On Saturday, nine tickets matched five white balls to win $1 million, and three "power play" tickets doubled prizes to $2 million. The next drawing is on Wednesday at 10:59 p.m. ET, with tickets sold in 45 states.</p>

          <p>A minivan drove through the Kipona Festival in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, resulting in three hospitalizations, including a 6-year-old boy who is in critical condition. Two adults, a city traffic engineering department employee and a woman in a wheelchair, sustained stable injuries. The incident occurred just after 6 p.m. as the annual Labor Day weekend festival, celebrating Native American heritage, concluded. The driver is in custody, and police are actively investigating whether the act was intentional, as the vehicle traveled multiple blocks through barricaded areas before coming to a stop, causing significant front-end damage.</p>

This decision follows Israeli strikes in Gaza City that killed 13 people and comes as Israel prepares for a major offensive in the densely populated area. Prevot emphasized that the measure aims to compel the Israeli government to adhere to international and humanitarian law, while also condemning antisemitism and the glorification of terrorism by Hamas supporters.

          <p>Pickleball is experiencing a significant boom in China, with online sales of equipment skyrocketing more than six-fold this year to an average of $1.2 million monthly. This rapid growth is fueled by a broader societal shift towards active lifestyles, the influence of social media, and the recent resurgence of racquet sports. The sport's ease of learning contributes to its appeal, leading to increased court construction and structured development under the national Chinese Tennis Association. While foreign brands face unique market navigation challenges, the trend signifies a positive uptake in consumer spending on sports, reflecting a post-pandemic shift in consumer behavior.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance as investors assessed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting and continued uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. This follows a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that most of President Trump's global tariffs are illegal, though they remain in effect until a potential Supreme Court appeal. India's markets were particularly in focus after Trump claimed India offered to reduce its tariffs to zero, which he dismissed as "getting late" and a "one-sided" relationship.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in China by train to attend a military parade, marking his first visit since 2019 and potentially the first trilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The parade commemorates 80 years since the end of World War II and China's fight with Japan. Kim's presence, alongside Xi and Putin, who are often considered adversaries of the U.S., signals deepening ties between these nations. This visit occurs as U.S. and South Korean leaders express hopes for renewed talks with North Korea, which Pyongyang has so far rejected while continuing to expand its nuclear arsenal.</p>

          <p>A computer scientist is utilizing advanced facial recognition technology to analyze an image of a decomposed body, potentially resolving the nearly 50-year mystery surrounding Lebanese cleric Musa al-Sadr, who vanished in Libya in 1978. The image, obtained from a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011, showed a body resembling Sadr that appeared to have been executed. The algorithm indicated a "high probability" it was Sadr, whose disappearance significantly impacted the Middle East and spawned numerous conspiracy theories. Despite the scientific findings, Sadr's family and the political party he founded, Amal, maintain he is still alive, underscoring the enduring emotional and political power of his legacy.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, is actively advocating for improved accessibility within the Houses of Parliament, highlighting significant challenges for disabled individuals. She pointed out issues such as heavy doors, inaccessible handles, and the considerable distance to accessible toilets, along with archaic parliamentary procedures like standing to gain the Speaker's attention. While a Parliament spokesperson confirmed ongoing work and a Modernisation Committee inquiry, Tidball stresses the urgent need for more comprehensive changes to ensure Parliament accurately reflects the 22% of the voting-age population who are disabled, making it a truly inclusive space.</p>

Cleared for contact after wearing a non-contact jersey last week, Harris is now ramping up his workload and expects to play in the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs on Friday. Despite online speculation about the injury's severity, Coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed a "possibility" of Harris playing, noting his "really, really good" performance in practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are raising alarms over a surge in Vibrio vulnificus infections, a bacterial pathogen with a frighteningly high mortality rate, attributing its rise to warming coastal waters and shifting environmental conditions. Historically associated with the Gulf Coast, vibriosis cases are now occurring further north on the East Coast, with Massachusetts reporting 71 cases this year. The bacteria thrives in warm, low-salt brackish waters and can cause severe illness, including necrotizing fasciitis, through consumption of raw shellfish or open wound exposure. With a 1 in 5 fatality score, vigilance, repellent use, and broader climate action are crucial to mitigate its spread.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children unless they possess a formal deportation order. The ruling came hours after lawyers alleged a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children, with planes already prepared for departure. The Justice Department confirmed 76 children were slated for deportation but would be deplaned and returned to HHS custody. The judge deemed her "extraordinary" order justified by the government's timing during a holiday weekend, while attorneys argue the deportations skirt legal protections for minors who may face abuse or persecution upon return.</p>

After going independent from Sony Music, Odell found new success with his confessional music, particularly the TikTok-viral hit "Black Friday." His latest album, "A Wonderful Life," reflects on global uncertainties and personal anguish, but ultimately seeks peace in present-moment experiences and collaborative creation, acknowledging life's inherent tensions.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0-magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has tragically claimed over 800 lives and injured at least 2,500, devastating numerous villages, primarily in Kunar province. The shallow quake struck late Sunday, causing widespread destruction and several aftershocks, with one village reportedly "completely leveled." Rescue operations are underway, with medical teams dispatched, but the country's severe humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by severed Western ties and halted financial assistance post-Taliban takeover, is significantly hampering relief efforts. This disaster follows a 2023 temblor that killed thousands, highlighting Afghanistan's extreme vulnerability to seismic activity and its ongoing struggles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stark warning that a projected $15 trillion in U.S. investment would be "immediately cancelled" if courts invalidate his tariff policies. His statement follows a U.S. appeals court ruling that deemed his broad use of tariffs unconstitutional under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Trump asserts that without these tariffs, the American economy would face severe decline, becoming a "Third World Nation, with no hope of GREATNESS again." The tariffs are temporarily in effect pending a potential Supreme Court appeal, with the court's focus being on executive authority rather than the economic merits. (not investment advice)</p>
