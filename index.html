          <p>A Paris court has found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of criminal conspiracy related to accepting illicit campaign funds from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for his 2007 election. While he was acquitted of other charges like passive corruption, the court determined he allowed aides to seek financial support from Libyan officials. This verdict adds to a series of legal challenges Sarkozy has faced since leaving office, including prior convictions for corruption and illegal campaign financing for his 2012 re-election bid.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the popular mayor of Manchester, is openly entertaining a return to national politics, a move seen as a direct challenge to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership within the Labour Party. Burnham has discussed being contacted by MPs about replacing Starmer and has outlined a policy prospectus that diverges from the current government's fiscal caution. This creates an unwelcome distraction for Starmer's administration, drawing parallels to Boris Johnson's long-term maneuvering while he was the mayor of London.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lord Patrick Vallance, the UK's science minister, has stated that increasing the prices the National Health Service (NHS) pays for medicines is necessary to prevent pharmaceutical companies from moving their investments out of the country. His comments come after major firms like Merck and AstraZeneca either scrapped or paused significant UK projects, citing low drug prices and other systemic barriers. The government is reportedly in active discussions with the industry, facing the challenge of balancing NHS affordability with the need to remain a competitive hub for life sciences.</p>

          <p>Premiership Rugby is in discussions to hold a regular season match at the iconic Wrigley Field in Chicago, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The potential move is part of a broader strategy to increase the sport's visibility and attract investment from the United States, which is set to host the Rugby World Cup in 2031. The plan, which could happen during the 2026-27 season, is supported by the league's Chicago-based title sponsor, Gallagher, and is seen as a significant opportunity for rugby's expansion in North America.</p>

          <p>An S&P report has cautioned that China's banking sector is at risk of 'Japanification,' a term describing a prolonged period of low growth and weak profitability similar to what Japan experienced after its 1990s asset bubble burst. The warning highlights that Beijing's strategy of cutting key lending rates to stimulate the economy is squeezing banks' profit margins. The article suggests that unlike other banking systems that diversified revenue, Chinese lenders may have fewer options and will be more reliant on reducing credit losses to remain profitable.

          <p>Debbie Duncan, the mother of Jay Slater, a 19-year-old whose body was found in Tenerife after a high-profile search, has spoken out about the severe emotional toll caused by online misinformation. She revealed that during the search, social media trolls accused her of murdering her own son, creating a living hell for her family amidst their grief. Duncan is now advocating for a new law to curb harmful speculation during missing persons cases, as the coroner has officially ruled her son's death an accident without third-party involvement.</p>

Ticketmaster will now have to give 24 hours' notice if such a system is used and provide more accurate pricing details during online queues, though the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic 'dynamic pricing' in this case.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring ways to support the supply chain for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a major cyber-attack forced the carmaker to suspend all production. With JLR's factories shut until at least October, there are growing concerns that smaller suppliers who depend on its business could face bankruptcy. Among the options being considered are government-backed loans or the unprecedented step of the government purchasing component parts to ensure the financial viability of these critical firms until JLR can resume operations.</p>

          <p>Briton Chantelle Cameron has officially been elevated from interim to full WBC light-welterweight world champion. The change in status comes after the previous undisputed champion, Katie Taylor, informed the sanctioning body that she is taking time away from the sport and was subsequently named 'champion in recess.' The WBC has now ordered Cameron to make a mandatory defense of her newly acquired title against fellow British fighter Sandy Ryan, setting the stage for a major domestic showdown.</p>

          <p>In a new 'Presidential Walk of Fame' installed at the White House, President Donald Trump has chosen to represent his predecessor, Joe Biden, not with a traditional portrait but with a photograph of an autopen signing his name. This move is a direct reference to Trump's frequent and unsubstantiated allegations that Biden was not fully in command during the end of his term. The snub is the latest in a series of actions by Trump aimed at delegitimizing his predecessor and altering the traditional decorum of the White House.</p>
