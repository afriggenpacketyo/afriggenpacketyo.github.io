          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new international agreement to address Iran's nuclear program, urging for negotiations to place its activities under strict IAEA supervision. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a "nuclear disaster" following recent US and Israeli strikes. This diplomatic push positions China as a key mediator and ally to Iran, advocating for a peaceful resolution while criticizing US and Israeli actions. The call for a new framework underscores the shifting geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a formidable challenge in Group D of the Women's Euro 2025, drawn alongside top-ranked teams France and the Netherlands. Experts and statistical models have labeled it the "toughest group," with a high probability that the tournament winner will emerge from it. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, France's current form is strong, and Wales, as tournament debutants, are considered significant underdogs despite recent improvements. The group's competitive nature means every match will be critical for advancement.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have arrested the mayors of three major southern cities—Adiyaman, Adana, and Antalya—all from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). These arrests are part of a wider investigation into allegations of organized crime, bribery, and bid-rigging. This follows the recent imprisonment of Istanbul's popular mayor and detentions of numerous other CHP officials, which critics view as a politically motivated effort to weaken the opposition. The crackdown intensifies a year after the CHP made significant gains in local elections.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on Joey Chestnut's return to the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, viewing the event as a bizarre yet honest expression of American culture. It explores the intense training and dedication of elite eaters, contrasting the athletic seriousness with the grotesque nature of the spectacle itself. The author uses the contest as a lens to critique American consumerism, excess, and the nation's dysfunctional relationship with food. Ultimately, the piece interprets the event not just as a competition, but as a form of punkish satire reflecting a society of extreme consumption.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has opened designated sections of the Seine River to public swimmers. The initiative, a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, involved a €1.4 billion project to improve water quality, which had led to a swimming ban in 1923 due to pollution. Three supervised swimming zones, complete with facilities and lifeguards, have been established near landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The move is celebrated as a significant step in adapting the city to climate change and enhancing urban life for its residents.</p>

Even with some limited agreements, existing tariff levels are already increasing costs for U.S. businesses and consumers, with mid-sized firms facing an estimated $82.3 billion in additional expenses.

          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough by identifying a "genetic switch" that enables organ regeneration, successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating a specific genetic pathway, the scientists were able to trigger the complete regrowth of lost tissue, including cartilage. While human application is still a distant goal, the discovery offers hope that similar regenerative mechanisms could exist in other organs.</p>

Critics accuse the ruling Democratic Progressive Party of attempting to honor the ROC's victory over Japan while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This approach aligns with the DPP's emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from the mainland. It creates a complex political challenge, balancing the historical legacy of the ROC with a modern, Taiwan-centric national identity.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Parallels Drawn Between Trump's Governance and Cold War-Era African Dictatorships</h2>

          <p>This commentary argues that to understand Donald Trump's style of governance, one should look beyond Eurocentric analogies and consider parallels with Cold War-era dictatorships in Africa. The author points to tactics like loyalty demands, intimidation, military deployment against protesters, and anti-intellectualism as reminiscent of regimes once supported by the U.S. as bulwarks against communism. The article suggests that this authoritarian model, which the U.S. helped create abroad, is now manifesting at home. It serves as a warning that these histories also show the power of civil society to resist.</p>

          <p>The iconic Britpop band Oasis officially reunited for their first concert in 16 years, playing to an ecstatic sold-out stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The show kicked off their highly anticipated reunion tour, ending a long and acrimonious split between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher. The band performed a two-hour set filled with their classic 1990s hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger," sparking massive sing-alongs from the crowd. While the famously feuding brothers kept their interactions minimal on stage, their performance marked a momentous occasion for fans worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy. While the injury initially appeared severe, Muncy escaped with only a bone bruise and is expected to return in about six weeks, well before the playoffs. The team's front office expressed relief that the injury was not season-ending and feels confident in their internal options to cover his absence. The Dodgers will rely on players like Tommy Edman and Kiké Hernández at third base while awaiting Muncy's return.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings. Drones and lifeguards spotted sharks swimming very close to beachgoers, prompting officials to ensure public safety during the holiday. The city's emergency management used drone technology to monitor the situation, closing one section for an hour before reopening. The sightings came just days after New York state officials announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for Long Island beaches ahead of the busy holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Amid U.S. efforts to challenge China's dominance in the global shipbuilding industry, South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to step up. South Korea's new president has described the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has pledged government support to reclaim its status as a leading maritime power. The administration's policy guide focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through digitalization and improved working conditions. These moves signal a strategic effort by traditional shipbuilding powerhouses to innovate and compete in a market heavily controlled by China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-minute request to halt the deportation of eight immigrants, clearing the way for their removal to South Sudan. The case is part of the Trump administration's high-profile campaign to deter immigration, targeting individuals with serious criminal convictions. Lawyers for the men argued they would face "perilous conditions" in war-torn South Sudan, a country the U.S. government advises against travel to. The ruling marks the end of a protracted legal battle that twice reached the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A large protest in Mexico City against the negative impacts of mass tourism and gentrification turned violent, with some participants vandalizing businesses and harassing foreigners. The march, held in popular neighborhoods like Condesa and Roma, initially began peacefully with protesters demanding stricter housing laws. Tensions have been rising as an influx of "digital nomads," primarily from the U.S., has caused rents to soar, displacing local residents. The event highlights the growing backlash against the social and economic pressures created by the city's increasing popularity.</p>

          <p>On the Fourth of July, President Donald Trump signed his administration's sweeping tax and spending legislation into law. The bill introduces significant tax cuts, increases defense spending, and provides more aggressive funding for immigration enforcement. The president promoted the legislation as a catalyst for economic growth. In contrast, Democrats have strongly criticized the bill, warning that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy while potentially harming low-income earners, describing its passage as a "dark day" for the country.</p>
