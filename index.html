          <p>China and Hong Kong have initiated the Payment Connect program to streamline cross-border payments, linking the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System with Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS). This initiative aims to expedite and simplify payments and money transfers between the two regions. Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People's Bank of China, emphasized the program's significance in enhancing financial cooperation and reinforcing Hong Kong's international financial status, while Eddie Yue, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, highlighted the scheme's safety and efficiency. The program is expected to boost economic and trade cooperation, facilitate people exchanges, and promote the cross-border use of the yuan. Optimism score will be determined based on the perceived stability this brings to the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance in supermarkets, according to official figures. Sales volumes fell by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly decline since December 2023, with food retailers reporting lower sales of alcohol and tobacco. Separate data revealed an increase in government borrowing, reaching the second-highest level for May since 1993, with revenue from income tax and National Insurance contributions rising but outpaced by increased spending due to inflation-linked benefit uplifts. Economists suggest this data indicates a slowdown in economic growth after a strong start to the year, as consumers cut back on spending due to inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against the government's proposed cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the rising welfare bill but argued that cuts to personal independence payments (Pips) and universal credit should not be part of the solution. The government's bill tightens the criteria for Pips and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit, which is expected to affect hundreds of thousands of claimants and save the government billions. Other Labour MPs have expressed concerns about the bill, while government officials maintain that the reforms will support those who can work and protect those with severe disabilities. The article explains Foxcroft's resignation and the broader debate over disability benefit reforms.</p>
