        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his passing at age 91, industry experts are highlighting Giorgio Armani's visionary business strategies as being equally influential as his iconic fashion designs. Armani maintained complete control over his brand, avoiding mergers to ensure a consistent and classy vision across all his ventures, from luxury apparel to home goods and chocolates. He masterfully blended high fashion with accessible luxury, famously pioneering the power suit for both men and women, which reflected and responded to major cultural shifts like the feminist movement. His early and innovative use of celebrity endorsements, both on film and on the red carpet, was crucial in building his global, multibillion-dollar empire.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to make a significant campaign announcement, fueling speculation about his political future. The announcement follows reports that advisors to President Donald Trump are considering nominating Adams for the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent after facing low approval ratings and a since-dropped federal indictment, could alter the mayoral race dynamics if he withdraws. His departure might consolidate support for other candidates, a development President Trump has indicated he would favor to prevent a victory by the Democratic nominee, Zohran Mamdani.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing that the Department of Defense be known as the 'Department of War,' restoring a name last used in 1947. The White House stated the change aims to project a stronger message of readiness and resolve compared to the current, more defensive-sounding title. Initially, the new name will be used as a secondary title, as a permanent change requires congressional approval, which the administration will seek. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth endorsed the move, stating it reflects a shift towards an offensive mindset and a focus on raising warriors, not just defenders.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors. The authors alleged that the company used pirated copies of their books, totaling an estimated 500,000 works, to train its AI chatbot, Claude. This settlement, which awaits judicial approval, is considered one of the largest copyright recoveries ever and could set a significant precedent for legal disputes between AI developers and content creators.

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written exchange with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent ruling. Barrett explained that her direct response was warranted by Jackson's own "spirited argument" in her solo dissent on a case limiting nationwide injunctions. She emphasized that their vigorous debates are confined to the legal merits of cases and do not reflect personal animosity, quoting her mentor Justice Antonin Scalia's philosophy of attacking ideas, not people. Barrett dismissed any notion of a "beef" between them, stressing that the justices maintain collegial and friendly relationships despite their disagreements.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada is pausing its electric vehicle mandate that required 20% of new car sales to be electric by 2026, citing economic pressures from U.S. trade policies. The government will also introduce a "Buy Canadian" policy, prioritizing domestic goods for federal contracts to support local industries. This policy shift comes as Canada's economy shows signs of weakening, with a loss of 66,000 jobs in August and unemployment rising to 7.1%. While the immediate EV target is suspended, the long-term goals of 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 remain in place.</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report, which revealed an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.3% and weaker-than-expected job creation, may lead to further reductions in mortgage rates. A cooling labor market often prompts the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates to stimulate economic activity, a move that lenders have already begun pricing into their loan offers. This new data strengthens the case for a potential rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, which could cause mortgage and refinancing rates to decline even more for consumers.

          <p>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has built a national profile by suing corporations over diversity initiatives and challenging the 2020 election results, has been appointed as a co-deputy director of the FBI. An Iraq war veteran with a rapid political ascent, Bailey has been a staunch defender of Donald Trump and used his office to oppose abortion access in Missouri, even after voters approved it. His appointment comes as the FBI faces significant turnover and accusations of politicization under the Trump administration. Critics express concern that he will use his new federal law enforcement powers to advance a partisan agenda.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed an antitrust lawsuit filed by Newsmax against Fox News, though the dismissal was based on a technicality and Newsmax has been granted permission to refile. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the suit was an impermissible "shotgun complaint" because its multiple counts improperly incorporated all previous allegations. Newsmax's lawsuit accuses Fox News of monopolistic behavior, alleging it uses its market dominance to suppress conservative media competitors through intimidation tactics and by pressuring pay-TV distributors. Newsmax stated it would refile the complaint to comply with the court's order.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has become a primary target of Russian state-sponsored hate propaganda, with insults and disinformation escalating recently. Following a suspected GPS sabotage of her plane, which Bulgarian authorities linked to Moscow, Russian officials and media figures intensified their attacks. High-profile figures like Dmitry Medvedev frequently use derogatory and sexist language, often reducing her career to her past work as a gynecologist. Experts suggest the smear campaign is a response to her strong support for Ukraine, her influential position, and a broader misogynistic worldview within the Kremlin's political system.</p>

          <p>In response to the resignation of his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle to recast his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer opted for a significant shake-up, appointing new individuals to the major offices of Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. This move is seen as an attempt to seize a moment of crisis and re-energize his administration, which has faced declining approval ratings. The reshuffle is a significant exercise of prime ministerial authority, aimed at demonstrating a renewed focus on delivery and confronting a resurgent Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling in August, with the economy adding a mere 22,000 jobs, far below expectations. The unemployment rate also ticked up to 4.3%, its highest level since 2021. The report included a notable downward revision for June, which now shows a loss of 13,000 jobs—the first monthly decline since the pandemic. This slowdown is occurring as businesses adjust to widespread tariffs, with job losses seen in manufacturing and federal employment. The data suggests a worrying trend of economic stagnation and will be closely watched by the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's newly released "Master Plan IV" signals a significant strategic shift for the company, heavily emphasizing humanoid robots and autonomous robotaxis over the development of new electric cars. The document envisions a future of "sustainable abundance" enabled by AI and robotics, with little mention of new consumer EV models. This pivot aligns with CEO Elon Musk's long-stated belief that autonomous technology is Tesla's key to becoming a multi-trillion-dollar company. The plan emerges as Tesla's auto sales have slumped amid growing competition, suggesting the company is betting its future on a high-risk, high-reward move beyond its core car business.</p>

A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider such "extra-statutory requirements" while still implementing consumer protections mandated by Congress, such as ticket refunds.

          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that an accountancy administrator was unfairly dismissed for personal internet use at work, awarding her over £14,000. Her employer had used spy software and fired her after finding she spent time on sites like Amazon and Rightmove. However, the judge determined that spending less than an hour on such activities was not excessive, especially since the company had no clear policy against it and her boss also engaged in personal computer use. The judge concluded the real reason for the dismissal was the owner's desire to fire her before she reached two years of service.</p>
