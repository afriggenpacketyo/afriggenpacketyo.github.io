          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball, has passed away at the age of 89. Nagashima was renowned for his stellar performance during Japan's rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. He was a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, contributing significantly to their nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles from 1965 to 1973, and later managed the team. His popularity extended beyond sports, making him a household name alongside teammate Sadaharu Oh, fondly remembered by many older Japanese citizens. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a temporary halt to its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. An Education Department spokesperson stated the administration's commitment to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on fixed incomes. This decision marks a reversal from the administration's announcement in April that it would resume collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio, ending a nearly half-decade pause initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pause provides older borrowers with defaulted loans an opportunity to become current and avoid reduced benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a Molotov cocktail attack on a crowd of Jewish Americans in Boulder, Colorado, the Jewish community is expressing heightened fear. The attack, which injured twelve people, is part of a broader surge in antisemitic violence across the United States. Brian Levin, founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, notes that anti-Jewish hate crimes reached record levels in 2023 and 2024. The rise in violence is attributed to factors including the Israel-Hamas war and the amplification of hate speech online, leading to increased national security concerns for Jewish communities. </p>

          <p>French prosecutors are investigating a terror motive after a man shot and killed his Tunisian neighbor and wounded a Turkish man in Puget-sur-Argens, southern France. The suspect, who posted racist videos before and after the shooting, is believed to have wanted to disrupt public order through terror. Anti-terror prosecutors have taken over the investigation, focusing on the racist nature of the crime given the hateful remarks made by the killer. This incident follows other recent racist crimes in France, raising concerns about a poisonous climate and the trivialization of racist rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering allowing Iran to continue limited low-level uranium enrichment as part of a proposed nuclear deal. While the White House insists the terms of the deal are tough and prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, details suggest Iran would be allowed to develop domestic enrichment capabilities for civilian purposes only. Iran would also be required to dismantle critical infrastructure, halt new research on nuclear centrifuges, and reduce its enrichment concentration. This proposal could potentially anger Republicans and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who advocate for zero nuclear enrichment.</p>

Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. had been convicted in 2022 for theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction after they freed the animals, believing the line was illegal. The pardons erase their felony convictions, restoring their rights to vote, own firearms, and travel freely.

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge John Holcomb, cites a lack of adequate due process for those facing deportation under the 1798 law. This decision is part of a series of legal challenges to the administration's practice of deporting individuals accused of gang membership under the Alien Enemies Act. The injunction applies to migrants in custody within the Central District of California, including Los Angeles and Orange County.</p>
