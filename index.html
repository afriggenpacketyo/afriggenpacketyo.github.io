          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has strongly condemned recent U.S. airstrikes targeting alleged drug-trafficking boats, labeling them an "act of tyranny" and calling for potential criminal proceedings if Colombian citizens were killed. In an interview with the BBC, Petro questioned the necessity of lethal force, contrasting the deadly strikes with a long history of non-fatal maritime seizures in collaboration with American agencies. The Trump administration defends the actions as necessary to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., but the policy has drawn criticism from legal experts and Democratic lawmakers over its legality and proportionality.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Lula da Silva has observed that Ukrainian President Zelensky seems more open to peace talks following their recent meeting, a sentiment he also noted from Russian President Putin. Speaking about his efforts to revive a Brazil-China peace plan, Lula emphasized that the United Nations should take a leading role in mediating the conflict to regain its international authority. This diplomatic push follows a rare alignment in March where China and Brazil supported a U.S.-led ceasefire initiative at the Security Council, signaling a potential shift in negotiations.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region generally rose on Thursday, diverging from Wall Street's downward trend, which was driven by a second consecutive day of selling in major technology stocks like Nvidia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, with automaker Chery Automobile's shares surging in their debut, while South Korea's Kospi remained steady, buoyed by defense stocks. In contrast, U.S. stock futures were flat as investors awaited jobless claims data that could influence the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy decisions amid growing economic concerns.

          <p>Shares of Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, jumped 11% during their initial public offering in Hong Kong, raising approximately $1.2 billion. The successful debut occurred despite the cancellation of the formal listing ceremony due to a super typhoon, highlighting strong investor confidence in the company's expansion into European and Middle Eastern markets. Analysts note that Chery's strategy of establishing local manufacturing in various countries provides a crucial advantage, helping to mitigate the impact of steep tariffs imposed by the U.S., Canada, and the European Union on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has indicated that a government shutdown on October 1 could lead to permanent layoffs rather than temporary furloughs for some federal employees. An Office of Management and Budget memo suggests using the funding lapse as an opportunity to issue "reduction in force" notices to workers in programs not aligned with the president's priorities. This marks a significant departure from previous shutdowns and intensifies the budget standoff between the administration and Senate Democrats, who have called the threat an intimidation tactic. The move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to assert more presidential control over government spending.</p>

U.S. District Judge William Smith declared the policy "arbitrary and capricious," stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm to public safety.

          <p>Former President Barack Obama characterized the current U.S. political climate as a "tug of war" between two competing visions for the country's future. Speaking in London, he described one side as a progressive view that embraces change through democracy, while the other, championed by populists like his successor, seeks a return to a more conservative and hierarchical society. Obama was also critical of progressives, suggesting they had become "smug" and "complacent" in recent decades. He argued that their values, once taken for granted, are now being seriously tested by the resurgence of a more exclusionary worldview.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's first show back after a suspension by ABC drew an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, an audience roughly four times larger than his season average. The ratings surge came despite about a quarter of ABC's affiliate stations, including those owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, preempting the broadcast. Kimmel was suspended following his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In his return monologue, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the event and responded to President Trump's criticism about his ratings by saying, "Well, I do tonight."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" during his appearance at the United Nations, citing a series of technical mishaps. In a social media post, he detailed how an escalator carrying him and the first lady stopped abruptly, his teleprompter failed during his speech, and the auditorium's sound system was apparently off. The UN attributed the escalator stop to a videographer accidentally triggering a safety feature. Trump, however, declared the events were not a coincidence and demanded an immediate investigation into what he termed a deliberate effort to undermine his address.</p>

          <p>The man suspected of the deadly sniper attack on a Dallas ICE facility has been identified by law enforcement as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. While a motive is not yet confirmed, FBI officials reported finding shell casings at the scene engraved with "ANTI ICE" messages. Childhood friends described Jahn as largely apolitical and primarily interested in video games and internet culture, expressing shock at his actions. An online gaming profile appearing to belong to Jahn indicates he spent over 10,000 hours playing various games, with little activity on associated social media accounts in recent years.</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump to add a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications has caused alarm within the U.S. tech industry and beyond. While the White House clarified the fee currently applies only to future applicants, smaller businesses and startups argue such a cost would be crippling and prevent them from hiring skilled foreign workers. The H-1B program is vital for many sectors, including technology, education, and healthcare, which are already facing labor shortages. Critics of the policy warn it could lead to a "brain drain" and encourage companies to offshore jobs rather than hire domestically. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have made a significant breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology by designing an innovative exhaust system that effectively manages the intense heat generated within reactors. The new "Super-X divertor," tested in a U.K. government-owned facility, uses extended plasma "legs" to cool the plasma before it can damage the reactor walls, a major obstacle in making fusion energy viable. This advancement represents a crucial step toward developing clean, nearly limitless energy from nuclear fusion. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion does not produce long-lasting radioactive waste and could play a pivotal role in reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

The district attorney's office had recommended a 10-year sentence and objected to the court's decision, arguing it minimized the gravity of the crime. The case highlighted an abuse of power, leading to a $6.95 million settlement paid by the county to Morin's family.</p>

There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties. Although Venezuela is situated in a seismic region, strong earthquakes are not common, with the last major deadly event occurring in 1997.</p>

Human remains believed to be Decker's were discovered last week in a remote, mountainous area in Washington state, though local law enforcement is still awaiting final DNA confirmation. Decker, a former Army soldier with survival training, had been the subject of a manhunt since May after his daughters, ages 5, 8, and 9, were found dead from suffocation at a campsite.

The result, which Rodgers described as a "good point" for the current squad, comes after the team failed to qualify for the more prestigious Champions League. The manager's tempered expectations reflect a shift from a year ago and highlight the club's struggles after a quiet summer transfer window that saw key players depart without adequate replacements.
