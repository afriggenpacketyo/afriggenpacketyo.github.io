        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly disrupting the labor market, with overall job postings declining and entry-level positions being particularly affected. According to experts, while some tech job declines predate the widespread use of AI, there is a causal link, though perhaps not as dramatic as some headlines suggest. Economists note that while roles like coding and accounting are at higher risk, jobs requiring empathy or physicality, such as healthcare and trades, are more secure. The long-term outlook suggests that while some jobs will be displaced, AI will also create new, currently unpredictable, job categories and could lead to major societal improvements.</p>

          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the former chief of immunizations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has publicly expressed grave concerns following his resignation. He stated his departure was a protest against the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., particularly after the removal of CDC Director Susan Monarez. Daskalakis warned that the HHS and its advisory committees are moving in an ideological direction that seeks to undo vaccination progress. He believes this path will ultimately cause harm to public health, citing his duty as a doctor who has taken the Hippocratic Oath.</p>

The mission aims to challenge the Israeli blockade amid warnings of famine and catastrophic hunger affecting the Palestinian territory's population. Organizers state the convoy consists of around 20 boats with delegations from 44 countries, intended to bring food, water, and medicine. This effort follows previous attempts by activists to deliver aid, which were intercepted by the Israeli military, highlighting the ongoing crisis and the difficulties in providing humanitarian assistance.</p>

Despite a spirited performance from the Spanish side, which scored five tries, Ireland secured a bonus-point win with seven tries of their own. Key performances from Anna McGann and Grace Moore helped seal the victory, though the team suffered a setback with an injury to co-captain Sam Monaghan. Ireland will now face New Zealand to determine the top team in their pool as they move into the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>Following the Alabama Crimson Tide's 31-17 upset loss to Florida State, which snapped a 23-game season-opener winning streak, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith issued a stark warning to the team's fans. Smith suggested on social media that the dominant era of former coach Nick Saban is definitively over, pointing to issues like surrendered sacks, dropped passes, and quarterback weaknesses. The commentary reflects growing concerns about the team's trajectory under new coach Kalen DeBoer.

          <p>In a detailed personal essay, the author recounts her journey from a liberal, urban background to becoming an avid hunter in Montana, challenging the reflexive disdain for hunting often found on the political left. She argues that hunting can be a more honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat compared to factory farming, fostering a deep connection to nature and conservation. The article explores the emotional complexity of taking an animal's life, the role of hunters in wildlife management funded by firearm taxes, and the ambivalence of participating in gun culture. The author suggests that hunters and vegetarians share more common ground in their thoughtful approach to food ethics than is commonly acknowledged.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta details advancements in understanding and treating chronic pain. The article highlights the concept of "reverse translational research," which prioritizes patients' real-world experiences to guide laboratory studies, a reversal of the traditional bench-to-bedside model. This approach has led to breakthroughs, such as mapping the unique neural signatures of chronic pain in the brain for the first time. This innovation allows for the objective measurement of a subjective experience and has paved the way for treatments like deep brain stimulation to predict and interrupt pain signals.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the world is entering a dangerous new era of multipolar conflict, driven by the advancement and proliferation of ballistic missile capabilities. The author contends that, much like during the Cold War, adversaries can now hold entire populations hostage under the threat of nuclear war, increasing the likelihood of conflict, even if accidental. The piece suggests that while the nature of warfare has changed, the fundamental logic remains, and the current trajectory toward perpetual conflict is a reversible but ominous trend for global strategic stability.

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, including his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-standing political independence. Experts warn that politicizing the Fed could undermine the credibility of the U.S. financial system, which is built on the institution's ability to make unpopular but necessary monetary policy decisions. A compliant Fed board could give the president influence over interest rates, bank regulation, and the stability of the U.S. dollar, potentially leading to economic instability similar to that seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz highlights the little-known story of how surfing was introduced to the U.S. mainland in 1885 by three teenage Hawaiian princes. The royal siblings, David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui, were attending a military school nearby when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees. Their demonstration of what was then called "surfboard swimming" at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River captivated locals and planted the seeds for the sport's popularity. This act of "surf diplomacy" is now being recognized for its crucial role in bringing a royal Hawaiian tradition to American shores.</p>

Rhode Island's new surcharge, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax" after the pop star's Watch Hill property, imposes an extra fee on non-primary residences valued over $1 million. Similar measures are being implemented in states like Montana, driven by tight budgets and populist sentiment over rising housing costs.

These iconic packets, common in sushi takeaways, are made of recyclable plastic but are often too small to be processed correctly by recycling machinery, leading them to end up as waste. The ban is an extension of previous legislation that targeted items like plastic straws and carrier bags.

          <p>This true-crime report details the case of Dino Guglielmelli, a wealthy supplement company owner who was convicted of attempting to hire a hitman to murder his estranged model wife, Monica Olsen. The plot unraveled when the man Guglielmelli approached, his business associate Rick Fuhrmann, went to the police instead of carrying out the killing. Fuhrmann then cooperated with investigators, wearing a wire during a lunch meeting where Guglielmelli confirmed he wanted his wife dead for a payment of $80,000. Guglielmelli's horrific instructions included that his wife be sexually assaulted before being killed, revealing the depth of his malice during their contentious divorce.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, journalist Michael Daly reflects on the case of Alix Tichelman, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. Daly raises ethical questions about blame and accountability, suggesting that Hayes shared responsibility for his own death by arranging the meeting and asking to be injected with the drug. The author wonders if Hayes, a powerful executive, would have faced the same legal consequences as Tichelman if their roles had been reversed. The article concludes that the case is a rare one where knowing more facts makes the essential questions of culpability even less clear.</p>

          <p>This article details the investigation into the 2013 death of Google executive Forrest Hayes, who died of a heroin overdose on his yacht in Santa Cruz. The case was solved using surveillance video from the yacht, which captured his final moments with a woman later identified as Alix Tichelman. The video showed Tichelman injecting Hayes, his subsequent distress, and her failure to call for help, instead cleaning up and leaving the scene. Police ultimately arrested her after a sting operation where an undercover detective posed as a client on the same upscale dating website where she and Hayes had connected.</p>

          <p>According to Federal Reserve data, the median retirement savings for American households aged 55 to 64 is approximately $185,000, a sum that is likely insufficient for a comfortable retirement. A recent AARP survey also found that one in five Americans over 50 have no retirement savings at all. To address this shortfall, the article suggests several strategies for those looking to secure their nest egg later in life. These include consulting with a financial advisor, considering a Gold IRA to hedge against inflation, using micro-investing apps, and finding additional sources of passive income like real estate.

          <p>The Trump administration's actions, including the firing of key officials like former general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo and chair Gwynne Wilcox, have severely hobbled the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). These moves, coupled with legal challenges from major corporations like SpaceX, have left the U.S. labor watchdog without a quorum for most of the administration, rendering it unable to issue decisions and enforce the National Labor Relations Act. Critics warn that this effectively strips away federal protections for workers' rights to organize, potentially returning labor conditions to a pre-1935 state and empowering corporations to ignore labor laws without consequence.</p>

          <p>This philosophical essay addresses the common feeling of guilt or misery when experiencing personal success while the world is facing numerous humanitarian and political crises. The author draws on ancient religious and philosophical concepts that view humanity as a single body, suggesting it is moral to feel the pain of others. However, the piece argues that this shared experience should also include the joys of others, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or "freudenfreude." The author concludes that embracing both horror and delight is part of being a connected human, and allowing oneself to feel good at times can be a form of resistance.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to reform the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), raising alarms among public health experts. They warn his actions could destabilize the fragile vaccine market by exposing manufacturers to more litigation, potentially causing them to exit the market and reduce vaccine availability. Critics argue that dismantling the VICP, which was created to ensure a stable vaccine supply by providing a no-fault compensation system for rare injuries, would make it harder for genuinely injured individuals to receive financial help. This move is seen as part of Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine activism.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued a clarification that provides a crucial opportunity for consumers hoping to claim the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which is set to expire after September 30. According to the new guidance, a taxpayer can still qualify for the credit, worth up to $7,500, if they enter into a "written binding contract" and make a payment for the vehicle on or before the deadline. This means consumers do not need to take physical possession of the car by September 30, allowing those who have ordered an EV to still receive the tax break when their vehicle is delivered later.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's high-profile crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., is encountering significant hurdles in federal court, with grand juries repeatedly refusing to indict individuals arrested during the surge. In the past month, federal prosecutors have failed at least five times to secure indictments in cases involving alleged assaults on federal officers, an unusually high rate of rejection. This resistance from grand juries, which are composed of D.C. residents, suggests public skepticism toward the federal deployment. The legal stumbles, along with criticism from magistrate judges over sloppy cases, indicate the administration's law-and-order push is struggling to gain legal traction.</p>

The author contends that deploying Guardsmen for law enforcement, immigration support, or even as substitute teachers blurs the line between military and civilian authority, erodes public trust, and hollows out civilian institutions. This trend treats the Guard as a stopgap for underfunded public services, which ultimately weakens democracy.

This reversal comes despite President Trump previously calling the vaccines a "medical miracle."

According to recent analyses of news reports, India accounts for over 40% of such incidents globally, with the U.S. ranking a distant second. The most common cause of these tragedies is not animal attacks, but rather falls from heights like waterfalls, cliffs, and rooftops. Research also indicates that victims are predominantly men, and tragically, bystanders who attempt to rescue a selfie-taker often lose their lives as well, compounding the devastating consequences of a single risky decision.</p>
