          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 09:48:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel's share price experienced a downturn after President Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The call for resignation stems from concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's alleged ties to Chinese companies, some with military connections, which are seen as a potential U.S. national security risk. This political pressure comes as Intel is already implementing spending cuts and restructuring its foundry division to navigate declining sales and significant operating losses. The company has not yet commented on the president's demand.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new U.S. census that will not count undocumented immigrants, a move he announced via a post on Truth Social. The directive states the new count will be based on "modern day facts and figures" and information from the 2024 presidential election. This action represents the latest effort to alter the decennial survey, which is constitutionally mandated for apportioning congressional seats and federal funding. The announcement coincides with efforts by Texas Republicans to redraw congressional maps, which Democrats are attempting to block.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Center for Countering Digital Hate revealed that OpenAI's ChatGPT generated dangerous advice for researchers posing as vulnerable teenagers, including detailed instructions on drug use, concealing eating disorders, and self-harm. Despite having some safety warnings, the chatbot's guardrails were found to be largely ineffective and easily bypassed. OpenAI stated it is continuously working to refine its model's responses in sensitive situations and direct users to professional help. The findings raise significant concerns about the safety of AI for young users, especially given their increasing reliance on these tools.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly significantly increased its 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by massive demand for its drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. Revenue from Mounjaro reached nearly $5.2 billion, while Zepbound sales hit $3.38 billion, both exceeding analyst predictions. Despite this strong performance, the company's stock saw a premarket drop following trial results for its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, which showed slightly less weight loss than anticipated. The company's updated guidance reflects existing tariffs but not potential future levies. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the market reaction, some medical experts praised the result as a significant and clinically meaningful outcome for an oral medication, which could expand access for patients hesitant about injections. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a slight decline in the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), yet they still account for 55% of total calories in the average American diet. The study, conducted between 2021 and 2023, found that consumption is even higher among children and teenagers, at nearly 62%. These manufactured foods, often high in added fats, sugars, and chemicals, are linked to chronic diseases and rising obesity rates. The findings come as the Trump administration has expressed a desire to reduce the prevalence of UPFs in the nation's food supply.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's decision to cut its key interest rate to 4% will have varied effects on UK households, as explained in this article. For those with variable-rate mortgages, the cut could lead to lower monthly payments, though most homeowners on fixed-rate deals will not see an immediate change. Conversely, the lower rate is expected to further reduce already falling interest rates on savings accounts, diminishing returns for savers. The central bank's move is part of a strategy to manage inflation and a cooling jobs market, balancing the need to stimulate economic activity against price stability.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Dangers on Red Sea Migrant Route Following Deadly Sinking</h2>

          <p>Following a recent tragedy where at least 92 people, mostly Ethiopians, drowned crossing the Bab al-Mandab Strait, this article examines the extreme dangers of the so-called Eastern Route. Despite risks from rough waters, overloaded boats, and smugglers who force people overboard, the number of migrants attempting the journey to Yemen and onward to Gulf states is increasing. The International Organization for Migration reports that nearly 450,000 people used this route last year. The absence of an official sea rescue program, combined with the threat of piracy, means commercial ships are often hesitant to assist those in distress.</p>

          <p>Marc Agnifilo, the lead attorney for Sean "Diddy" Combs, has stated he has no involvement in any discussions with the Trump administration regarding a potential presidential pardon for his client. This clarification follows comments from another member of Combs' legal team who suggested such conversations had occurred. Combs was recently convicted on prostitution-related charges, though he was acquitted of more serious allegations like sex trafficking. Agnifilo said his focus is on sentencing for Combs, who remains in custody after being denied bail. He also defended his trial description of Combs' relationship with a key witness.</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given China a two-week deadline to provide information about redacted sections in its plans for a new large-scale embassy in London. The proposed embassy at Royal Mint Court has raised espionage and security concerns due to its proximity to the city's financial district and fears it could be used to harass political dissidents. Rayner's intervention comes after the local council initially rejected the plan, which was then resubmitted. The move signals increased government scrutiny over the project amid a complex UK-China relationship.</p>

          <p>Dean Cain, the actor best known for playing Superman in the 1990s television series "Lois & Clark," has announced his intention to become an agent with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Cain, who is already a reserve police officer and deputy sheriff, made the announcement after appearing in a recruitment video for the agency. The move comes as ICE aims to hire 10,000 new personnel to support the Trump administration's intensified deportation efforts. Cain stated he is "stepping up" to help protect the country and hopes other former law enforcement officers will do the same.</p>

          <h2>Explainer on Semiconductors and President Trump's Proposed 100% Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 08:31:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of semiconductors, or microchips, and the rationale behind President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on foreign-made imports. Semiconductors are crucial components in nearly all modern electronics, with Taiwan and South Korea being the dominant global suppliers. Trump's proposed tariff aims to incentivize companies to move manufacturing to the U.S., citing economic and national security reasons. However, the policy includes a significant caveat: companies that invest in U.S. manufacturing facilities, such as Apple's supplier TSMC and South Korea's Samsung, would be exempt from the tax.

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter results that missed earnings estimates but beat revenue expectations. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and a 3.4% same-store sales increase at Tim Hortons. However, Popeyes was a weak spot, with same-store sales declining by 1.4%. Burger King's U.S. division saw a modest 1.5% sales increase as its restaurant renovation program continues. The company reiterated its full-year forecast, maintaining its long-term growth targets through 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite plans for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a swift end to the war in Ukraine remains unlikely due to the vast differences in their positions. Russia's demands for a settlement, which include Ukrainian surrender of several regions and demilitarization, are fundamentally unacceptable to Kyiv. This analysis suggests Putin may be engaging in dialogue to fend off further U.S. sanctions or to persuade Trump of his position. Meanwhile, Ukraine is concerned that a bilateral meeting could result in the U.S. conceding to Russian demands without its participation.</p>

          <p>In a closely divided decision, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted 5-4 to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.0%. The move reflects the central bank's challenge of balancing persistent inflation, which rose to 3.6% in June, against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. The committee was initially split, with some members favoring a hold and one advocating for a larger cut, before a second vote secured the majority for the reduction. The bank reiterated that its approach to further monetary easing will remain "gradual and careful." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's vital semiconductor industry is facing significant pressure from a U.S. proposal to impose a 100% tariff on imported chips unless companies establish manufacturing operations in the United States. This threat follows a separate 20% U.S. tariff on a range of Taiwanese goods that has already taken effect. While the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, appears exempt due to its major investments in Arizona, the policy is expected to force other firms in Taiwan's extensive tech supply chain to consider costly relocations to the U.S. to maintain market access.

This diplomatic outreach is seen as a pragmatic move by New Delhi to secure its strategic interests in the region, including trade routes and stability, and to ensure it is not sidelined in post-war reconstruction.
