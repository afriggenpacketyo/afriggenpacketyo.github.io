            <p>President Trump's administration is moving forward with substantial tariffs on China, with rates set to increase to 104%. Trump dismissed the possibility of pausing tariffs for negotiations, stating that many countries are seeking deals with the U.S. He also threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for tariffs and to impose additional tariffs on China for retaliatory measures. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes China is at a disadvantage in this trade escalation due to the imbalance in export volumes between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

Aid has reportedly dried up, and civilians are trapped in an endless death loop, according to Guterres. Six UN agencies have jointly appealed to world leaders to ensure urgent delivery of food and supplies to Palestinians. Israel insists there is enough food in Gaza, but UN agencies refute this claim. The blockade, initiated after a ceasefire expired, has led to renewed aerial bombardments and ground offensives.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration's right to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Federal officials frame the gang as a national threat, but experts argue this is overstated. The government relies on clothing and tattoos for identification, which experts say are unreliable. Criminal cases are clustered in states with large Venezuelan migrant populations, and victims are often other Venezuelan migrants.</p>

Housing watchers had hoped for a boost to the spring market, but high home prices and economic concerns continue to affect buyer confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump touts falling oil prices and borrowing costs as positive signs of his tariff policy, but experts disagree, saying these trends indicate expectations of an economic slowdown. Lower oil prices and Treasury yields are seen as a result of concerns about economic growth, which would reduce energy demand and drive investors to safe-haven assets. While these factors may provide some near-term relief for consumers, they are unlikely to offset the potential economic pain caused by the tariffs. The administration has largely declined to rule out the possibility of a recession. (not investment advice)</p>
