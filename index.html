        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities, some experts believe Iran may pursue a more secretive and aggressive path toward nuclear weapons. Tehran has responded by halting cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, raising concerns it might withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This move prevents independent verification of its nuclear program's status, creating a "fork-in-the-road" moment that could heighten regional and global tensions. Without IAEA monitoring, the international community faces uncertainty about Iran's ability to rebuild and the direction of its nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>A Cessna 208B aircraft carrying skydivers went off the runway at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring all fifteen people on board. The injured were transported to a local hospital with varying degrees of severity, though none were reported as life-threatening. The FAA is investigating the incident, and it was revealed that the same aircraft was involved in a previous runway incident in 2023. In that event, the NTSB determined the cause was an "inadequate landing flare" by the pilot.</p>

          <p>The Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73, is critically endangered due to the crashing population of its primary food source, Chinook salmon. Conservationists are concerned that proposed changes by the Trump administration to the Endangered Species Act could worsen the situation. The proposal aims to change the definition of "harm" to exclude habitat damage, potentially opening protected areas to industrial development. This could undermine habitat revitalization projects essential for the survival of both the salmon and the orcas that depend on them.</p>

A jury found that David Walls-Kaufman, a Capitol insurrectionist, had assaulted Officer Smith during the riot, contributing to the trauma his widow says led to his death. Following her husband's death, Erin Smith has become a powerful advocate, successfully lobbying for a law recognizing some police suicides as line-of-duty deaths.

          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's major tax and spending bill ahead of a July 4 deadline. The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, faces opposition from multiple GOP factions in the House, including the conservative Freedom Caucus and moderate members. Key disagreements center on the bill's impact on the national deficit and the severity of cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food subsidies. With a slim majority, Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump are actively working to persuade holdouts, but the bill's final passage remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, claimed his former lover and co-defendant, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker insisted that Fabio's wife "didn't know s***" about the murder plot and that he acted alone out of a desire to be with her. This claim comes as Monica Sementilli faces her own trial for conspiracy. Baker, who is serving a life sentence, was reluctant to discuss many details but remained firm on her alleged innocence, a point her defense team may leverage in her upcoming trial.</p>

Key evidence included records of their affair, Monica's actions on the day of the murder to establish an alibi, and testimony from Baker's accomplice. Despite Baker testifying that Monica was not involved, the jury sided with the prosecution, and she has been sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

The move by UPenn came in response to a directive from the Trump administration regarding Title IX.

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials has issued a stark warning that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could have devastating health consequences for Americans. The proposed 2026 budget would slash the CDC's funding by over half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion, impacting everything from chronic disease prevention to local health departments that rely on federal support. The officials stressed that these cuts would damage successful, life-saving programs targeting issues like HIV, tobacco use, and injury prevention, ultimately leading to more illness and unnecessary deaths across the country.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's latest intelligence assessment suggests that recent U.S. airstrikes have set back Iran's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This evaluation is more measured than President Trump's initial claims of complete obliteration but is an upgrade from an earlier, low-confidence report that estimated a setback of only several months. The new assessment is reportedly based on material showing the destruction of centrifuges at key enrichment sites. The actual extent of the damage remains crucial for determining how long Iran's path to a potential nuclear weapon has been delayed.</p>

As part of the deal, Vietnam will reportedly eliminate tariffs on U.S. products, granting American goods full market access.

The article points out that Medicaid provides essential care for many of the chronic diseases Kennedy aims to combat.

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that the housing affordability crisis, long associated with coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles, is now firmly taking hold in the Sun Belt. Cities such as Phoenix, Miami, and Atlanta have seen median home prices rise dramatically over the past decade, with housing production rates falling significantly. This trend challenges the conventional wisdom that the Sun Belt acts as a pressure-release valve for overpriced coastal markets. As these once-affordable regions adopt more restrictive zoning and face the limits of urban sprawl, the entire country is beginning to resemble California's challenging housing landscape.

          <p>Saudi boxing official Turki Alalshikh has suggested that former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury will come out of retirement for a fight in 2026. In a social media post, Alalshikh stated he has Fury's "word to have him in Riyadh season in 2026," adding, "We have a rabbit to hunt," a likely reference to Oleksandr Usyk. Fury, who retired in January after losing a rematch to Usyk, fueled the speculation by posting a photo with Alalshikh and the caption, "Let's see what 2026 brings." The boxer has also expressed interest in a potential all-British showdown with Anthony Joshua.</p>
