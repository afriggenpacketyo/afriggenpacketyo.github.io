          <h2>PepsiCo Adjusts Earnings Outlook Amid Tariff and Spending Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 06:15:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo reported mixed quarterly results, with international sales partially offsetting weaker North American demand. The company has lowered its earnings forecast, citing expected volatility from global trade developments, new tariffs, and cautious consumer spending. CEO Ramon Laguarta anticipates increased supply chain costs due to these factors, and the company's shares experienced a slight dip in premarket trading as a result of the adjusted forecast. The company reported first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $1.83 billion, or $1.33 per share, down from $2.04 billion, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier.</p>

          <p>A deadly Russian attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least nine deaths and dozens of injuries, marking the deadliest strike on the city since 2024. Ukrainian officials report that cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic weapons were used in the assault, targeting residential areas and other districts. President Zelenskyy, currently in South Africa, is cutting short his trip to return to Ukraine following the attack, and he emphasized the need for the world to understand the reality of the situation. The attack occurs amid intensifying negotiations to end the war, with the White House pressuring Zelenskyy to consider a peace plan potentially involving ceding land to Russia.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is visiting South Africa in a move to strengthen diplomatic ties and counter Russia's influence in Africa. This visit signals a shift in relations between the two nations and highlights Ukraine's efforts to gain international legitimacy beyond Europe, especially as its relationship with the U.S. faces challenges. However, Russia disrupted Zelensky's visit by carrying out an air strike on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, forcing him to announce that he will cut short the trip. The visit is also significant for South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, who faces pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a deadly airstrike on Kyiv, resulting in casualties, as the Trump administration pressures Ukraine to accept a peace plan that favors Russia. The attack, one of the deadliest in recent years, prompted President Zelenskyy to cut short his trip to South Africa and return to Kyiv. Trump has criticized Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia and has threatened to withdraw from peace talks if they take too long. Zelenskyy responded by noting that emotions are high, but he remains hopeful for a lasting peace and linked to a declaration from the first Trump administration supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

Ultimately, the advice emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, surrounding oneself with diverse perspectives, and continually assessing whether one is still able to do good.</p>

          <p>Armed groups caused widespread disruption across Mexico by torching vehicles and blocking roads, signaling an escalation in the turf war between the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel and local criminal organizations. The violence, which included seizing and burning cargo trucks on a major highway, is reportedly a reaction to military operations in the area. The Jalisco New Generation cartel, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., has been accused of using deceptive recruitment tactics and brutalizing those who resist. The group is led by Nemesio Rubén "El Mencho" Oseguera Cervantes, for whom the U.S. government has offered a $15 million reward.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is warning of "serious consequences" regarding Russia's plans to establish a naval base in Sudan, a move that could significantly expand Russia's presence in Africa. This development has triggered concern from the State Department, which is urging Sudan to avoid transactions with Russia's defense sector. Analysts suggest that Russia views Sudan's strategic location as key to expanding its influence in Africa and potentially countering U.S. and Chinese presence in the region. The proposed base also raises security concerns regarding control over vital shipping lanes like the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that economic nostalgia often leads to detrimental policies, drawing parallels between the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trump-era tariffs. Both instances, driven by a longing for a romanticized past, resulted in negative economic consequences, including trade wars and harm to the very sectors they aimed to protect. The author asserts that economies are dynamic and attempts to freeze them in place with trade barriers ultimately hinder progress and create more pain. The piece concludes by advocating for embracing change and creative destruction rather than resisting it.</p>

The potential reductions could limit the city's ability to monitor traffic control, respond to emergencies, and maintain infrastructure, ultimately impacting the safety and mobility of residents and visitors.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering implementing regional pricing for power, which could result in discounted energy bills for homes located near energy infrastructure. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband confirmed that the government is exploring options to shake up the energy market, including zonal pricing. Regional pricing is used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden. This could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation than households in South. However, critics argue that this could result in higher energy costs for some Britons.</p>
