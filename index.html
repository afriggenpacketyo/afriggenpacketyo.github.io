            <p>Scotland is under an extreme wildfire warning for one last day, with rain expected to alleviate conditions. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is actively managing ongoing wildfires, including those on the Isle of Arran and in Acharacle in the Highlands, urging public caution. Police have also restricted access to areas affected by a wildfire on the Isle of Bute. This warning follows a prolonged period of unseasonably dry weather, with temperatures soaring above the April average, leading to multiple wildfires across Scotland this week, impacting areas from Thurso Moors to the Pentland Hills.</p>

            <p>Beijing faced severe disruptions as high winds and sandstorms prompted the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closure of public parks. The city's two major international airports, Beijing Capital and Daxing, canceled 693 flights, and warnings were issued for continued violent weather. The Universal Studios theme park and historical sites, including the Forbidden City, were closed, and outdoor events were suspended. These weather conditions, generated in China's dry north, reduce visibility and cause discomfort, prompting the government to advise residents to stay indoors and cancel outdoor activities.</p>

            <p>A study reveals that British slang is increasingly popular in American English, especially among Gen Z, driven by social media and streaming services. Words like "bonkers," "cheeky," and "snarky" are gaining traction, with researchers noting that cultural globalization and access to UK media are key factors. While some worry about the Americanization of British English, the influx of Britishisms is generally welcomed in the US, seen as enriching and aerating the language. This trend highlights the evolving nature of language and the increasing interconnectedness of cultures.</p>

            <p>This article argues that Congress should reclaim its constitutional power to levy tariffs, which has been ceded to the executive branch, leading to economic instability. President Trump's use of tariffs is criticized as erratic and kinglike, creating uncertainty for businesses and inviting corruption. The author contends that Congress must act to cancel or legitimize existing tariffs and clarify the president's limited power to impose new ones. By reasserting its authority, Congress can restore stability and prevent the president from unilaterally disrupting the American economy.</p>

            <p>The U.S. is cracking down on imports from Vietnam due to concerns that China is using the country as a conduit to evade tariffs. As the U.S.-China trade war escalated after 2018, Vietnam's exports to the U.S. increased, suggesting some Chinese products were rerouted to avoid higher tariffs. While much of Vietnam's manufacturing growth is value-added production, a portion is attributed to rerouting, prompting potential adjustments to international supply chains. The U.S. may impose higher tariffs on Vietnam based on its trade surplus, reflecting concerns about China's indirect trade practices.</p>

            <p>The core debate surrounding President Trump's tariff war centers on the balance between preserving American jobs and providing affordable goods to consumers. While tariffs could potentially safeguard jobs in specific industries by reducing imports, they also raise prices for American consumers. Economists note that regions heavily exposed to import competition from China have experienced manufacturing job losses. However, tariffs, while potentially preserving jobs, come at the cost of consumers paying higher prices for foreign goods.</p>

            <p>Severe gales in Beijing and northern China have led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and suspension of train lines. Wind gusts reached up to 93mph, the strongest in the capital in over half a century, prompting the closure of parks and historic sites. Authorities urged residents to stay indoors, leading to deserted streets and some property damage. The strong winds are attributed to a cold vortex system over Mongolia, with conditions expected to improve by Sunday.</p>

            <p>An immigration judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student activist with permanent residency, can be deported from the US. Khalil, a postgraduate student at Columbia University, has been a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests. The Trump administration argues that his participation in demonstrations expressing views considered antisemitic justifies his expulsion. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal the ruling, arguing it violates his right to a fair hearing and suppresses dissent. Protests have erupted over his arrest, with critics denouncing the administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that migrants facing deportation have the right to a hearing before being removed from the United States. The rulings this week put a check on President Trump's power to arrest and quickly deport people alleged to be members of foreign crime gangs. The court did not rule on the president’s broad claims of wartime power to deport “alien enemies.” However, the justices agreed that all those facing deportation have a right to a hearing.</p>

            <p>Biotechnology company Colossal Biosciences announced the "de-extinction" of the dire wolf, creating pups genetically engineered to resemble the extinct species. However, experts at La Brea Tar Pits, home to a vast collection of dire wolf fossils, are skeptical, arguing that the pups are genetically engineered gray wolves rather than true dire wolves. While acknowledging the impressive technology, they believe the term "de-extinction" is misleading. This announcement has sparked a debate about the ethics and goals of de-extinction efforts versus conservation of existing endangered species.</p>

            <p>Farmers in the United States are expressing concerns over China's imposition of steep tariffs on U.S. exports, which is making life more expensive for them. Tariffs not only affect the cost of farm supplies but also increase the risk of retaliation against U.S. crop exports. The White House is considering ways to help farmers, but memories of market loss during Trump's first term trade wars remain. Farmers emphasize that they prefer markets over government aid, as they seek to sell their grain at a profit.</p>

            <p>A three-year legal battle over the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with health problems and mental disabilities, has concluded with a jury finding no liability on the part of five former corrections officers. Givens was found dead in his cell in 2022, and his sister sued, alleging that the officers participated in a savage beating. The defense argued that Givens died from a seizure and a fall in his cell. The case has raised broader questions about conditions at the specialized facility in southwest Virginia.</p>
