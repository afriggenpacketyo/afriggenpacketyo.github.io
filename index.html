          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of hundreds and injuries to many more, with villages significantly damaged or destroyed. The earthquake occurred near the Pakistan border, with the majority of casualties reported in Kunar Province. Rescue efforts are underway, with support teams dispatched from nearby provinces and international agencies coordinating relief efforts. Communication blackouts and poor cell service coverage are hindering access to some of the affected regions, complicating rescue operations. The disaster comes as the country continues to face a humanitarian crisis amidst political isolation and economic hardship, hindering the scale of the relief effort. The general sense of the article is one of tragedy and urgency. </p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) continue to offer competitive interest rates, although they have declined from recent peaks, and further decreases are possible if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Experts suggest that short-term CDs, particularly those with six-month terms, currently offer the most attractive rates. Medium-term CDs, such as one-year options, may also provide solid returns. A CD ladder, which involves investing in multiple CDs with varying terms, can be a smart strategy to balance returns and liquidity, allowing savers to secure higher rates while ensuring access to funds at regular intervals. The financial outlook for CDs remains positive.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joe Bugner, a former heavyweight boxer who held British and Commonwealth titles and faced Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, has died at the age of 75. Throughout the 1970s, Bugner was consistently ranked among the world's top 10 heavyweights, known for his technical ability and toughness. Born in Hungary, Bugner's family fled to the United Kingdom after the 1956 Soviet invasion, and he began boxing as a teenager, winning the ABA light heavyweight title. After retiring multiple times, he moved to Australia and later won the Australian heavyweight title and the World Boxing Federation heavyweight championship before retiring for good in 1999.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed to Russian President Vladimir Putin that India aims to deepen cooperation across all sectors, signaling that New Delhi would not reduce crude oil imports from Russia. This stance comes despite pressure from the U.S., which has reportedly led to the cancellation of plans for President Trump to visit India later this year. Putin is scheduled to visit India in December for the annual bilateral summit, continuing a tradition of regular dialogue between the two countries' leaders. The relationship between India and Russia remains strong. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy showed a 57% greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to users of tirzepatide, according to new trial data. This is positive news for the company, which has been facing challenges in the U.S. market, including increased competition and uncertainty around White House tariffs. Analysts suggest the heart-protective benefits of Wegovy could be a potential game changer for Novo Nordisk, though the market reaction has been cautiously optimistic. The company has been working to combat copycat treatments and focus on direct-to-consumer sales. </p>

Experts recommend focusing on minimally processed foods and being an informed consumer by checking ingredients for corn syrup, preservatives, and other additives.

Physical gold, like coins and bars, is recommended for those prioritizing stability over growth potential, while gold ETFs offer liquidity and diversification without storage hassles. Gold mining stocks can potentially outperform in inflationary environments but carry higher risk due to company-specific operational challenges. Investors should consider their goals, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance before deciding on the best gold investment option, with experts generally advising a gold exposure of 5% to 10% of a total portfolio.

From April to July, the average price of goods imported from China dropped 2.4% against an effective tariff increase of 27 percentage points.

          <p>Despite a crackdown and recent deadly riots, hundreds of students continue to protest across various cities in Indonesia. The protests were sparked by the government enhancing perks for lawmakers, including housing allowances significantly higher than the minimum wage. Unrest escalated after footage emerged of a police team running over a delivery driver. President Subianto has revoked some of the perks for lawmakers and canceled his attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in China. The protests have impacted financial markets. </p>

          <p>ScotRail has eliminated peak rail fares, allowing passengers to travel on busy weekday trains without paying higher prices. The aim is to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, offering significant savings on routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow. A pilot scheme scrapping peak-time fares had previously been introduced but ended due to unsustainable costs, but First Minister John Swinney reinstated the policy. The Scottish government expects the scheme to lead to a "huge saving" for individuals and is funding the initiative through the ScotRail budget. The article discusses the benefits of the new policy. </p>

          <p>A certified financial planner and personal finance reporter outlines strategies for managing rising medical expenses, emphasizing the importance of carefully selecting health insurance plans. Many individuals spend minimal time choosing a plan, potentially leading to costly mistakes. Tracking annual out-of-pocket healthcare costs, including co-payments and prescriptions, is essential for finding the right plan and determining flexible spending account (FSA) contributions. Leveraging a health savings account (HSA) can also provide long-term savings for medical expenses. The financial outlook is cautiously optimistic.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health initiatives, such as the "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, share similarities with Michelle Obama's "Let's Move!" campaign, including targeting processed foods and promoting healthier lifestyles. While Kennedy has been more direct in identifying the food industry as a root cause, the strategy of pressuring companies to alter products, rather than introducing new regulations, mirrors Obama's approach. Both campaigns have faced challenges in achieving significant, lasting reforms due to the food industry's influence and consumer preferences. There are questions about the effectiveness of the current strategy. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The idea of scrapping public holidays to improve economic productivity is being debated in several countries. While some argue that fewer holidays can boost GDP, studies suggest that the impact is limited and that other factors, such as labor efficiency and capital investment, play a more significant role. There are also counter-arguments that days off increase worker well-being and productivity in the long term. The US stands out as the only OECD country without statutory leave, while countries with more combined days off often have high GDP per capita. The article discusses the various sides of this debate. </p>

          <p>Labor advocates are expressing concerns about the Trump administration's policies, claiming they prioritize corporate interests over workers' rights. Despite promises to fight for workers, Trump has taken actions that hurt workers, such as halting enforcement of miner safety regulations and stripping federal workers of collective bargaining rights. Advocates argue that Trump's policies, including tariffs and deportations, are harming US workers. The administration disputes these criticisms, asserting that Trump has championed an agenda that puts American workers first. The debate over worker welfare continues. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Utah has emerged as an unexpected battleground in the national redistricting effort after a judge tossed out the state's current congressional map. The ruling, prompted by a gerrymandering challenge, requires the Republican-led legislature to submit a new map that could consolidate Salt Lake City into one district, potentially giving Democrats an opening. This decision contrasts with efforts in other states, like Texas, where Republicans are openly seeking to solidify their political advantage through redistricting. The Utah case stems from a voter-approved initiative to ban partisan gerrymandering. The fairness of the new system is up in the air. </p>
