          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, signaling a thaw in trade tensions. The U.S. administration, under President Trump, reduced tariffs imposed on the Asian economy to 30% from 145%, while China lowered its retaliatory tariffs on the United States to 10% from 125%. Both countries will retain a portion of their tariffs, with further negotiations planned during the 90-day pause, and have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns. The article notes Trump's remarks about a "breakthrough agreement" and the upcoming bilateral talks aimed at solidifying the future trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have documented wild chimpanzees in Uganda utilizing medicinal plants in various ways to treat open wounds and injuries. Researchers from the University of Oxford, in collaboration with a local team, filmed and recorded instances of chimpanzees applying plants for first aid, both on themselves and on each other. This research expands on previous findings that chimps consume specific plants for self-medication. The scientists also compiled decades of observations to create a catalog of the different ways in which chimpanzees use "forest first aid", adding to the evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild, and suggesting the capacity for empathy.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as ultra-high-net-worth individuals seek personalized wealth management services, but these offices are struggling to find qualified money managers. The article highlights that trust is a key criterion for family offices when hiring, often outweighing other qualifications. Family offices also face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. Some young employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of a clear corporate structure and the perception that they are "risky" or "retirement" jobs, so family offices must step up their game to pursue the talent they want.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has announced he will lift sanctions on Syria ahead of a planned meeting with its interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, during his Middle East tour. The lifting of sanctions, which previously blocked foreign financing and aid, was met with celebration in Damascus. Trump stated that the policy change would give Syria "a chance at greatness," while Syria's Foreign Minister hailed the decision as a "pivotal turning point." Al-Sharaa has been advocating for the end of sanctions and the delisting of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization, despite concerns over past violence against minorities.</p>

          <p>China has reasserted its territorial claims near its contested border with India by publishing "standard" names for dozens of places in Arunachal Pradesh, a region China claims as part of the Tibetan autonomous region. This move comes despite recent efforts to improve diplomatic ties between the two countries after a period of tension. The Ministry of Civil Affairs assigned names in Chinese characters, Tibetan, and pinyin, along with detailed coordinates and maps, for 27 geographical features. This action follows a deadly military clash in 2020 and a subsequent military standoff, although China and India agreed to end their military standoff late last year.</p>

          <p>In negotiations with American representatives, Iranian officials proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments, as an alternative to dismantling its nuclear program. According to Iranian officials, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and then shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. While the idea is new and untested, analysts suggest it may be a necessary shift from maximum zero-sum demands to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>

          <p>A UNICEF report indicates that children in Japan continue to struggle with poor mental health, ranking 32nd among 43 developed and emerging nations, primarily due to high suicide rates. While Japan improved from 37th in 2020, its youth suicide rate remains the fourth highest among wealthy states surveyed. The country ranked first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills, contributing to an overall ranking of 14th. Experts suggest there is limited awareness of children's mental health issues in Japan, rendering government measures ineffective. The report also notes the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's academic performance and mental and physical health.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team inadvertently opened the door for prosecutors to introduce new evidence related to a prior dispute with her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in the weeks leading up to his death. The defense's introduction of text messages between Read and another man has allowed the prosecution to argue that Read's actions and state of mind leading up to O'Keefe's death were indicative of a "domestic violence homicide." The prosecution now plans to present testimony about an incident in Aruba where Read allegedly became enraged with O'Keefe for speaking to another woman. The prosecution claims this incident is relevant to show Read's intent and state of mind towards the victim.</p>

Buttigieg, who is rumored to be considering a 2028 presidential run, emphasized the importance of the Democratic party meeting people where they are and avoiding a return to the status quo.

Countries and universities worldwide are offering incentives, including funding and academic freedom, to lure American scientists. While salaries may be lower in Europe, factors such as social security and free healthcare can compensate for the difference, making these offers appealing to researchers considering leaving the United States.</p>

The overall U.S. messaging, which treated India and Pakistan on equal terms and offered to mediate on Kashmir, has left Indian political leaders vulnerable to criticism.</p>

          <h2>State Farm Approved to Increase Home Insurance Rates in California Following Wildfires</h2>

          <p>State Farm will be allowed to temporarily charge an extra 17 percent for homeownersâ€™ insurance policies in California, after the state gave the company permission, in the wake of the catastrophic fires. The insurer will be allowed to charge the higher rate at least until a hearing later this year, the state announced on Tuesday. The insurance giant already received a 20 percent rate increase last year, a move that a consumer watchdog group, as well as homeowners struggling to be paid after their homes were destroyed in January in the Los Angeles fires, criticized as unfair and unfounded. The increase is a compromise and will be challenged again at a hearing this fall.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the potential deployment of French nuclear weapons elsewhere in Europe, under specific conditions. Macron emphasized that France would not cover the security costs for other nations, and its own defense capabilities must remain intact, with the French president retaining sole control over the weapons. The proposal comes as many European leaders feel they can no longer rely on the U.S.' nuclear commitment to Europe amid concerns of the Russian threat. Germany and other Eastern European countries have expressed interest in the possibility, but stress that this is not a substitute for the U.S. nuclear guarantee.</p>

Some Israeli military officials have warned their commanders that many areas of Gaza will run out of food, leading to a humanitarian crisis. The analysis contrasts with Israel's public stance, which has maintained that the blockade did not pose a major threat to civilian life. Aid groups have warned that most bakeries and charity kitchens have shut down, and the UN's World Food Program has run out of food stocks.</p>
