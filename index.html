            <p>A new preprint study from Cleveland Clinic indicates a possible correlation between the flu vaccine and a higher risk of influenza infections among working-aged adults during the 2024-2025 season. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found a 27% increase in flu infections among vaccinated employees. Medical experts caution against misinterpreting the results, noting that the study is observational and doesn't account for healthcare workers' increased exposure to the flu.
