          <p>Rod Stewart has canceled several US concerts due to recovering from the flu, ahead of his scheduled performance at the Glastonbury Festival later this month. The cancellations include four dates in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, with another two shows in California being rescheduled. Stewart, who is set to play the legends slot at Glastonbury, expressed his apologies to fans for any inconvenience caused. He had previously mentioned plans to scale back large-scale world tours after 2025 in favor of more intimate venues, but remains enthusiastic about his upcoming Glastonbury performance where he will be joined by former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood. The singer is scheduled to play for an hour and a quarter on the Pyramid Stage and has requested an additional 15 minutes. The rockstar is expected to make a full recovery. His performance will be a Sunday teatime slot. The score is based on the fact that he is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

          <p>A report by the Norwegian Refugee Council highlights Cameroon as facing the world's most neglected displacement crisis, marked by insufficient political and media attention, and underfunded aid efforts. Over 1.1 million people are internally displaced, alongside 480,000 refugees primarily from the Central African Republic, due to two main conflicts. One conflict involves a civil war in western Cameroon, rooted in historical divisions, where radical forces seek secession. The other is the intensification of Islamist militant activity in the Lake Chad region. The lack of renewed political, humanitarian, or media attention suggests a bleak outlook for Cameroon in 2025, compounded by budget cuts in development and humanitarian aid from major countries. The article discusses the challenges and the need for improved security and regional cooperation. The score is based on the fact that this is a crisis with little hope for the future.</p>

          <p>A series of surprise raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in downtown Los Angeles triggered protests and strong reactions from elected officials, who condemned the actions as cruel and unnecessary. The raids led to the arrest of 44 people for administrative violations and one for obstruction, with federal agents executing search warrants related to harboring individuals without legal residency. Protests erupted in the Fashion District, with demonstrators clashing with federal agents who used flash-bang grenades and pepper spray to disperse the crowds. The president of SEIU California, David Huerta, was injured and detained while documenting a raid, further fueling the outrage. The article discusses the aftermath of the raids, including the response from community leaders and elected officials, as well as the broader context of increased immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.

          <p>A federal judge has granted final approval to a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay athletes. The settlement permits schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion for former players who were previously barred from receiving revenue. Payouts will be determined by sport and career length, with some football and basketball players potentially receiving nearly $135,000 each. The agreement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, and it also calls for a clearinghouse to ensure that NIL deals are pegged at fair market value. The article highlights the end of amateurism and the beginning of direct payment to athletes, as well as the regulation of NIL deals. The settlement provides a positive change for college athletes.</p>

          <p>Iran has strongly criticized the U.S. travel ban on Iranians and citizens of 11 other predominantly Middle Eastern and African countries, labeling it a sign of a racist mentality. The executive order, signed by President Trump, revives restrictions justified on national security grounds after a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado. The Iranian foreign ministry official Alireza Hashemi-Raja stated that the ban violates international law and deprives millions of the right to travel based on nationality or religion. The article discusses the impact of the ban on Iranians living in the U.S. and highlights the strained relations between Iran and the U.S. since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The ban is discriminatory and the score reflects the negative impact of the ban.</p>

          <p>MI5 misled its watchdog, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), about its handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent after providing false information in court. IPCO had to rewrite a report after MI5 gave it false information. MI5's actions effectively gave false evidence to every organization or court that is supposed to have access to the Security Service's secrets and is responsible for holding it to account. MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements to the courts. The fact that MI5 lied is not a positive event.</p>

          <p>Devi Sridhar argues that achieving a long and healthy life requires more than individual optimization through diet and exercise. Public health policies, infrastructure, and community play a significant role in determining health outcomes and longevity. The focus on personal responsibility distracts from the impact of public policy and community in affecting our health chances and longevity. The author suggests supporting policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water. The focus on collective responsibility is important.</p>
