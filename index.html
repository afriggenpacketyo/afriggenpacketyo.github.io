          <p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that the country will formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September. This decision aligns Australia with other Western nations like the UK and France, and is based on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including the exclusion of Hamas from government and the demilitarization of Gaza. Albanese framed the move as a crucial step toward a two-state solution and an end to the "humanitarian catastrophe" in the region, a decision criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as "shameful."</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Mali has issued repeated warnings for its citizens to halt gold mining operations and evacuate due to a deteriorating security situation. This advisory follows a series of violent attacks and kidnappings targeting Chinese nationals in the West African nation, which is one of the continent's top gold producers. The security landscape has worsened since a 2020 military coup, with a recent incident in May involving the kidnapping of two Chinese citizens and the destruction of their equipment, highlighting the significant risks faced by foreign investors in the region.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is set to peak this week, but visibility for viewers in North America will be significantly compromised. The peak on August 12-13 coincides with a waning gibbous moon that will be 84% full, which will outshine many of the fainter meteors. The American Meteor Society predicts that these conditions will reduce the number of visible meteors by at least 75%, from a potential of 50 per hour in dark skies to just 10-20 per hour, disappointing many amateur astronomers.</p>

The association, which includes major producers like JSW Steel and Jindal Steel, claims that China is selling alloy steel wire rods at excessively low prices, causing a surge in imports that harms local industry. These materials are critical for India's automotive, defense, and aerospace sectors, and the move reflects growing efforts to protect domestic manufacturing from foreign competition.

          <p>A deep analysis of the Lucy Letby case reveals significant questions and potential flaws in the medical evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense. The case of one infant, Baby O, highlights these issues, with competing theories about the cause of death ranging from an injected air embolism to liver injuries from resuscitation or even birth trauma. Experts from both sides disagree on key points, such as the interpretation of skin discoloration and the plausibility of accidental injury, creating a bewildering and unsettled narrative that is now before the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>

          <p>A Chinese state media outlet has called for a boycott of Nvidia's H20 AI chips, labeling them unsafe and not advanced enough for Chinese consumers. The commentary, from an outlet associated with state broadcaster CCTV, alleges the chips could contain "back doors" for U.S. government surveillance, despite Nvidia's strong denials of any such vulnerabilities. This public distrust campaign adds another layer of complexity to Nvidia's efforts to comply with U.S. export controls while still serving the lucrative Chinese market, creating significant strategic uncertainty for the American tech giant.

          <p>Al Jazeera has reported that five of its journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike near Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The broadcaster condemned the incident as a "targeted assassination" and a premeditated attack on press freedom. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed targeting one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim press freedom organizations say fits a pattern of unsubstantiated accusations by Israel. This event brings the number of journalists killed in the conflict to 186, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>

A recent study suggested a minimum of 500,000 soldiers are needed, placing South Korea in a difficult strategic position and fueling national debate over potential solutions, including the controversial idea of conscripting women.</p>

Because black holes are sculpted by gravity into mathematically perfect shapes defined only by their mass and spin, these vibrations are pure and predictable.

          <p>A five-hour fire at an AT&T communications facility in Gardena, California, caused significant service disruptions, including temporarily knocking out the 911 system in nearby Redondo Beach. The blaze, which started as a trash fire, spread to a building housing electronics, lead-acid batteries, and telecommunications power systems, leading to a partial roof collapse. Over 100 firefighters responded to the incident, and while no injuries were reported, nearly 2,000 AT&T home phone and internet customers in the area experienced service impacts, with the cause of the fire still under investigation.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's plan for a military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the "best way to end the war speedily" and defeat Hamas. Speaking to foreign media, Netanyahu asserted that the goal is to demilitarize the enclave and install a non-Israeli civilian administration, not to occupy Gaza. The plan, which involves moving Palestinian civilians to designated safe zones, has drawn international condemnation and sparked an emergency UN Security Council meeting over fears it will worsen the humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas have experienced their warmest start to the year on record, a trend driven by climate change that is causing dramatic shifts in marine life. The unusually high temperatures are contributing to the appearance of species not typically widespread in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. At the same time, the heat is pushing some native cold-adapted species like cod to their limits. Scientists warn that these changes are a clear indicator of an ecosystem in flux due to the planet's warming oceans.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in western Colorado are battling two large, lightning-caused wildfires that have burned over 120,000 acres of drought-stressed terrain. The larger blaze, the Lee Fire, has forced evacuations and threatened the town of Meeker, burning through extremely dry piñon-juniper forests. Crews are facing challenging conditions with persistent hot, dry, and windy weather, at times having to pull back for safety. While resources are arriving from other regions, containment is difficult, and poor air quality remains a major concern across western Colorado and parts of Southern California.</p>

Despite Ohtani hitting his 41st home run, the Dodgers' inability to capitalize on numerous opportunities and a bullpen collapse allowed Toronto to secure the win, shrinking the Dodgers' division lead over the surging San Diego Padres.</p>

With up to three times more graduates than vacancies in some areas, the plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the move as a potential relief for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded amid already strained trust budgets.</p>
