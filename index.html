          <p>Overnight Russian strikes across Ukraine have resulted in at least seven deaths and 41 injuries, targeting both civilian and energy infrastructure. The northeastern city of Kharkiv was particularly hard hit, with residential areas and civilian facilities impacted by drones, aerial bombs, and missiles. Other regions including Kherson and Donetsk also reported casualties and damage, as Russia launched over 200 projectiles, a significant portion of which were neutralized by Ukrainian air defenses. The strikes underscore the ongoing conflict's impact on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure, prompting calls for increased international pressure on Russia. Optimism regarding the situation remains low due to the continued violence.</p>

          <p>The German government plans to challenge a Berlin Administrative Court ruling that deemed its policy of turning away migrants at the border illegal by appealing to the European Court of Justice. This decision follows Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with US President Donald Trump, where trade talks were a key focus. Additionally, authorities are responding to a major fire that has put the roof of the former state operetta building in Dresden at risk of collapse. The government's move reflects ongoing tensions surrounding migration policies and their legal implications within the EU.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has ruled that Ralph Leroy Menzies, a convicted killer with dementia, is competent enough for his death sentence to be carried out. Menzies was convicted in 1988 for the 1986 killing of Maurine Hunsaker, and the judge determined that despite his cognitive decline, Menzies understands the nature of his crime and punishment. Menzies chose firing squad as his method of execution. His lawyers plan to appeal the ruling, arguing that his dementia prevents him from understanding why he is being put to death, while Hunsaker's family expresses relief that justice may finally be served.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are engaged in ongoing negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial trade agreement, though significant differences remain on tariff issues. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which it asserts are negatively impacting the Japanese economy. Both countries aim to finalize a deal by mid-June, coinciding with a planned meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. The negotiations involve discussions on trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security, with Japan presenting proposals to strengthen supply chains and expand imports of U.S. farm products.

          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England and Wales, forecasting heavy rainfall, frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds. Some areas could experience more rain in a single hour than they did throughout the entire month of May, potentially disrupting transport and causing power outages. While thunderstorms are difficult to predict precisely, the weather agency advises that driving conditions may be hazardous due to spray and standing water, and train services could face delays. Despite the unsettled weather, Sunday is expected to be brighter with fewer showers, though isolated thunderstorms remain a possibility.</p>

          <p>WorldPride 2025 is culminating in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade, marking the first time the city has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its inception in 2000. The event also commemorates the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., traditionally one of the largest Pride celebrations in the country. Despite the usual scale, organizers note a dampened enthusiasm due to the current political climate, including executive orders limiting trans rights and a decline in corporate sponsorships following restrictions on "illegal DEI" initiatives. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park during the event has sparked controversy.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan commitments to fiscal responsibility, the US national debt continues to climb, with concerns mounting over the impact of President Trump's policies. Republican senators are threatening to block his spending plans, and economists warn of a potential crisis within three years due to the growing deficit. The ratings agency Moody's recently downgraded the US credit rating, citing the failure of successive administrations to address the rising debt and interest costs. While Trump has called for efficiency, his tax cuts are expected to add trillions to the debt, raising questions about the long-term stability of US finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts recommend several exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, focusing on strengthening foot muscles and improving flexibility. These exercises include foot doming to target the "foot core," wall stretches to relieve pain from plantar fasciitis, and toe spreads to improve flexibility and motor control. Toe yoga, calf raises, and foot massages are also suggested to enhance balance, stability, and overall foot health. Regular foot exercises can reduce injury risk, prevent pain, and improve foot health, but consulting a healthcare provider is advised for those with preexisting foot conditions.</p>

          <p>Georgia's fetal 'personhood' law is being tested in the case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant woman, raising questions about whether life support must be maintained for the fetus. The law, which went into effect after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, grants fetuses the same rights as a person, leading to conflicting interpretations on whether removing Smith from life support would be equivalent to terminating a pregnancy. While some officials argue the law doesn't require maintaining life support in such cases, others disagree, highlighting the complex implications of fetal personhood laws on medical decisions.

More than 40 percent of respondents worry that consumers may start avoiding rice due to the elevated prices, which have doubled over the past year. The government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers in an attempt to curb prices, but forging a consensus on an appropriate price level remains difficult. The survey highlights concerns about high farming costs and potential overproduction leading to price drops.</p>

          <p>The UK government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25, with the money primarily used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers. The Home Office aims to end the use of asylum hotels and speed up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money. However, the scale of aid spending on asylum hotels has led to significant cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities worldwide, exacerbated by reductions to the overall ODA budget.</p>

          <p>Tottenham captain Son Heung-min has lauded Ange Postecoglou as a "legend" who "changed the trajectory of this club," despite the manager's recent dismissal. Postecoglou, who led Spurs to their first silverware in 17 years with a Europa League final victory, was sacked after a season where the team finished 17th in the Premier League. Son expressed gratitude for Postecoglou's belief in the team and his trust in him as captain, highlighting the manager's positive impact on his personal and professional growth. Other players, including Vicario and Micky van de Ven, also paid tribute to Postecoglou's leadership and achievements.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is increasingly concerned about the growing number of African military officers receiving training in China, with a top US military chief noting the PLA's efforts to replicate US training programs. General Michael Langley, head of AFRICOM, warned that China is attempting to emulate the US International Military Education and Training (IMET) program. This concern arises as the Trump administration shifts from providing military aid to promoting African self-reliance, while China becomes a major supplier of military equipment, particularly in the Sahel region, where junta-led leaders are distancing themselves from Western partners. The US is wary of China's increasing influence in Africa.</p>

The decision comes after an executive order signed by President Trump, citing national security grounds following a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally in Colorado.
