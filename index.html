          <p>An analysis of voting trends indicates that both Democrats and Republicans are making strategic errors with Latino voters by treating them as monolithic blocs. Democrats have historically focused on social justice issues, potentially overlooking key economic concerns that drove some Latinos toward the GOP. Now, Republicans risk alienating these same voters by assuming their support extends to the most extreme conservative social agendas. The shifting allegiances suggest that demographics are not destiny, and a more nuanced approach is required to engage this diverse and rapidly changing group.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's top education official announced that teachers applying from California and New York must pass an exam designed to screen for "radical leftist ideology." The assessment, administered by the conservative nonprofit PragerU, has been criticized by opponents as a "MAGA loyalty test" that could worsen the state's teacher shortage. Proponents argue it is necessary to safeguard classrooms, while critics, including teachers' unions and education experts, contend it is an unconstitutional and paranoid measure that politicizes education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in Europe's top soccer clubs, driven by a 750% surge in league revenues over the past three decades. Four of England's "Big Six" Premier League teams now have American investment, with club valuations reaching unprecedented highs, such as Manchester United's recent £5 billion valuation. This trend is fueled by high wealth aggregation in the U.S. and the relative affordability of European teams compared to major American sports franchises. The rise of multi-club ownership models, however, is attracting regulatory scrutiny from soccer governing bodies. (not investment advice)</p>

Meteorologists describe the storm as "unusually large" and predict it will grow in size as it moves north through the Atlantic. The storm has already caused power outages in Puerto Rico.</p>

          <p>Texas Tech's football program has suffered a significant setback as new running back Quinten Joyner will miss the entire 2025 season due to a torn ACL. The injury, which was non-contact, occurred during a team scrimmage, sidelining the player who was expected to be the team's primary ball carrier. Joyner, a highly-rated transfer from USC, had returned to his home state for a larger role. The No. 23 ranked Red Raiders must now rely on other running backs to step up ahead of their season opener.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent consumer research reveals a 6% decline in customer traffic at casual and fast-food restaurants over the summer compared to the previous year. This shift is attributed to persistently high grocery prices, which are influencing broader spending habits. While dining out less, shoppers are not necessarily trading down at the supermarket, with sales of branded grocery items growing faster than own-label alternatives. The data suggests consumers are opting for smaller, in-home treats, like brand-name coffee or snacks, as a more affordable substitute for restaurant meals. (not investment advice)</p>

This nature-based solution, part of a broader regional strategy, aims to make the densely populated area more resilient to extreme weather.</p>

          <p>A couple in Los Angeles successfully converted their conventional lawn into a thriving, low-water landscape populated with native plants, creating a habitat for local wildlife. Using a $5,100 rebate from the city's turf replacement program, they covered all material costs for the DIY project, which involved removing concrete, sheet mulching, and installing drip irrigation. They designed the garden to be an extension of their home, with distinct outdoor living spaces. The project serves as an example of sustainable landscaping that conserves water while enhancing biodiversity and neighborhood aesthetics in a drought-prone region.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues Trump Administration's Actions Against UCLA Are a Pretext to Undermine Higher Education</h2>

          <p>A columnist contends that the Trump administration's demand for $1 billion from UCLA over alleged antisemitism is a disingenuous plot aimed at damaging the university system. The author argues that while antisemitism on campus is a real and unacceptable problem, the administration is using it as a pretext to advance an illiberal, anti-education agenda. The piece suggests this move will not make the campus safer for Jewish students and could instead fuel antisemitic tropes. It calls for alliances to defend academic freedom and institutional autonomy from what is described as a politically motivated attack.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that while the Trump administration's push to hold universities financially accountable for antisemitism is necessary, it exposes a disparity in how anti-Black racism is treated. The author notes that Black students and staff have long faced pervasive harassment, threats, and discrimination on campuses, yet these incidents have not triggered similar billion-dollar federal penalties. Citing FBI data on hate crimes, the article suggests both antisemitism and anti-Black racism are serious problems. It questions why one form of bigotry is prompting an aggressive federal response while the other is seemingly neglected.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the Santa Monica Proper hotel, an upscale establishment where rooms can cost over $2,000 per night, for allegedly failing to pay its workers the legally mandated minimum wage. The complaint, filed on behalf of around 100 employees, claims the hotel has not complied with a city ordinance that sets a higher minimum wage for hotel staff, currently $21.01 per hour. The lawsuit alleges that since its last collective bargaining agreement expired, the hotel has underpaid staff, with some earning less per hour than the price of a menu item like hummus.</p>

With an undefeated record since that final, England are strong favorites, but Kildunne says the team has reframed the pressure of expectation as a product of their own success.

          <p>A massive, 113-year-old wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved intact to a new location 5 kilometers away. The entire 672-tonne structure was lifted onto giant trailers for a two-day journey to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of local iron ore mining. The relocation of the landmark church is the most symbolic part of a wider project to move the city's center to safer ground. The complex engineering feat, traveling at just 500 meters per hour, has drawn large crowds to witness the historic event.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is planning to repeal the 2009 "endangerment finding," the legal foundation that allows it to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. While framed as a deregulatory action, the move has caused concern among many large businesses and industry groups, including the American Petroleum Institute. These groups prefer a predictable national standard for emissions, which helps shield them from a patchwork of state laws and climate-related lawsuits. Legal experts warn that removing federal oversight could expose companies to more litigation and create "chaos" for long-term investment planning.</p>

          <p>An article examines the devastating impact of gun violence in predominantly Black communities, such as Bogalusa, Louisiana, where firearm death rates have surged. Firearms are the leading cause of death for American children, with young Black men being the most affected group. The report contrasts this public health crisis with the Trump administration's actions to roll back gun violence prevention measures, including weakening federal oversight of gun dealers and cutting funding for intervention programs. This reversal of Biden-era policies occurs despite research showing the effectiveness of such programs in reducing homicides in hard-hit areas.</p>
