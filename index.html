          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike due to disagreements over pay raises, causing a complete shutdown of rail service and impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. The union, representing about 460 engineers, claims they haven't received a pay raise in five years and that competing agencies offer better compensation. NJ Transit suggests commuters work from home and is implementing a contingency plan with additional bus service, but it can only accommodate a fraction of the daily train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate the impact, and commuters are advised to seek alternative transportation options. </p>

          <p>A federal judge is reviewing the Trump administration's assertion of privilege to withhold details regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's legal team accuses the administration of stonewalling court-ordered fact-finding in their efforts to secure his release. The administration claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, while his lawyers argue that he has never been charged with any crimes. The Justice Department has cited attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege, and executive privileges to protect information regarding Abrego Garcia's removal. </p>

          <p>The article discusses how GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, such as Wegovy and Ozempic, have revealed flaws in the American healthcare system. Many people who could benefit from these drugs are unable to access them due to high costs and insurance complexities. The author notes that insurance companies often impose stringent criteria for coverage, while patients face the risk of using compounded medications with uncertain quality and safety. The dysfunction in the system is attributed to high drug prices, a weakened FDA, and restrictive insurance practices, leading to public frustration and anger. </p>

While China retained top place in a global shipbuilding industry that had boomed in recent years, some of its shipbuilders had been buffeted by shocks emanating from the US this year.
