          <p>Despite Ukrainian President Zelensky's call for a face-to-face meeting with Vladimir Putin in Turkey, Putin will not be attending the peace talks. Russia's delegation will instead be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. Former U.S. President Donald Trump suggested he might attend if Putin does, stating he would consider it if it could end the war. A high-level U.S. delegation, including Marco Rubio, is expected to attend the talks, seeking to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, with Trump claiming Russia and Ukraine were "very close to a deal".</p>

Investigations are ongoing, with one fire suspected to have been started by unattended campers.

          <p>President Trump is revisiting a plan to tie drug price caps to those in foreign nations, an approach Senate Democrats and the Biden administration previously rejected. Trump's executive order directs HHS to develop regulations imposing price restrictions if drugmakers don't voluntarily lower U.S. prices. Democrats initially favored a similar measure but faced opposition from moderates concerned about its impact on pharmaceutical innovation. The Biden administration ultimately scrapped Trump's initial "most favored nation" model due to legal challenges.</p>

Wildlife officials found injuries on some birds that could have been caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot, but the exact cause of death remains undetermined. Concerns over the bird deaths come amid broader worries about avian health across the U.S.</p>

This action follows the Trump administration's CFPB dropping a similar suit against Capital One. Capital One disputes the claims and plans to vigorously defend itself in court.</p>
