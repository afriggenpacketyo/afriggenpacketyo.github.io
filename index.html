          <h2>UK Faces Flash Flood Risk as Amber Weather Warning Issued for Thunderstorms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:36:42 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for southeastern England, anticipating torrential rain and thunderstorms that could lead to dangerous flash floods. Over a month's worth of rain is expected to fall in just a few hours, with the dry ground from a recent heatwave increasing the risk of severe surface water flooding. The warning covers London and the south coast, highlighting the potential for power cuts, transport disruptions, and damage to homes and businesses. Yellow warnings are also in place for other parts of England and Scotland as the storm system moves north.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal, its parent company News Corp, and owner Rupert Murdoch, seeking at least $10 billion in damages. The suit stems from an article reporting that Trump sent a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump vehemently denies writing the letter, calling the report false and malicious. A spokesperson for the newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones, stated they have full confidence in their reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit, which also targets the reporters involved.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the closure of its Office of Research and Development (ORD), its primary scientific research arm. The move is expected to impact a significant portion of the office's more than 1,500 employees and is projected to save nearly $750 million. This decision is part of a broader reorganization and staff reduction at the agency under the Trump administration. Critics, including former EPA officials, warn that dismantling the ORD is dangerous and will weaken public health protections by shifting the costs of pollution onto communities.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The incident, which occurred at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, represents the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. Officials stated the deputies were part of the elite Arson Explosives Detail and may have been working to render safe a grenade recovered the previous day. The investigation is ongoing with federal agencies assisting, but authorities have confirmed there is no active threat to the public following the blast.</p>

          <p>China's top disciplinary authority is highlighting a failed tourism project in Guilin as a key example of grass-roots government mismanagement and wasteful spending. The "Yaohan Longevity City" project, initiated in 2018, was intended to be a major health tourism hub but was left largely abandoned due to a broken capital chain and poor decisions by local officials. Originally planned with a 1.65 billion yuan investment, only a fraction was spent, leaving multiple buildings derelict. The case is being used as a stern warning to other local governments across China to avoid similar unrealistic and wasteful initiatives.</p>

          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic railgun that could nearly double the power of the current naval version. The innovative 'X-railgun' design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would increase bore pressure and allow for heavier projectiles. This addresses a key limitation of the existing technology, where shells are too light for significant impact against large targets like ships. The research aims to overcome power constraints that have hampered the military application of China's pioneering railgun technology.</p>

          <p>A state audit has revealed that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from critical understaffing, impairing its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The report highlighted a 32% vacancy rate in the last fiscal year, leading to the agency closing cases without sufficient inspection or justification. Auditors found that even when inspections occurred, documentation was often poor, and fines were sometimes improperly reduced. Labor advocates argue that chronic understaffing has crippled the agency, leaving workers vulnerable, especially as climate-related risks like extreme heat increase.</p>

          <p>Many of Donald Trump's most vocal supporters, who had recently criticized his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, are now rallying in his defense. The shift followed a Wall Street Journal article about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which prompted the president to file a major lawsuit and demand the release of grand jury testimony. This has redirected the base's anger towards the media, a familiar target, and has been framed as a victory by influential MAGA figures. The move appears to have successfully unified his supporters and cooled internal backlash over the Epstein issue.</p>

          <p>The United States is introducing a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for many foreign visitors, including tourists, business travelers, and international students. This fee, part of the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs. The provision states that travelers may be reimbursed if they comply with the terms of their visa, such as not overstaying. However, details on implementation remain scarce, creating uncertainty for travelers and the travel industry, with some experts advising clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. According to his physician, the condition is benign, common in older adults, and involves vein valves not working effectively, causing blood to pool in the legs. CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and can cause aching or heaviness, which typically worsens throughout the day. Standard treatments include lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and wearing compression stockings, with minimally invasive procedures available for more serious cases.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge has ordered state officials to deactivate a death-row inmate's implanted heart-regulating device just before his scheduled execution. The ruling addresses concerns from Byron Black's attorneys that the device, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, could deliver painful electric shocks as the state administers a lethal injection. The judge's order requires a medical professional to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution proceeds. The state is expected to appeal the decision, which raises logistical and ethical questions about medical involvement in executions.</p>

          <p>At the direction of President Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts from the sex trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein.

Although often disliked, experts emphasize the crucial ecological role of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers. To coexist peacefully, they advise against swatting at wasps and suggest distracting them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>
