          <p>OpenAI is backing the construction of a massive AI data center in Norway, its first such project in Europe. The "Stargate" branded facility, a joint venture between British firm Nscale and Norwegian company Aker, aims to house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026. This move aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data to be processed on the continent. The data center will run entirely on renewable energy, addressing the growing demand for large-scale AI infrastructure in a fragmented European market.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Russian aerial attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least six deaths, including a six-year-old boy, and over 50 injuries. Ukrainian officials reported that the barrage of over 300 drones and missiles damaged numerous locations, including the complete destruction of an apartment block entrance. The attack occurred despite threats of increased sanctions from the US, prompting Ukrainian President Zelensky to state that "peace without strength is impossible." The strikes also damaged a children's hospital ward, a university, and other civilian infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A technical failure in the UK's air traffic control system, managed by NATS, caused significant travel disruption, leading to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounding thousands more. The radar-related issue was resolved within an hour by switching to a backup system, but the knock-on effects are expected to last for days during the peak summer travel season. This is the second major NATS failure in recent years, prompting calls from some airlines for the resignation of its chief executive. The UK's Transport Secretary is set to meet with NATS to investigate the cause and prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned comments made by Spain's transport minister, Oscar Puente, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers as "Israeli kids" in a now-deleted social media post. The teens were removed from a Vueling flight in Valencia, with the airline citing safety concerns, a claim disputed by the trip's organizer. French ministers called Puente's statement "unacceptable and discriminatory," highlighting that it seemed to justify the poor treatment they allegedly received. Paris also criticized the use of force by Spanish police against one of the group's counselors during the incident.</p>

          <p>A Guardian opinion piece likens the recent EU-US trade agreement to the UK's 1956 Suez crisis, arguing it represents a moment of humiliating subservience for the European Union. The author contends that the EU made all the concessions, accepting a 15% tariff on most of its exports to the U.S. while eliminating its own smaller tariffs on American goods. The deal also includes commitments for the EU to invest heavily in the U.S. and purchase American energy and military equipment. This article suggests this one-sided pact undermines the EU's goal of achieving geopolitical influence and strategic autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

China's state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is promoting the C919 as a more readily available and cheaper option for the growing Southeast Asian air travel market.

          <p>Australia's plan to ban social media for users under 16, pitched as a solution to a youth mental health crisis, is facing scrutiny from experts. While the move has popular support, some academics argue there is no proven causal link between social media use and poor mental health, suggesting the government is opting for a simple but potentially ineffective solution. Critics also point out that a ban could push young people to less-safe corners of the internet and that social media can offer positive community connections for marginalized youth. The technical challenges of enforcing such a ban through age assurance technology also remain a significant hurdle.</p>

          <p>Brown University has agreed to a deal with the Trump administration to restore suspended federal research funding and end several federal investigations. As part of the agreement, Brown will pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations and adopt several policy changes, including removing race from admissions considerations. The university stated the deal was necessary to end financial pressure and government intrusion while preserving its academic mission. This follows similar agreements with other Ivy League schools, which the administration has targeted over allegations of discrimination and antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have initiated their trade deadline activity with a minor three-team deal involving the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. The Dodgers acquired pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski from the Reds, along with reliever Paul Gervase and catcher Ben Rortvedt from the Rays. In exchange, they sent minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. While not a blockbuster move, the trade adds a promising left-handed pitching prospect to their farm system. The team is still expected to pursue more significant upgrades to their bullpen and outfield before the deadline passes.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals the significant challenge local authorities face in combating organized crime gangs selling illegal tobacco and vapes in UK towns. In Newport, South Wales, 19 shops on a single road have been shut down in nine months, yet the problem persists as criminals simply reopen or move to new locations. The trade, which deprives public services of millions in tax revenue, is linked to wider criminality, including forced labor and drug dealing, leaving local residents feeling unsafe. Limited enforcement powers and elusive business owners make it difficult for Trading Standards to permanently address the issue.</p>

          <p>Democrats in Texas are strongly criticizing a new congressional map proposed by state Republicans, calling it a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" gerrymander. The draft plan, which has been encouraged by President Trump, would redraw boundaries to make five currently Democratic-held districts more favorable to the GOP. Opponents argue the map intentionally fractures Black and Latino communities to dilute their voting power and is a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act. The move is seen as part of a national battle for control of the U.S. House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority.</p>

Internet search history presented as evidence included queries like "How to make murder look like a heart attack?"

Analysts also point to the impact of U.S. trade tensions, which may be shifting some production orders to other countries with lower tariffs. The slowdown was also seen in the non-manufacturing sector, raising concerns about China's economic growth in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Shi Mingde, China's former ambassador to Germany, argued that the deal runs counter to the EU's stated goal of achieving "strategic autonomy." Speaking at an event in Beijing, he criticized Europe's "de-risking" policy away from China, suggesting it is ironic for the EU to increase its economic and security reliance on the U.S. while claiming that dependence on China is a risk.
