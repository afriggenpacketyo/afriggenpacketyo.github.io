          <p>Scotland's A9, a major trunk road, has been the site of 48 fatal crashes over the last decade, including a tragic 2022 incident that killed three American tourists. The road's design, which frequently switches between single and dual carriageways, is identified as a key factor contributing to dangerous driving behaviors and collisions. A long-promised £3 billion project to dual the remaining single-carriageway sections, initially slated for completion by 2025, has now been pushed back a decade to 2035. This delay has sparked significant public and political frustration, with officials citing external factors like Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. Interim safety measures have been implemented, but calls for accelerated infrastructure improvements continue as families grapple with profound loss.</p>

Key indices like Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all recorded significant gains, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng futures also indicated a stronger opening. This market optimism is fueled by the anticipation of lower interest rates, which could stimulate economic activity globally. Investors are now closely monitoring upcoming economic data, including Singapore's consumer price index, and the highly anticipated earnings report from artificial intelligence leader Nvidia.

          <h2>Benny Blanco Faces Public Backlash for Showcasing $200 Blueberries</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Selena Gomez's fiancé, music producer Benny Blanco, ignited significant online outrage after posting a TikTok video showcasing a $200 box of unusually large blueberries. Blanco's enthusiastic display of the expensive fruit was met with a wave of criticism from viewers who deemed it tone-deaf amidst widespread financial difficulties. Many social media users highlighted that $200 represents a substantial portion of their weekly or bi-weekly grocery budgets, underscoring a stark contrast in economic realities. This incident quickly became a talking point, drawing attention to issues of wealth disparity and the perceived insensitivity of public figures flaunting extravagant purchases during challenging times for many. The public reaction underscored a clear disconnect between celebrity lifestyles and the everyday financial concerns of a large segment of the population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has officially summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner following his "unacceptable allegations" that the French government is failing to adequately address a surge in antisemitism. In an open letter published in the Wall Street Journal, Kushner, father-in-law to Ivanka Trump, criticized President Emmanuel Macron, echoing Israeli concerns about a rise in anti-Jewish hatred since the war in Gaza. The French foreign ministry strongly refuted these claims, emphasizing that diplomatic protocol, specifically the 1961 Vienna Convention, prohibits ambassadors from interfering in a host country's internal affairs. This diplomatic incident underscores growing friction between the two nations, particularly concerning their divergent approaches to the Israel-Gaza conflict and France's plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September. The move highlights the delicate balance of international relations amid sensitive geopolitical issues.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has postponed its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from Starbase, Texas, just hours before the scheduled launch, citing an issue with ground systems. This latest delay comes after a series of previous test failures, underscoring the complexities of developing the world's largest rocket. The mission aimed to rigorously test various upgrades, including the Super Heavy booster's landing burn with a deliberately disabled engine and the Starship's suborbital flight path. Key objectives for the Starship included deploying Starlink simulator satellites and attempting an in-space engine restart. The successful development of this mega-rocket is vital for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified Starship to land astronauts on the moon by 2027, as well as for Elon Musk's ambitious goals of Mars colonization.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has made new allegations that Smartmatic executives, previously indicted for bribery and money laundering, diverted funds from a $282 million 2018 Los Angeles County voting machine contract into slush funds. These funds were originally established to pay bribes to election officials in Venezuela and the Philippines between 2012 and 2016. While prosecutors have not stated that any LA County money was ultimately used for bribes, the transfer itself raises significant concerns. Separately, Fox News, which is being sued by Smartmatic for defamation, alleges that LA County Registrar-Recorder Dean Logan received undeclared gifts from the company, including business-class travel. These new revelations further complicate Smartmatic's controversial history and its ongoing contract with LA County, intensifying scrutiny over the company's past practices and the transparency of its operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly rebuffed Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation to visit Baltimore for a public safety walk, instructing him to "clean up this crime disaster" first. The President further escalated the dispute by threatening to reconsider federal funding allocated for the reconstruction of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, implicitly linking it to the city's crime situation. This contentious exchange occurred after Moore criticized Trump's deployment of National Guard personnel for municipal policing in Washington D.C. as "purely performative." Governor Moore countered Trump's assertions by highlighting a 20% statewide reduction in homicides since his inauguration and a significant decrease in gun violence in Baltimore. The incident underscores ongoing political tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic state leaders regarding crime and federal intervention.</p>

While approximately 2,000 National Guard personnel are currently in the city, primarily engaged in protecting landmarks and crowd control without law enforcement duties, this new directive allows them to use force as a last resort against imminent threats.

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency in response to its infant mortality rate reaching a more than decade-high of 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, almost double the national average. This critical health crisis is particularly severe for Black infants, who face more than twice the risk of dying before their first birthday, with racial disparities widening. The state's comprehensive plan to address this includes expanding prenatal services in underserved counties, establishing a regional obstetric care system, and enhancing home visiting and community health worker programs. Public health experts stress that systemic issues like poverty, limited healthcare access, and housing instability are fundamental drivers, suggesting that individual and clinical interventions alone are insufficient. The declaration seeks to foster a unified effort across various sectors, despite challenges posed by federal funding cuts to vital monitoring programs.</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande is scheduled for delisting from the Hong Kong stock market on Monday, signaling the definitive end of its dramatic trajectory. Once valued at over $50 billion and hailed as China's largest real estate firm, Evergrande collapsed under a staggering $300 billion debt, becoming a stark symbol of the nation's ongoing property crisis. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined for allegedly overstating revenue by $78 billion and faces a lifetime ban from China's capital market. This delisting represents a critical milestone, underscoring the severe impact of the property slump on China's economy, which has significantly depressed consumer spending, led to mass layoffs, and eroded household savings. Experts indicate that a robust recovery for the sector remains uncertain, with long-term implications for the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

He contends that these systems, which include innovations like the Roadrunner drone interceptor and the Dive XL autonomous submarine, offer technological superiority and significantly reduce the risk to human combatants. Luckey argues that "smart weapons" are ethically preferable to "dumb weapons" that cannot differentiate targets, believing they ultimately foster peace through credible deterrence. Despite strong opposition from figures like UN Secretary General António Guterres, who deems lethal autonomous weapons "morally repugnant," Anduril's technology is already deployed by the U.S. military and in Ukraine.

Although the person received treatment and appropriate prevention measures were implemented, this development is anticipated to cause significant ripples in the beef and cattle futures market, already strained by tight supplies. The incident underscores the ongoing challenges in controlling the spread of this pest, despite recent announcements from the USDA about building a new sterile fly facility in Texas and Mexico's efforts to establish its own production plant.</p>

          <h2>Democrat Accuses Trump of 'Manufactured Crisis' to Deploy National Guard in Chicago</h2>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify his plan to deploy federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, bypassing local leadership. This proposed intervention, which could potentially extend to other major Democratic-led cities, comes after Guard troops in Washington D.C. were recently authorized to carry weapons. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson vehemently condemned Trump's intentions as "the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century," a sentiment echoed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who labeled it an "abuse of power." Democrats argue that Trump is exploiting crime narratives for political gain, despite local statistics indicating a significant reduction in violent crime in cities like Chicago. This political confrontation highlights deep divisions over federal versus state authority and the appropriate use of military personnel in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been removed from his position as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a decision that reportedly caught agency employees off guard and elicited strong criticism from members of Congress. Although no official reason was provided for the ousting, it follows a DIA assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities that converged significantly from President Trump's public pronouncements. Senator Mark Warner, Vice Chair of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, suggested this dismissal highlights the administration's "dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test." This incident, coupled with the recent removals of other senior military officials, intensifies concerns regarding the politicization of intelligence and military leadership under the current administration, potentially undermining trust and operational integrity within national security institutions.</p>

          <p>A devastating fiery crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula claimed four lives when a BMW M4, reportedly driven recklessly, crossed the concrete median into southbound traffic. The BMW collided head-on with a white Nissan Sentra, causing both vehicles to erupt in flames. Tragically, three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—died, as did the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra. The 25-year-old male driver of the BMW survived with major injuries, having been pulled from the wreckage by good Samaritans. While alcohol has been ruled out as a factor, the California Highway Patrol is conducting a thorough investigation, and charges against the BMW driver are pending. This horrific incident underscores the critical importance of safe driving practices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to deploy National Guard troops to Baltimore, intensifying his controversial initiative to intervene in Democratic-led cities under the premise of tackling crime. This move comes after approximately 2,000 Guard members were already deployed to Washington D.C., with a recent order authorizing some of them to carry weapons. Maryland Governor Wes Moore sharply criticized Trump's comments as "tone deaf and ignorant," asserting that local crime statistics demonstrate significant reductions in violent offenses, contradicting the President's claims of an "epidemic." Trump's declaration of "total safety" in D.C. since the deployment is also challenged by available local data. This ongoing political confrontation highlights deep divisions over the appropriate scope of federal power and the role of military forces in domestic law enforcement.</p>

This development follows his rejection of a plea deal that would have seen him deported to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea on smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia's attorneys suspect the Uganda proposal is a punitive tactic to pressure a guilty plea and fear it could ultimately result in his illegal return to El Salvador. This case underscores significant concerns regarding US immigration enforcement practices and the potential for severe consequences for individuals navigating the complex legal system.</p>
