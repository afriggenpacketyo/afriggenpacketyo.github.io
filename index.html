          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth is returning for a second season of his National Geographic series, "Limitless," where he explores methods for living a longer and healthier life. This season delves deeper into his personal fears and introspective questions about aging, inspired by a genetic test in season one that revealed his predisposition for Alzheimer's disease. Hemsworth distinguishes his approach from extreme biohacking, emphasizing a balance between health-conscious living and enjoying life with family. The article highlights his journey of learning a musical instrument with Ed Sheeran and climbing an Alpine dam, reflecting his philosophy that the greatest lessons arise from challenging experiences.</p>

          <p>The Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to become a major medical tourism hub, following South Korea's decision to eliminate value-added tax refunds for foreign cosmetic surgery patients. Hainan's government has set a goal to attract over 1.5 million domestic medical tourists annually by 2027, a substantial increase from the current 400,000. The province also plans to introduce at least 40 new international drugs and medical devices each year to bolster its offerings. This strategic push is designed to capture a larger share of the medical tourism market and reverse the trend of Chinese citizens seeking such services abroad. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidance from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients discontinuing obesity medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive at least a year of follow-up support. This advice stems from evidence showing that many individuals regain a significant portion of their lost weight after stopping the treatments. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process requiring sustained behavioral changes, such as healthy eating and exercise, rather than a short-term fix. The plan aims to help patients maintain their weight loss by providing structured support, including self-monitoring tools and access to community resources.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have arrested three individuals for allegedly assisting Austin Robert Drummond, the primary suspect in the murder of four family members whose infant was found abandoned. Dearrah Sanders, Tanaka Brown, and Giovonte Thomas are all charged with accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. The victims were identified as the infant's parents, grandmother, and uncle. A manhunt for Drummond, who is considered armed and dangerous, is ongoing, with a combined reward of up to $30,000 offered for information leading to his capture. Officials believe the attack was targeted, as Drummond had a prior relationship with the family.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, an Arizona woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly three decades, have filed a lawsuit to block her imminent deportation. They argue that placing her in expedited removal proceedings violates federal law, which typically applies only to immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years. Co Tupul, a single mother of three U.S. citizens, was detained during a traffic stop and told she would be deported without an immigration court hearing. Her attorneys claim this represents a new, illegal policy by the Trump administration to bypass due process for long-term residents.</p>

          <p>Storm Floris has battered the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland, with winds exceeding 80mph, leading to significant travel disruptions and power outages for over 43,500 homes. The storm, the sixth of the season, prompted an amber weather warning for most of Scotland, with authorities cautioning of a "threat to life." Rail services, ferries, and flights were canceled, and major bridges were closed to high-sided vehicles. The severe weather also forced the cancellation of events at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. While the strongest winds are expected to subside, blustery conditions and travel delays are likely to continue into Tuesday.</p>

An analysis of three of the largest claimed savings, related to canceled COVID-19 testing contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services, found the actual savings to be around $165 million, less than 3% of the $6.4 billion claimed by DOGE. Experts note that DOGE reported the total potential value of the contracts as savings, a figure that was highly unlikely to be spent as the pandemic waned.

The article also points to the confirmation of Jeanine Pirro as a top prosecutor despite her history of promoting election falsehoods and a new investigation into special counsel Jack Smith.

The state's largest active blaze, the Gifford fire, has already scorched over 65,000 acres and is exhibiting erratic, plume-dominated behavior.

          <p>A third child, 10-year-old Ari Buchman, has died from injuries sustained in a tragic boating accident near Miami Beach last week. She was on a summer camp sailboat that collided with a barge in Biscayne Bay, an incident that had already claimed the lives of a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl. A fourth girl was injured but has since been released from the hospital. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the crash, which occurred when the sailboat carrying five children and one adult counselor was struck and dragged under the barge. The Miami sailing community has been left shattered by the devastating loss.</p>

In a memo to staff, the company announced it will consolidate some Wondery teams under its Audible division, and Wondery CEO Jen Sargent will be stepping down. The move aims to better align teams and adapt to the evolving podcast landscape, particularly the rise of video podcasts on platforms like YouTube. Amazon acquired Wondery, known for hit shows like "Dirty John," nearly five years ago to expand its original audio content offerings.</p>

          <p>The global competition for rare earth minerals, which are essential for technologies from electric vehicles to military hardware, has intensified, with developing nations emerging as a key battleground. China currently dominates the supply chain, controlling over 60% of mining and 85% of processing, creating a strategic vulnerability for the United States and its allies. Western nations are now scrambling to diversify their sources and reduce this dependency. However, analysts note that these efforts are largely diplomatic and lack the substantial investment and technical expertise needed to effectively challenge China's control, making resource-rich developing countries the center of this high-stakes contest.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed paperwork to roll back a Biden-era policy that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide abortions in cases of sexual assault, incest, or to protect the health of the pregnant veteran. The administration argues the current policy is "legally questionable" and inconsistent with federal funding restrictions. If finalized, the new rule would still permit care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, as well as abortions to save the person's life. Critics, including Planned Parenthood, argue the move robs veterans of essential healthcare and puts politics over people's lives, especially since over half of female veterans reside in states with abortion bans.</p>

Heraty has worked in Haiti since 1993, and her family described themselves as "absolutely devastated" by the deeply worrying situation.

With the new U.S. tariff looming, the opening of the Chinese market provides a critical alternative for Brazilian exporters. The timing is crucial, as the majority of Brazil's 2025 Arabica coffee crop, the variety most popular in the U.S., has already been harvested. (not investment advice)</p>

India, which became a major buyer of Russian crude after the invasion of Ukraine, called the threat "unjustified," noting that the U.S. had initially encouraged the purchases to stabilize global energy markets.
