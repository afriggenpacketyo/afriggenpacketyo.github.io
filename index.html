          <p>U2 is officially back in the studio after an eight-year break, spurred by drummer Larry Mullen Jr.'s recovery from neck surgery. The band, speaking at the Ivor Novello Awards where they received a fellowship, expressed excitement about their renewed chemistry and the opportunity to create something original. Bono emphasized their focus on the future sound, noting that the simplicity of bass, drums, guitar, and vocals feels like a fresh idea in 2025. The band has spent recent years reflecting on their past, but they are now eager to explore new sonic territories and push the boundaries of their music.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for high-paying customers of his $TRUMP memecoin, sparking ethical concerns and protests. The event, which attracted crypto investors from around the world, was criticized as a way for the Trump family to directly profit from his political position. Attendees openly discussed their intent to influence U.S. financial regulations, and Trump promised to change everything for crypto, which is a stark contrast to the previous administration. Critics have accused Trump of selling access to the presidency through his memecoin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass’ public safety initiatives to avoid city worker layoffs. The budget cuts funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than since 1995, and reduces the number of new hires for the Fire Department. Some council members opposed the cuts, citing concerns for public safety, while others defended the plan as necessary to create a more equitable Los Angeles. The city faces a significant budget shortfall due to rising legal payouts and weaker tax revenues.</p>

          <p>Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, two employees of the Israeli Embassy, were killed in a shooting in Washington, D.C. Lischinsky had recently bought an engagement ring and planned to propose to Milgrim during an upcoming trip to Jerusalem. Both were passionate about their work at the embassy. Milgrim worked on environmental issues and promoted cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, while Lischinsky specialized in Japanese studies and sought to build bridges between Israel and other countries. The shooting has heightened concerns about rising antisemitism.</p>

          <h2>Harvard International Students Face Uncertainty After Trump Administration Action</h2>

          <p>International students at Harvard University are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration revoked the university's permission to enroll them. Students are worried about their degrees, visas, and ability to stay in the United States for postgraduate jobs. The action is seen as a pressure tactic against Harvard, which has resisted demands to change its hiring and admissions practices. This situation could destroy the university as we know it, since international students make up more than a quarter of the total student body.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is using an obscure bureaucratic lever to stop Harvard from enrolling international students by revoking its access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The Department of Homeland Security has the power to manage and track the enrollment of international students, and schools need government certification to use the SEVIS database. This action is a significant escalation in the administration’s efforts to pressure Harvard. Harvard could go to court to challenge its SEVIS termination.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has detected cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in international travelers arriving at airports in several states.

Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 may be more transmissible.

The protections include limiting detention times and ensuring adequate food, water, and clean clothes.
