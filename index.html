          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reversed local "sanctuary" policies in Washington, D.C., mandating that the Metropolitan Police Department fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. This directive, issued under an emergency declaration by President Trump, allows D.C. police to assist ICE agents, share immigration information, and make arrests based on administrative immigration warrants. The move is part of a broader federal anti-crime crackdown in the capital, though D.C. city officials have immediately challenged the legality of Bondi's order, stating they are not bound by it.</p>

          <p>The final arguments in the national security trial of Hong Kong media mogul and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai have been postponed due to his deteriorating health. The 77-year-old founder of the now-closed Apple Daily newspaper reported heart palpitations, prompting judges to delay the hearing until he receives medical attention. Lai faces potential life imprisonment on charges of colluding with foreign forces, in a landmark case widely viewed as a test of press freedom and judicial independence in the city. International rights groups and foreign governments have expressed grave concerns over his prolonged detention and health.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed significant signs of slowing in July, as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output fell short of expectations. Retail sales grew by only 3.7%, missing the 4.6% forecast, while industrial output also rose less than anticipated, signaling persistent weakness in domestic demand. The slowdown is attributed to a challenging external environment, extreme weather events, and a deepening contraction in the property sector. These figures raise concerns about China's ability to meet its annual growth target of 5% without additional government stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after a seven-month closure during which 177 World War II-era practice bombs were discovered and removed. The first device was found by a worker installing new equipment, leading to a specialist ordnance disposal team being called in for a full survey. The bombs, which were not live but carried a charge, are believed to have been deliberately buried on the site of a former military ordnance depot after the war. The community has expressed relief that the hidden danger, which children had unknowingly played above for decades, has finally been cleared.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The military base was chosen for its security capabilities and its strategic location, bridging the geographic proximity between the two nations. The hastily arranged summit follows several unsuccessful rounds of peace talks and comes as Trump seeks to fulfill his campaign pledge to resolve the conflict quickly. While the White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," the agenda is expected to focus on a potential ceasefire and territorial disputes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the growing issue of loneliness among young men, citing research showing a sharp decline in close friendships and a rise in feelings of isolation since 1990. The author argues that societal pressures push men into a "man box" of misogynistic beliefs and an identity grounded in domination, which is fundamentally at odds with building genuine community. The piece calls on men to take responsibility for changing this narrative by actively cultivating deeper, more emotionally open friendships in offline spaces. It suggests that moving away from a mindset of domination toward one of care is crucial for their well-being.</p>

          <p>A major federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated following the discovery of an unknown white powder. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly after five separate letters containing the substance were found in the mailroom. At least two people were exposed, but authorities reported the situation was controlled almost immediately and that no ongoing threat remains to employees or the public. The FBI is investigating and the substance has been sent to Quantico for further analysis.</p>

The article captures the local atmosphere, contrasting the state's usual quiet with the sudden influx of international attention. Some residents, like Governor Mike Dunleavy, view the meeting as a necessary step toward peace, while others express outrage that Putin, whom they consider an international criminal, is being hosted on U.S. soil. Many are particularly worried that a deal concerning Ukraine could be made without President Zelenskyy present.</p>

A significant change is the new recommendation to forgo alcohol entirely, citing mounting evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister appoint members of his party to the House of Lords, arguing a "democratic disparity" exists in the upper chamber. In a letter, Farage pointed out that Reform UK currently has no peers, despite receiving over 4.1 million votes in the last general election and controlling ten local councils. He contrasted this with parties like the Liberal Democrats, who have 76 peers despite winning fewer votes. While Farage supports reforming the Lords, he insists that in the interim, his party's electoral success warrants representation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s law enforcement by appointing DEA chief Terry Cole as the city's "emergency police commissioner." This directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi effectively places the Metropolitan Police Department under federal command, requiring all orders to be approved by Cole. The move follows President Trump's emergency declaration aimed at cracking down on crime and illegal immigration in the capital. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the city's attorney general have strongly pushed back, calling the directive unlawful and setting the stage for a significant jurisdictional conflict.</p>

This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the junta, which seized power in 2020 and 2021.

The judges cited the man's early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and troubled upbringing as reasons for the reduction.

          <p>This article analyzes the series finale of "And Just Like That," arguing that it provides a more fitting conclusion for its protagonist, Carrie Bradshaw, than the original "Sex and the City." After exploring widowhood and failed romances, the finale leaves Carrie single, finding contentment in herself and her enduring friendships rather than in a romantic relationship. The author suggests this ending is truer to the original show's core message that female friendships can be the most powerful and fulfilling "soulmate" relationships. It posits that by ending with Carrie alone but not lonely, the sequel corrected the original's fairytale ending.</p>

          <p>A Van Nuys man who had been tormenting his neighborhood for two months by blaring a loud train horn from his property has been arrested. Gary Boyadzhyan, 50, had affixed the horn to a palm tree and would set it off at irregular intervals, rattling windows and disturbing the peace. After police visited him and he promised to stop, he sounded the horn again just hours later, leading to his arrest for disturbing the peace. In an interview before his arrest, Boyadzhyan described the disruptive behavior as a "cry for help" related to personal issues.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. This innovation allows the uncrewed aircraft to be launched from the decks of nearly any warship, such as destroyers or frigates, without needing a runway, effectively turning them into miniature aircraft carriers. The drone can seamlessly transition from a vertical launch into a fast, long-range cruise flight, even in rough sea conditions. According to the project team, this new design is significantly superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in operation.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have announced they will seek the death penalty for Teresa Youngblut, a 21-year-old woman accused of murdering a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Vermont. A grand jury indicted Youngblut on a murder charge for the fatal shooting of agent David Maland during a traffic stop in January. The incident, which also resulted in the death of Youngblut's companion, occurred after the pair were under surveillance for appearing armed and wearing tactical gear.

The state scored particularly poorly on affordability, ranking as the third-worst in the nation. The report also noted Oregon's high vulnerability to environmental risks like wildfires and drought as a contributing factor to its low ranking. In contrast, neighboring Washington fared better, while states like Utah and New Hampshire were named the best places to relocate.</p>

In Novi Sad, protesters attacked the headquarters of the ruling party, leading to clashes and arrests.

The violence has drawn concern from the European Union, as human rights groups note a troubling pattern of repression against peaceful demonstrators in the country.</p>
