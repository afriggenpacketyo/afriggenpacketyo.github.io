          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 17:37:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has eliminated the "de minimis" tax exemption, which previously allowed parcels valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free. This policy change means consumers ordering goods from overseas will now face tariffs, leading to higher prices and potentially longer delivery times. The White House justified the move as a way to close a loophole exploited for illicit goods like fentanyl and to protect American businesses. Experts note that the cost of common items like clothing, beauty products, and electronics could rise significantly, with one analysis showing a 51% price increase on a pair of Chinese-made slippers.</p>

This marks the sixth time in the game's history that the jackpot has reached the billion-dollar threshold. The winner will have the choice between a lump-sum cash payment of approximately $453.1 million or an annuity paid out over 30 years, both before taxes. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, and the last jackpot was won in May.</p>

          <p>Following her third-round defeat at the US Open to Elena Rybakina, British tennis player Emma Raducanu shared her belief that top-ranked opponents raise their game specifically to prove their dominance against her. This loss concludes her Grand Slam season, during which all four of her defeats came against elite players. Raducanu is focusing on closing the gap by working with her new coach, Francisco Roig, to develop a more potent serve and improve her play against power hitters. Despite the loss, she remains optimistic about her overall improvement in recent months.</p>

          <p>Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, is undertaking a 105-mile solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The five-day protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to Republican inaction in the legislature. Kenyatta argues that these cuts disproportionately harm students, seniors, and workers who rely on public transit. He frames his march as part of a "time honoured American tradition" of protest to highlight the issue and pressure lawmakers to secure necessary funding.</p>

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, just months after emerging from a previous restructuring. The airline has been unable to stabilize its finances amid high costs and weaker domestic travel demand, leading to a net loss of nearly $257 million since March. Unlike its previous bankruptcy which focused on debt, Spirit now plans to reduce its network and shrink its fleet to cut costs by hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The filing follows a failed takeover by JetBlue and ongoing struggles in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton's run at the US Open has ended after he was forced to retire from his third-round match against Adrian Mannarino due to a shoulder injury.

The judges found that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacked the authority to set aside a prior TPS extension, as the governing statute is designed to be insulated from electoral politics.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed misdemeanor charges against a man who burned an American flag outside the White House earlier this week. The man, a military veteran, stated he was protesting President Trump's new executive order that directs the Justice Department to investigate flag burning. The charges are not for the act of burning the flag itself—which is protected symbolic speech under a 1989 Supreme Court ruling—but for lighting a fire in a non-designated area and in a manner that threatened property. Trump's order seeks to prosecute flag burning under other "content-neutral laws."</p>

The piece argues this represents an "ominous turn in political lawfare," where the legal system is weaponized against political enemies. While the alleged offense of misstating a primary residence on a loan application is a felony, it is rarely prosecuted, and the author suggests many politicians could be technically guilty. The article warns that such selective prosecution erodes the rule of law and could lead to a dysfunctional cycle of political revenge.</p>

The complaint argues this was a "predictable result of deliberate design choices" in the GPT-4o model, which was rushed to market without adequate safety testing.

The materials contain a confusing mix of right-wing and left-wing extremist references, alongside a reverence for past mass killers from various backgrounds.

          <p>With over a third of the Senate's seats up for election in 2026, the political landscape for control of the chamber is beginning to take shape. Democrats will defend 13 seats while Republicans defend 24, but the map presents few clear opportunities for Democrats to gain the four seats needed for a majority. Key contests are anticipated in states like North Carolina, where an open seat has drawn high-profile candidates, and Georgia, where incumbent Jon Ossoff faces a tough reelection battle. Several Democratic retirements in states like New Hampshire and Michigan are also creating potential pickup opportunities for the GOP.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic School, over 100 people gathered for a candlelight vigil outside the hospital where several of the injured children are recovering. The gathering of teachers, students, nurses, and police officers was a moment of shared grief and hope for the community. Among the victims being prayed for is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who remains in critical condition. Her mother, a pediatric nurse at the same hospital, learned her daughter was a victim only upon arriving for her shift, highlighting the deeply personal impact of the tragedy.</p>

CEO Max Levchin cited strong consumer transaction frequency and growth in both merchant partnerships and customer numbers as key drivers. The positive results and upbeat guidance for the upcoming fiscal year helped alleviate concerns about increased competition and the loss of Walmart as a partner. (not investment advice)</p>

The company stated that AI product revenue has maintained triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts due to heavy investment in China's competitive e-commerce market, investors were encouraged by the significant growth and profitability in the high-potential cloud and AI sectors.

          <p>A judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can probe State Farm's claims handling practices as part of the insurer's official rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms and have filed hundreds of complaints over alleged payment delays and underpayments. The administrative law judge denied a motion by California's Department of Insurance to handle the claims inquiry in a separate proceeding. This ruling directly links the insurer's service quality to its request to raise homeowner rates by 11%.</p>

The request follows a report that she may have avoided paying a higher rate of stamp duty on a property by declaring it as her main home while her primary residence for council tax purposes was elsewhere. The Tories allege this could be "inappropriate tax avoidance" and a breach of the ministerial code, which requires ministers' tax affairs to be in good order.
