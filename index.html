          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling qualifying students to use taxpayer funds for private school tuition. The bill allocates $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Supporters claim this will give parents more freedom in their children's education, while Democrats argue it will siphon funds from already underfunded public schools and primarily benefit wealthier families. Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the bill as a historic step, while critics called it welfare for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>Cheaper goods from China are expected to become more expensive for U.S. consumers as a tariff exemption expires, impacting ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu. The de minimis loophole, which allowed packages worth $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, is ending due to concerns over fentanyl and trade practices. Retailers are already adding tariff surcharges to orders, and experts anticipate delays in shipments due to increased inspections. Some companies may benefit as goods made in the U.S. could face less competition, though consumers may seek cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he refused to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence defied pressure from President Trump by declining to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during a Congressional session targeted by rioters. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power. Since leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>Israel briefly shut down its main international airport after a Houthi missile landed in the vicinity, highlighting the group's ability to strike distant targets despite a sustained US military campaign. The failed interception raises questions about Israel's missile defense system. The Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack, stating it was carried out in response to Israel's actions in Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis, while Iran warned it would respond to any attack on it.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Teuchitlán, Mexico, José Murguía Santiago, was arrested as part of an investigation into a suspected drug cartel training camp where human bones and clothing were found. The investigation focuses on possible complicity of authorities with the Jalisco New Generation cartel. The cartel allegedly used the ranch to train new recruits, with some officials claiming it was an "extermination center" where recruits were held and killed for non-compliance. More than 127,000 people are registered as missing in Mexico, with Jalisco having the highest number of cases.</p>

          <p>President Trump's expansion of executive power in his second term draws from a radical tradition of right-wing thought, favoring monarchical and dictatorial rule, according to Damon Linker. Influenced by theorists like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and Adrian Vermeule, Trump's administration seeks to consolidate executive power while rolling back the administrative state. This approach, amplified by figures like Russell Vought, threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers and asserts a near-permanent state of emergency.</p>
