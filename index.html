          <p>A Texas nurse captured poignant footage of young girls from Camp Mystic singing worship songs on a bus while being evacuated from catastrophic floodwaters. The videos provide a humanizing glimpse into the tragedy, which claimed the lives of at least 27 campers and counselors from the Kerr County camp. The area was left devastated and isolated after the Guadalupe River swelled to historic levels, washing away roads and buildings. The nurse's videos contrast the children's resilient spirit with the immense scale of the disaster unfolding outside their bus windows.</p>

          <p>A report from Airports Council International World reveals that global passenger air travel reached a new record in 2024, with 9.4 billion people flying, surpassing pre-pandemic figures. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport retained its title as the world's busiest, processing over 108 million passengers, though this is still slightly below its 2019 peak. Meanwhile, Dubai International Airport leads in international passenger traffic and has seen significant growth. The data highlights major shifts in global airport rankings and forecasts continued growth despite ongoing industry challenges like geopolitical instability and manufacturing delays.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A flash flood emergency was declared in Lincoln County, New Mexico, after intense rainfall caused the Rio Ruidoso to rise 15 feet in about an hour, reportedly washing away a father and two children. Multiple rescue missions were underway for trapped residents, with fast-moving water seen carrying away homes and debris. The National Weather Service issued urgent warnings for residents to seek higher ground. The area's vulnerability to flooding has been exacerbated by soil instability caused by wildfires that scorched the region last year.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States scales back its international development efforts, exemplified by the restructuring of USAID, China is actively filling the void. The piece suggests that Hong Kong, as China's most cosmopolitan city, is uniquely positioned to become a central hub for providing global public goods and mediation services, especially for nations in the Global South. It contrasts what it calls the U.S. administration's myopic "America first" approach with China's proactive stance, signaling a potential long-term shift in the dynamics of international soft power and cooperation.</p>

He expressed that the dysfunctional environment prevented him and the team from experiencing the "full Steve Nash" as a coach, though he still recalled his first year there as some of the most enjoyable basketball of his career.</p>

          <p>A week after a massive explosion at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility in Yolo County, California, families of the victims are holding a vigil and demanding information from authorities. The blast on July 1 killed seven people, including two brothers on their first day at the job, and sparked a large grass fire. Officials have not yet released a cause for the explosion or confirmed the victims' identities pending DNA tests, while questions mount about why a hazardous fireworks operation was located on property zoned for agriculture, leaving the community in grief and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its offshore wind capacity, adding 4.4 gigawatts in the first half of the year, matching its total for all of 2024. A report by Global Energy Monitor projects China will install over half of the world's new offshore wind capacity this year, with another 22 GW currently under construction. This rapid development, supported by strong government subsidies and planning, is a key component of President Xi Jinping's strategy to advance the nation's "high-quality" marine economy, enhance energy security, and create jobs in coastal provinces.</p>

          <p>To combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in UK criminal courts, a review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended implementing judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposals aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by streamlining the justice process, reserving jury trials for the most serious crimes. While the Magistrates' Association supports the move to speed up justice, some legal professionals have expressed strong concern, arguing that removing the right to be tried by one's peers fundamentally weakens the justice system.</p>

          <p>The trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has sparked a conversation about why the hip-hop industry has not had a large-scale "MeToo" reckoning comparable to Hollywood. Insiders and activists point to a culture of silence where powerful figures are protected, often through non-disclosure agreements and the threat of blacklisting victims. In hip-hop specifically, this is compounded by what some call "black protectionism," a desire to defend a genre that provides a rare path to success for Black artists, which can inadvertently shield alleged abusers from accountability and public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by TV personality Gemma Collins for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss service called Yazen. It is against the law in the UK to advertise such medications directly to the public. Collins' post, in which she credited the service for her weight loss, was one of nine similar ads from various companies that were banned in a recent crackdown by the regulator. The ASA determined her post improperly encouraged consumers to request a prescription medication, even without naming a specific drug.</p>

          <p>This analytical article argues that the immediate finger-pointing following the deadly Texas floods oversimplifies a complex tragedy. While some blame the National Weather Service or political decisions, the disaster resulted from a confluence of factors, including the region's natural geography in "Flash Flood Alley," the difficulty of precisely forecasting such events, and a history of underinvestment in local flood-warning systems. The piece suggests that focusing on assigning blame distracts from addressing the systemic vulnerabilities and the need for nonpartisan support for weather services and disaster preparedness.</p>

The article notes that as the U.S. builds a tariff wall, global trade patterns are shifting, with countries like China increasing exports to other parts of the world, potentially mitigating the impact of U.S. policy.

Critics and plaintiffs in the case argue that the cuts, which could affect over 100,000 jobs and gut entire agencies, will prevent the government from performing its congressionally mandated duties and represent a significant expansion of executive power.</p>
