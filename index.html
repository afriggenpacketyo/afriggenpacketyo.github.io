          <p>Meta is rolling out its "Teen Accounts" with default safety protections to Facebook and Messenger, following their introduction on Instagram. The article notes strong initial adoption and parental approval but also highlights significant criticism from child-safety advocates and researchers who argue the measures are not robust enough to prevent harm. Meta is also partnering with schools and launching an online safety curriculum to further its efforts, though the debate over the efficacy of these protections continues, with the company strongly defending its tools against what it calls misleading reports.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of additional police officers have been deployed in Manchester to provide reassurance to the community after a deadly attack on a synagogue. Greater Manchester Police are working extended shifts and have canceled rest days, supported by officers from other forces, to manage security for the city and the upcoming Conservative Party Conference. The attack resulted in the deaths of two men, with three others hospitalized, and authorities have arrested six individuals on terrorism charges. The article mentions that the attacker, who was killed by police, had recently been bailed on suspicion of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The FBI is allegedly considering a "showy" arrest and perp walk for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted on charges of lying to Congress. According to sources, an FBI agent was suspended for refusing to participate in the plan, which was described as using "large, beefy" agents in full tactical gear. The move is seen as highly unusual for a white-collar defendant and an escalation in the political feud between Comey and President Trump, who has publicly pressured the attorney general on the matter. This plan is reportedly facing resistance from other supervisors within the agency.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a railway station in Shostka, Ukraine, has injured at least 30 people, an attack President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as "savage." This incident is part of a broader Russian campaign targeting Ukraine's rail and power infrastructure ahead of winter, with another recent strike damaging energy facilities near Chernihiv. In response, Ukraine claims to have successfully struck one of Russia's largest oil refineries near St. Petersburg, exacerbating fuel shortages within Russia. The conflict also claimed the life of a French photojournalist reporting on the front lines in a separate attack.</p>

          <p>China has revealed that one of its J-16 fighter jets successfully intercepted and expelled two unidentified foreign stealth fighter jets last year. The pilot, Li, described the encounter as a deliberate provocation by the foreign aircraft, which were heading toward Chinese territorial waters. During the incident, the Chinese pilot performed an advanced maneuver, flying inverted just meters above one of the foreign jets before locking onto both, prompting their departure. The type and nationality of the foreign aircraft were not disclosed, but the report indicates they have not reappeared since.</p>

          <p>Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona has been unable to be sworn into Congress by Speaker Mike Johnson, leaving her constituents without representation. Grijalva believes the delay is intentional, as her first act would be to provide the final signature on a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move opposed by the Speaker and Donald Trump. Johnson's office has stated that the House will not be in session to swear her in until the government shutdown ends, a situation Republicans blame on Senate Democrats, further frustrating Grijalva's efforts to begin her term.</p>

          <p>This commentary highlights a concerning trend where hundreds of women have been charged with "pregnancy-related crimes" since the overturning of Roe v Wade, according to new research. The article argues that prosecutors are using laws meant to protect children to criminalize pregnant individuals, often low-income women, for behaviors like substance use, thereby advancing the concept of "fetal personhood." The author draws a parallel to El Salvador's total abortion ban, which has led to the imprisonment of women for miscarriages, warning that the U.S. may be heading down a similar path of aggressive pregnancy policing.</p>

She regularly sends messages on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to document their lives and her unwavering love and support. The expert suggests this practice creates a valuable legacy and a collection of memories that can be shared with the children at a milestone age or provide comfort in case of tragedy.

The facility, which faced a downturn after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, is now a critical part of the U.S. strategy to build a domestic nuclear supply chain.

Goodall cited the cruelty of factory farming and the significant environmental damage caused by meat production as her primary motivations.

Schools once considered regional brands have risen to national prominence, while families are now more willing to choose less-prestigious institutions that offer significant merit aid.

          <p>This reflective article commemorates the life and work of primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91. It recalls her groundbreaking discovery in 1960 that chimpanzees make and use tools, a finding that forced a re-evaluation of the definitions of humanity and intelligence. The author emphasizes Goodall's ability to build trust and communicate with chimpanzees like "David Greybeard," which transformed our understanding of the natural world. Her work is celebrated not just for its scientific impact but for fostering a deeper sense of connection and empathy between humans and other species.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on those planning pro-Palestinian protests in London and Manchester to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews" following the recent deadly synagogue attack. He argued that the demonstrations would cause distress and stoke tensions at a sensitive time. Police leaders have expressed concerns that the protests will strain resources needed to protect Jewish communities, while protest organizers maintain that canceling peaceful demonstrations "lets terror win." The debate highlights the deep divisions and heightened community tensions in the UK following the violence.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter as an ideal time for a comprehensive financial review. With concrete income and spending data available, individuals can make impactful tax planning decisions before the December 31 deadline, especially with recent changes to deductions. It is also a crucial period to budget for the upcoming holiday season to avoid starting the new year with debt. Experts advise taking advantage of sales and finding non-monetary ways to show appreciation to prevent overspending amidst concerns about inflation and tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that the UK will leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if her party wins the next election. This major policy shift follows a party-led legal review which concluded that the ECHR obstructs key government objectives, particularly on migration and protecting military veterans. The move is seen as an attempt to appeal to right-wing voters and counter the growing influence of Reform UK, which has long advocated for leaving the treaty. The decision has been criticized by Labour as a sign of weakness and by legal experts who warn of serious political consequences.</p>

          <p>Academics in China are highlighting the growing role of speculative and science fiction as a tool for projecting the country's soft power and offering alternative future visions. At a recent conference, scholars noted that the genre has historically been dominated by Western, often dystopian, narratives rooted in capitalist ideologies. In contrast, they suggest that Chinese science fiction can present different possibilities and critiques of the present. This cultural push is seen as a way for China to stake a claim on how the future is imagined on a global stage, moving beyond Euro-American discourses.</p>

She testified that she was never able to brief the secretary, even as he made incorrect public statements about vaccines during a major measles outbreak.

          <p>The creation of "Tilly Norwood," a hyperrealistic AI-generated actress, has caused significant backlash from actors and unions in Hollywood. The avatar, developed by a UK-based AI production company, is being marketed as a "synthetic star" for films and ad campaigns, but SAG-AFTRA and other industry figures have condemned the move as a threat to human creativity. While major talent agencies have publicly stated they will not represent an AI client, the incident has amplified fears about the replacement of human performers.

With the U.S. increasing its naval presence in the Caribbean, relatives worry that the military pressure could either hasten their release or cause the authoritarian regime to hold them for longer.

Opinion polls show ANO leading with over 30% of the vote, well ahead of the incumbent center-right coalition. A victory for Babis, who opposes continued military aid to Ukraine and has promoted a "Czech first" agenda, could shift the country's foreign policy and align it more closely with Hungary and Slovakia in opposition to certain EU policies. If ANO fails to win an outright majority, it is likely to form a coalition with the far-right SPD party.</p>
