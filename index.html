          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, who anticipated a hold on major stimulus despite recent economic data showing signs of fatigue, balanced by a stock market rally. The article notes that the central bank had previously cut rates in May and maintained its seven-day reverse repo rate last week, following a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut. Policymakers are expected to implement marginal monetary easing later this year to meet the annual growth target.</p>
