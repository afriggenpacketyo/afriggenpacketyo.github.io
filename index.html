            <p>The British government has intervened to secure a supply of raw materials for British Steel, preventing the shutdown of its blast furnaces. A shipment of coking coal and iron ore from the US is expected to arrive at the Scunthorpe site, ensuring continued operation for the coming weeks. The government seized control of the business after talks with its Chinese owner, Jingye, broke down amid concerns about the plant's future. The government is seeking a private sector partner while not ruling out nationalization and Beijing has criticized the move, but the intervention has been welcomed by union officials.</p>

            <p>President Trump has sparked controversy by blaming Ukrainian President Zelensky for starting the war with Russia, a day after a deadly Russian attack in Sumy. Trump asserted that Zelensky shares blame with Putin and Biden for the conflict and the resulting casualties, criticizing the Ukrainian leader's pursuit of missiles and failure to secure victory. These comments follow previous clashes between Trump and Zelensky, including accusations of gambling with World War Three. Trump's remarks have drawn criticism given the context of ongoing Russian aggression and the devastating consequences for Ukraine.</p>

While experts expect the independent advisors to maintain their rigor, concerns remain about the potential impact of political influence on CDC staff and processes, especially given recent staff cuts.

            <p>A Fox News contributor proposes a one-time "conversion window" in the tax code to incentivize the conversion of traditional 401(k), 403(b), and IRA accounts into Roth IRA accounts. This would generate significant revenue for the government in 2026, potentially trillions of dollars, which could be used to fund tax cuts. The author suggests a conversion tax rate between 10% and 25% to encourage participation. The biggest obstacle to this idea is the lack of a lobby pushing for it. (not investment advice)</p>

The director initially regretted including the cameo but changed his mind after audiences reacted positively. The article references previous instances of Trump's cameo being removed and Trump's response, as well as the administration's actions against media figures and deportation cases.</p>

            <p>China's semiconductor traders in Huaqiangbei are facing significant challenges due to the ongoing tariff war between the US and China. Orders have plunged since last week as the price of CPUs from Intel and AMD has increased by 10 to 40 percent. These traders, who primarily source chips from the US for domestic buyers, are among the first to feel the pinch from the tariff hikes. With Trump having imposed a 125 percent duty on Chinese imports since April, on top of 20 percent imposed earlier this year, bringing the effective cumulative rate to about 156 percent, business has been severely impacted.</p>

            <p>NPR's reporting on a whistleblower report reveals concerns about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessing sensitive data at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). DOGE appeared to ignore standard security practices, and the NLRB's data is extremely sensitive and unrelated to DOGE's cost-cutting mission. Elon Musk's businesses are the subject of NLRB investigations, and DOGE has a pattern of seeking sensitive data without adequately protecting it. Labor experts fear the release of this data could harm organized labor, potentially chilling worker rights and exposing sensitive corporate information.</p>

The inquiries, authorized under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, will assess the impact of these imports on U.S. national security. While pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are currently exempt from broader tariffs, Trump has indicated they will face separate levies. The move has prompted concern from drugmakers about potential shortages and reduced patient access, while Taiwan's economy minister has vowed to ensure fair competition for the Taiwanese chip industry.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing over $2 billion in federal funding for Harvard University after the institution rejected a list of demands aimed at combating antisemitism on campus. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. The White House claimed that Harvard had failed to meet the intellectual and civil rights conditions necessary for federal investment. The demands included reporting students hostile to American values and hiring an external auditor to oversee programs that allegedly fuel antisemitic harassment.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off as investors fled the safe haven amid market turmoil caused by President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. The 10-year Treasury yield soared to its highest level since February, raising questions about who was selling and why. China, Japan, and hedge funds are all speculated to be potential sellers, with various motivations such as weaponizing Treasury holdings, reducing exposure to U.S. policy uncertainty, and purchasing European fixed income. The unusual outflow highlights the market's reaction to trade policy volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A concert brawl over a singer's refusal to perform narcocorridos has reignited the debate in Mexico over whether to ban the genre to reduce violence. President Claudia Sheinbaum opposes bans, favoring social awareness campaigns against glorifying drug trafficking. However, voices within her own party support bans, despite criticism from lawyers and doubts about their effectiveness. Several states have already implemented bans on narcocorridos, leading to debates over freedom of expression and the root causes of violence.</p>
