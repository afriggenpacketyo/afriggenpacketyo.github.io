          <h2>NIH Implements Additional Staff Layoffs, Including at Cancer Research Institute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 16:25:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted a second round of layoffs, impacting approximately 200 employees, including around 50 from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This move surprised NIH officials, as previous claims indicated no further cuts were planned. The layoffs are reportedly aimed at redirecting resources towards critical programs and maximizing taxpayer dollar impact, with the savings intended to offset the reinstatement of other scientists. The NCI's Office of Communications and Public Liaison, which oversees programs like the Cancer Information Service, was among those affected by the cuts, leading to concerns about the agency's ability to handle press inquiries.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, despite exceeding Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The company anticipates offsetting $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions, but cites potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and further tariff increases as reasons for the suspension. Ford's CFO, Sherry House, stated that the company's turnaround plan is working and that Ford is transforming into a higher growth, higher margin business. The tariff impact stems from 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts not compliant with the USMCA agreement, leading Ford to cease U.S. exports to China and adjust imports from China.</p>

          <p>A short power outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for 60 to 90 seconds, disrupting communication with aircraft. The FAA halted departures to Newark due to telecommunications and equipment issues at the Philadelphia TRACON, which directs aircraft in and out of the airport. United Airlines has unilaterally cancelled 35 roundtrip flights per day from its Newark schedule to alleviate congestion caused by the shortage of air traffic controllers, runway construction, and bad weather. The FAA acknowledged the stress on controllers due to frequent outages and is working to improve telecommunications equipment and automation systems.</p>

          <p>Chrissie Tully, now 93, gave birth to a son in 1949 in an Irish home for single mothers and has been waiting for him ever since, haunted by the secrecy and shame surrounding these institutions. She was told her baby died, but the lack of closure and the possibility he was given up for adoption have fueled her hope. She later had another son, Christopher, who was also taken from her, but they reunited in 2013, and he has helped her search for her firstborn, Michael. The article delves into the grim history of St. Mary's Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, Ireland, where many children were secretly adopted or died and were buried in unmarked graves.</p>

          <p>Palantir has increased its revenue guidance following a significant surge in both commercial and government revenue, driven by increased adoption of its artificial intelligence software. CEO Alex Karp attributes the growth to a "tectonic shift" in AI adoption, noting a 71% increase in commercial revenues and a 45% jump in government segment sales. Palantir forecasts U.S. commercial revenues to exceed $1.178 billion this year, fueled by greater U.S. defense sector adoption of its tools. Karp also highlighted the growing demand for large language models and supporting software, describing it as a "stampede."</p>

One amendment also seeks to prevent retribution against news organizations that continue to use the former name. A White House spokeswoman asserted that Democrats are putting America last due to "Trump Derangement Syndrome," while a Democratic representative countered that the renaming is a "vanity project" that accomplishes nothing.</p>

The government's use of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to terminate records based on crime-related information has been criticized for lacking due process.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett announced his intention to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel slated to succeed him in January 2026, the board having voted unanimously on the decision. The announcement marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which Buffett transformed from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate. Despite the decline, Macrae Sykes of Gabelli Funds expressed confidence that Buffett's continued role as chairman will provide mentorship and intellectual capacity for future capital allocation decisions.

The investigation also found that six of eight regents contributed more than $33,000 combined to Nesselâ€™s campaigns, and her office hired a regentâ€™s law firm to handle major state cases.</p>

This statement was made in the context of his push for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
