          <p>Hunan province is implementing new regulations to tighten control over non-tax revenue sources, such as fines and confiscated goods. The move, effective November 1, aims to reduce financial burdens on private businesses struggling with a post-pandemic slowdown. This policy explicitly forbids local officials from using fines to boost revenue or linking law enforcement performance to fine collection, reflecting Beijing's broader effort to improve market sentiment and investor confidence amid economic challenges.</p>

Hammack expressed particular concern about persistent inflation, especially in the services sector, noting the Fed has missed its 2% target for over four years. Her comments follow a recent interest rate cut but also come amid strong economic data that has tempered expectations for further aggressive monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>

The Sanxingdui ruins, dating back about 4,500 years, are one of China's most significant archaeological finds and represent the ancient Shu kingdom.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's all-time leading goalscorer, Wayne Rooney, has harshly criticized the current state of his former club, stating it is "broken" and that its "soul has gone." In a podcast, Rooney said he has "no faith" in manager Ruben Amorim to improve the team's poor performance, which has left them 14th in the Premier League table. He also condemned the club's culture, recent staff redundancies, and a perceived lack of fight from some players, who he said "don't deserve to wear the shirt."</p>

          <p>An Oxfordshire widow, Mimi Conder, has started a petition calling for mandatory police support for families bereaved by suicide, a policy she calls "Jason's Law" in memory of her late husband. She describes being left alone to navigate the confusing and intimidating processes of police questioning and the coroner's inquest without any guidance. The petition asks for trained Family Liaison Officers (FLOs) to be assigned in such cases to explain procedures, a service Thames Valley Police currently does not provide for non-suspicious deaths.</p>

The National Weather Service reported that Phoenix experienced its fourth wettest day on record, with the extreme rainfall overwhelming the area.</p>

          <p>Two veterinarians are renewing their appeal for population management of the rare Soay sheep on the remote Scottish archipelago of St Kilda, arguing that hundreds starve to death each winter. They contend that the sheep, descended from domesticated animals, should not be treated as wild and that their numbers on the main island of Hirta are unsustainably high. However, the National Trust for Scotland and the Scottish government maintain that the sheep are wild animals and do not fall under the same welfare laws as farm animals.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques Kamala Harris's new memoir, "107 Days," arguing it reveals a politician overly focused on the spectacle of politics rather than substantive policy. The author suggests the book portrays a campaign that relied on celebrity endorsements and self-valorization, failing to connect with voters outside its bubble. The memoir is presented as evidence that Harris's campaign struggled not from a lack of time, but from an inability to present a unique, compelling vision distinct from the unpopular Biden administration.</p>

          <p>According to a forecast from Goldman Sachs, China's central bank is likely to ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter to support slowing economic growth. The analysis suggests a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This prediction follows a central bank meeting that maintained a dovish stance and a subtle shift in official language, describing the economy as "making strides while maintaining stability" rather than "showing positive momentum."
