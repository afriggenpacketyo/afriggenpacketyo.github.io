          <p>A massive $130 million donation intended to pay U.S. military salaries during the government shutdown was reportedly made by Timothy Mellon, an heir to the prominent Mellon banking family. President Trump announced the gift from an unnamed "patriot," but the amount only covers about $100 per service member, making its impact largely symbolic. The donation also raises legal questions, as it may violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from using funds not appropriated by Congress, making its practical application highly uncertain.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for producing smartphones, electric vehicles, and military technology. The move is a response to recent export curbs imposed by Beijing, which the EU claims are causing significant economic damage and forcing some European companies to halt production. The EU's strategy includes increasing recycling efforts, developing domestic production, and forming partnerships with other resource-rich countries to secure a stable supply chain.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a participant in the January 6th Capitol riot who was later pardoned by President Trump, has been arrested and charged with making a terroristic threat. Moynihan allegedly sent text messages detailing a plan to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City. This incident is part of a rising trend of threats against lawmakers and highlights concerns about recidivism among the more than 1,500 pardoned riot defendants, some of whom have been arrested for other crimes since their release.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery, inspiring global river restoration movements. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water quality has improved, and native wildlife is returning to the area. The restoration was celebrated by a 30-day, 310-mile kayak journey by Indigenous youth, who became the first to navigate the entire river in more than 100 years, highlighting the cultural and environmental significance of the river's renewal.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, a measure to redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats, is being marketed to voters as a way to counteract Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas. Proponents, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are framing the initiative as a necessary response to actions encouraged by Donald Trump, leveraging the former president's unpopularity in the state. This strategy aims to create five additional safe Democratic seats in the House, with campaign messaging focusing on fighting fire with fire rather than the technical aspects of redistricting.</p>

          <p>A new study found that nearly 20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) among a group of patients were caused by E. coli strains genetically linked to contaminated meat from local grocery stores. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the infections, identifying turkey and chicken as the most common sources of the bacteria, followed by pork and beef. The findings suggest that contaminated meat is not just a food poisoning risk but also a significant contributor to common and sometimes severe infections, with a higher prevalence observed in lower-income areas.</p>

          <p>In a new interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris has strongly indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028, stating that her career in public service is "not done." Despite current polls placing her as an underdog for the Democratic nomination, Harris dismissed their relevance, noting she has defied polls throughout her political career. She also used the interview to criticize former President Trump as a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system, asserting that her previous warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been validated.</p>

While not a landslide, the result places Powell in a senior, directly elected role, where she is expected to articulate her critiques of the party's strategy primarily in private.</p>

Instead of simply prohibiting an action, parents should explain the reasoning behind the limit, especially regarding safety and kindness.
