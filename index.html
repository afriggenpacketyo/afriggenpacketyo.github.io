Mulaney's approach embraces weird and sometimes confusing antics, aiming for pure, anarchic comedy rather than directly addressing current events.

          <p>Prices of new and used vehicles in the U.S. are projected to increase due to President Trump's auto tariffs, according to a new analysis from Cox Automotive. The firm anticipates that the levies will add thousands of dollars to the costs of new cars and trucks, both imported and domestic, and will also drive up used car prices. Automakers have responded in various ways, and the market is described as a "roller coaster ride" due to economic uncertainty and regulatory changes. Cox Automotive expects wholesale prices of used vehicles to increase between 2.1% and 2.8% by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
