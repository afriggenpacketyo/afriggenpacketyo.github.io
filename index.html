Although the delay provides a six-week window for negotiations, Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding suggests it may not be enough time to resolve all issues. Experts caution that uncertainty persists, with the EU unlikely to capitulate to Trump's negotiation tactics, and sectors like tech and industrials particularly vulnerable to market whiplash.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived in Ottawa for a two-day visit to Canada, widely interpreted as a message of support amidst threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, welcomed the royal couple, and the King is scheduled to deliver a "Speech from the Throne" to Canada's Parliament. The visit is seen as a sign of solidarity with Canada, rejecting Trump's suggestion that the country should become the 51st U.S. state.</p>
