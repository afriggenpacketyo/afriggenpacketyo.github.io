          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that its online services will face disruptions until July due to a sophisticated cyberattack that occurred over the Easter weekend, impacting click-and-collect and contactless payments. The ransomware attack, believed to be the work of Scattered Spider using DragonForce tools, is expected to reduce the company's profits by approximately £300 million this year. Despite the setback, M&S CEO Stuart Machin views the incident as an opportunity to accelerate the company's turnaround strategy, which involves updating in-store ranges, property portfolio, and back-office systems. The company anticipates insurance to cover about a third of the financial impact, while they work to mitigate additional waste and logistic costs, including potential fines for data loss and litigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' aimed at advancing his domestic agenda, but faced resistance from various factions within the party. Negotiations with key holdouts continued, focusing on issues such as Medicaid reforms and state and local tax deductions (SALT), with Speaker Mike Johnson working to bridge the divides. The bill includes provisions to extend the 2017 tax cuts, eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, increase military and immigration enforcement spending, and reduce funding for Medicaid, food stamps, education, and clean energy subsidies. Despite some progress in negotiations, significant differences remain, particularly regarding Medicaid and SALT deductions, threatening the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo has revealed a debate within the Labour party regarding tax policies, with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner suggesting tax increases to Chancellor Reeves, who ultimately did not implement them. The memo proposed measures such as increasing the corporation tax rate on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, scrapping the tax-free allowance on dividends, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the cabinet's unity, Conservatives criticized the proposals, urging the chancellor to rule out tax increases in the Autumn Budget.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede has allowed venomous snakes to bite him over 200 times, developing immunity to multiple types of venom, which has intrigued researchers about the possibility of creating a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Existing antivenoms are typically derived from animals injected with specific venoms to produce neutralizing antibodies. Researchers studying Friede's blood hope to synthesize a treatment effective against various venomous snake bites, potentially saving countless lives.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, has sparked concern among some Maga Catholics due to his perceived progressive stances, which contrast with their traditionalist views. Figures like Steve Bannon and JD Vance have previously invoked religious arguments to support policies such as cutting international aid and imposing strict immigration measures. Pope Leo XIV's focus on addressing global issues like climate change, inequality, and migration challenges the nationalistic and insular worldview of the Maga movement. His choice of name, referencing Leo XIII, signals a commitment to addressing modern social and economic injustices, potentially setting the stage for a clash between the Vatican and Trumpian nationalism.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega-tsunami” could potentially devastate parts of America's West Coast if a strong earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially causing coastal land to sink and triggering massive waves. Cities like Seattle and Portland, Oregon, are at risk, and the lack of time for adaptation or mitigation makes this a significant threat. The most severe effects are expected in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California, while Alaska and Hawaii are also vulnerable.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Chief Calls US Export Curbs on AI Chips to China a Failure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 01:45:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China have been ineffective, as companies are turning to locally developed technology. Huang noted that these curbs have spurred Chinese companies to invest in and develop their own supply chains, reducing Nvidia's market share in China. The U.S. had imposed these controls to prevent sophisticated chips from being used to advance China's military systems and to maintain American dominance in AI, but Huang believes the restrictions have backfired.</p>

          <p>During a Senate hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly described habeas corpus as the president’s “constitutional right” to deport people, contradicting the legal principle that protects against unlawful detention. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, emphasizing that habeas corpus ensures individuals are not detained without valid legal grounds. The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus for detained migrants, a move legal experts say can only be done by Congress. Noem's remarks highlighted the administration's expansive view of presidential power and a misunderstanding of fundamental constitutional rights.</p>

The company's "retention scheme," which could have amounted to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, was intended to reward executives for securing a £3 billion rescue loan. However, Downing Street deemed it unacceptable for bosses at the troubled firm to reward themselves for failure. Thames Water will await guidance from Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations.</p>

The comment was seen as insensitive given the rising rice prices and economic struggles faced by many Japanese citizens. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as his replacement. The incident has further strained Ishiba's already struggling government ahead of a crucial national election in July, underscoring the importance of addressing public concerns about food security and affordability.</p>

Health experts warn that these pouches can have harmful side effects and contain significantly higher levels of nicotine than cigarettes. Concerns are rising that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes could lead more young people to turn to nicotine pouches.</p>

          <p>New satellite analysis reveals that tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with wildfires being the primary cause, surpassing land clearances for agriculture. The loss of old-growth tropical forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, equivalent to the emissions of the European Union. While South East Asia saw progress in reducing forest loss through government policies, the Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, leading to widespread fires. Researchers emphasize the need for sustained protection policies and financial incentives to conserve these vital ecosystems.</p>
