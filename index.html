          <p>European stock markets opened with uncertainty, heavily influenced by the ongoing political crisis in France, which saw the CAC 40 index close lower. The resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu particularly rattled investors, causing French bank stocks like Societe Generale and BNP Paribas to decline significantly. This instability was compounded by disappointing German factory order data, which fell short of expectations. Meanwhile, U.S. markets showed signs of strain related to the ongoing government shutdown, though Asian markets, particularly Japan's Nikkei, reached record highs.</p>

          <p>France's political landscape has been thrown into turmoil following the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu after only 27 days in office. Lecornu stated he was unable to form a functional government due to the refusal of rival parties to compromise on budget and policy matters. President Emmanuel Macron now faces difficult choices, including appointing a sixth prime minister in under two years or dissolving parliament for new elections, a risky move given the current lead of Marine Le Pen's National Rally party in the polls.</p>

          <p>Negotiations in Egypt for a Gaza peace deal, based on a framework proposed by Donald Trump, face several major sticking points between Israel and Hamas.

          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, a notable increase from its 4% prediction in April, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target. This revision is attributed to strong government stimulus measures and resilient export performance, which have helped offset a domestic real estate slump. However, the bank warns that growth is expected to slow to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus fades and challenges like tepid consumer spending persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has weighed in on a diplomatic dispute by stating that United Nations Resolution 2758, passed in 1971, does not mention Taiwan. The EU spokesperson clarified that the resolution solely addressed the issue of switching China's representation in the UN from Taipei to Beijing. This position supports the view held by the United States and Taiwan, directly challenging China's long-standing claim that the resolution provides an international legal basis for its sovereignty over the island.</p>

          <p>Herut Nimrodi, the mother of Israeli hostage Tamir Nimrodi, shared her family's two-year ordeal of not knowing if her son is dead or alive since his capture on October 7, 2023. She expressed a sense of "real hope" in the peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly because its first phase includes the release of all hostages, both living and deceased. Nimrodi described her family's life as one long, exhausting day since seeing a video of her son's abduction.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown continues as the Senate once again failed to advance legislation to fund federal agencies. In a series of votes, both a Republican-backed measure and a rival Democratic proposal fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage. The political stalemate persists, with Democrats insisting on extending health care subsidies and Republicans blaming them for holding up government funding, leading to disruptions in federal services and uncertainty for workers and aid programs across the country.</p>

In a letter to the judge, his legal team argued that the prison's residential drug treatment program would be crucial for Combs' rehabilitation and that its location would help maximize family visitation. The final decision on placement rests with the federal Bureau of Prisons, not the judge.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law that requires streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube to ensure that the volume of their commercials is not significantly louder than the programs they accompany. This legislation extends a federal rule that has applied to broadcast and cable television since 2010, aiming to create a more consistent and less jarring viewing experience. Since many major streaming platforms are based in California, this state-level bill could effectively set a new national standard for ad volume.</p>

The end of the preferential trade terms is expected to make African goods less competitive and may encourage these countries to strengthen their economic ties with China as an alternative.</p>

Pritzker claimed that agents used Black Hawk helicopters to raid an apartment building, employing "thuggery" to create fear and a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act. The Department of Homeland Security refuted the governor's claims as a "smorgasbord of lies," arguing that their actions are a necessary response to violent crime and attacks on federal officers.</p>

The team's veteran experience was on full display, from a patient four-run rally in the seventh inning to a crucial, high-pressure defensive "wheel play" in the ninth that prevented the Phillies from tying the game. Blake Snell delivered six scoreless innings, and despite a shaky ninth from the bullpen, the Dodgers' composure and execution proved decisive in a hostile road environment.</p>
