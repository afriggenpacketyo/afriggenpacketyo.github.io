          <p>As leaders from the world's largest advanced economies convene for the G7 summit in Canada, the primary concerns revolve around ongoing trade instability and geopolitical tensions, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East. Uncertainty stems from the White House's economic and foreign policies, prompting allies to question whether President Trump aligns with them on crucial geopolitical issues. With potential trade wars looming and existing tariffs in place, the summit aims to navigate these challenges, though a consensus may be difficult to achieve. The host country, Canada, has abandoned the traditional joint communique to avoid repeating the acrimonious conclusion of the 2018 summit. </p>

          <p>Prestige television and advanced technology have led to a rise in the use of the "oner," a filming technique where an episode or scene appears to be filmed in one continuous take. Emmy contenders are taking this technique to new heights, using it for fight scenes, mind warps, and examinations of crime. The key to using the oner successfully is ensuring the style does not overshadow the story. The increasing use of oners also reflects rapid technological transformation. </p>

While assisted stretching can be beneficial, consistency is key, and the sports medicine community has questions about the overall benefits of stretching. </p>

Democratic Congress members and nonprofits attribute the delay to an executive order signed by President Trump, which requires executive departments and agencies to seek approval before sending reports to the Federal Register.

          <p>After an initial reprieve, the farming industry is grappling with increased immigration enforcement, as federal officials target farms and meat packing plants. The administration has sent mixed signals about protecting agricultural workers, who often lack legal status. Farmers are seeking changes to visa programs to address labor shortages, but the administration remains focused on deporting those without legal status. This situation has created uncertainty and fear within farmworker communities. </p>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's departure, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to reshape the federal government by embedding operatives within agencies and institutionalizing its mission. The Trump administration views DOGE's work as central to its vision of streamlining the bureaucracy. While some of Musk's more bombastic plans have been blunted by legal challenges, many DOGE staffers have been converted to permanent federal positions. These changes are aimed at prioritizing efficiency and aligning the bureaucracy with Trump's policy goals. </p>
