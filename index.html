          <p>The United Kingdom is providing military planners and logisticians to assist Jordan with airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, where a severe humanitarian crisis is unfolding. This initiative comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces increasing domestic pressure, with over a third of MPs signing a letter urging the government to formally recognize a Palestinian state. While the government is accelerating efforts to deliver food and medical support, some critics have described the airdrops as largely symbolic and insufficient to address the man-made famine, advocating instead for Israel to open all border crossings for aid to enter by land.</p>

          <p>A 68-year-old dog trainer, Christopher Kennedy, was unexpectedly diagnosed with terminal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis during a routine pre-surgery X-ray, despite having no prior symptoms. As his condition rapidly deteriorated, he was given less than a year to live, leading him to reluctantly agree to a double-lung transplant, a procedure his brother had not survived. After a tense month in the hospital, he successfully underwent the transplant and has made a remarkable recovery, with his lung capacity now at 98%, allowing him to return to training hospital therapy dogs with a renewed perspective on life.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its establishment in 1953, the People's Liberation Army Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students for its undergraduate programs. The ten students who were accepted achieved top scores on their university entrance exams and expressed a desire to contribute to the country's national defense. This historic move marks a significant milestone for the institution, which has been training naval officers for over seven decades and is a key research center for military-aligned technologies.</p>

          <p>According to his great-granddaughter, the 1930s star Will Rogers was the highest-paid actor in Hollywood at the time of his death, but his true passion was being a cowboy, not a movie star. She explains that he used his film career to finance his travels and ranch life, never losing touch with his Oklahoma roots despite his fame. Rogers, who began as a trick-roper in a Wild West show, became a beloved newspaper columnist and cultural icon known for his common-man appeal, and his death in a 1935 plane crash was a moment of national mourning.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's usual methods of controlling the news cycle are proving ineffective against renewed scrutiny of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The author points to newly uncovered photos, documents, and Trump's own furious reactions as factors fueling public interest and intra-party discontent among Republicans. The piece speculates on several potential outcomes, from the story fizzling out to it becoming a major political liability for Trump, while emphasizing that the focus should remain on the victims who were failed by the justice system.</p>

          <p>A small but growing number of young Israelis are refusing mandatory military conscription in the IDF as a protest against the war in Gaza, a decision that carries severe consequences. These refusers, or "refuseniks," face imprisonment, are often branded as traitors, and risk being ostracized by friends, family, and mainstream society. The article profiles several of these teenagers, detailing their moral objections to the conflict and the personal sacrifices they make, highlighting a fringe perspective within a nation where military service is a near-universal rite of passage.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the cultural legacy of Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, and the sense of betrayal felt by those who once admired him. The author recalls how Combs, in the 1990s, became a formidable ambassador of Black cool and an icon of aspirational success, representing a new kind of unrestricted ambition. This powerful image has now been shattered by recent revelations of his cruelty and depravity, forcing a difficult re-examination of a figure who once defined a generation's dreams.</p>

          <p>As summers become hotter due to climate change, more Americans are experiencing what some call "summer depression" or a seasonal affective disorder (SAD) with a summer pattern. The condition is linked not only to the direct physiological effects of heat but also to the social isolation and lack of sunlight that result from staying indoors to avoid dangerously high temperatures. Experts express concern about the escalating mental health impacts of climate change, including disruptions to sleep, mood, and cognitive abilities.</p>
