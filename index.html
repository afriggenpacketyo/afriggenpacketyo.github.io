          <p>This article indicates that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has issued a warning regarding a potential decline in domestic company profits. This decline is attributed to ongoing trade frictions, suggesting that international trade policies are negatively impacting Japanese businesses. The warning highlights the sensitivity of the Japanese economy to global trade dynamics and the potential challenges faced by companies operating within this environment. The BOJ's statement underscores the need for businesses to adapt to changing trade conditions and for policymakers to address the underlying issues contributing to these economic pressures.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since losing the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America in San Francisco. Harris criticized the Trump administration's policies, particularly the trade war, which she described as the "greatest manmade economic crisis in modern presidential history." She accused the administration of abandoning American ideals and fostering fear, while also hinting at a potential run for California governor in 2026, as Gavin Newsom's term is expiring. The speech touched on themes of resistance against unconstitutional threats and the importance of staying active in the political arena.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amidst rising concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs potentially impacting the country's exports. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, as the global trade environment remains uncertain due to the U.S. pressuring countries to enter business deals under the threat of "reciprocal" tariffs. The BOJ's cautious approach reflects the need to balance domestic economic stability with external trade pressures, indicating a wait-and-see approach to the evolving trade landscape.</p>

          <p>Stephen Cloobeck, a wealthy Democratic businessman, is suing former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for using the phrase “proven problem solver” in his campaign materials. Cloobeck, who is also running for governor in 2026, has applied for a federal trademark of the phrase and claims Villaraigosa's use of it could cause confusion among voters. Villaraigosa's representatives have dismissed the lawsuit as ludicrous, while legal scholars suggest Cloobeck's case has little chance of success, viewing it as a political tactic rather than a legitimate legal claim.</p>

          <p>China is adopting a cautious approach to trade talks with the United States, waiting to see which of President Trump's advisors will exert the most influence on trade policy. The Trump administration's divided views on dealing with China have made Beijing reluctant to engage in serious negotiations, fearing the risk of revealing their strategies prematurely. Despite recent attempts by the U.S. to initiate trade talks, China remains hesitant until there is a clearer indication of the direction of U.S. trade policy.</p>

This decision has the potential to reshape the app economy by increasing revenue for developers and reducing fees for Apple, striking at one of Apple's major businesses.

          <p>A US district judge has referred Apple for a possible criminal contempt investigation, finding that the company willfully violated an injunction in a case brought by Epic Games. The judge stated that Apple's vice president of finance "outright lied" under oath and that the company deliberately violated the injunction to interfere with competition. This ruling stems from a 2021 case where it was decided that Apple could no longer prohibit developers from linking to their own purchasing mechanisms. Epic Games has offered to return Fortnite to the App Store if Apple extends the court's framework worldwide.</p>

The board members met with Musk and asked him to publicly acknowledge that he would dedicate more time to Tesla, however, it remains unclear if Musk was aware of succession planning.
