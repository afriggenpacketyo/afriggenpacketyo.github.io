          <p>Fan Daidi, a chemistry professor turned entrepreneur, exemplifies China's booming chemical sciences sector by commercializing innovations in collagen synthesis. As dean of Northwest University's chemical engineering school, Fan's skincare enterprise Giant Biogene has reached a $10.4 billion valuation. Her rise highlights how state-backed scientific industrialization is creating a new generation of academic tycoons. Fan and her husband Yan Jianya's combined holdings are estimated to be valued at over 40 billion yuan, with ownership in Giant Biogene and XiAn Triangle Defence, operating in pharmaceuticals and aerospace. </p>

          <p>The Mayo Clinic is using a fecal waste biobank to personalize medicine by understanding how the microbiome affects cancer patients' responses to medications. Researchers aim to identify which drugs patients are most likely to respond to by analyzing their microbiome and genes, moving away from the current regimen-based approach. This research involves a biobank of over 2,000 stool samples, with the expectation of publishing results this summer. The work is part of a broader effort to understand how the gut microbiome influences cancer treatment outcomes, with researchers experimenting with fecal transplants and other methods. </p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants seeking asylum, humanitarian parole, or care for minors in government custody to offset the costs of Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Advocates warn these fees, such as $1,000 for asylum applications and $3,500 for sponsoring unaccompanied minors, could create insurmountable financial barriers for vulnerable immigrants. Experts fear this economic pressure could force immigrants into exploitative work arrangements or push them to leave the country. While the bill is a priority for Republicans, its path to enactment is uncertain due to disagreements over government spending cuts. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to deport international students over their pro-Palestinian activism have suffered setbacks in court, with judges ordering the release of several detained scholars. The administration is seeking to deport these students, claiming their presence harms US foreign policy, leading to concerns about free speech on campuses. While these students have been released pending court decisions, the fundamental legal question of whether the government can deport noncitizens for their political speech remains unsettled. Advocates worry about the chilling effect these arrests have on free speech and academic freedom. </p>

          <p>Many Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine view a cease-fire along current front lines as a failure, reflecting nationalist discontent that could challenge the Kremlin if it accepts a peace deal. In interviews, soldiers expressed bitterness towards officials and civilians, accusing them of benefiting from the war while ignoring frontline hardships. They demand the conquest of all four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions claimed by Russia, fearing their sacrifices would be in vain otherwise. This sentiment highlights the difficulties Putin would face in ending the war on terms short of his maximalist goals, given that annexing Ukrainian regions may have limited his negotiation options. </p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike in northeastern Ukraine killed nine people and injured four others after peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials failed to produce a ceasefire agreement. The attack targeted a passenger bus in Bilopillia, near the Russian border, leading Ukrainian officials to condemn it as a deliberate war crime. The passengers were being evacuated from the city when the drone struck, with most victims being elderly women. Despite the strike, both sides agreed to a prisoner swap and discussed ceasefire proposals, though key conditions for ending the conflict remain unresolved. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan detainees accused of gang membership under the Alien Enemies Act, sending the case back to a lower court. The justices will review whether the administration has provided adequate due process protections to the migrants before deportation, potentially to a prison in El Salvador. This ruling deals a blow to the administration's efforts to swiftly deport migrants using the wartime law. The court cited the case of a man deported in error to the El Salvador prison, highlighting the high stakes for the detainees. </p>

The UK already has similar reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia.

The UK is considering this scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU, with issues such as fishing rights also expected to be discussed. </p>

          <p>President Trump seeks to reach a nuclear deal with Iran to avoid war, despite resistance from hard-line supporters demanding Iran dismantle its nuclear program. While significant gaps remain, officials are optimistic about progress in talks led by Steve Witkoff, focusing on long-term enrichment freezes and enhanced inspections. Iran insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes, and any agreement will require guarantees that the US will adhere to it. The potential deal faces opposition from neoconservatives who want complete denuclearization. </p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist mayoral candidate, is gaining traction among young, online influencers in New York City, raising questions about the power of social media clout in local elections. These influencers, typically known for shaping cultural trends, are using their platforms to support Mamdani's campaign, drawn to his progressive policies on rent and transportation. While former Governor Andrew Cuomo remains the frontrunner, Mamdani's rise is attributed to his savvy use of social media and the backing of a hip social media class. It remains to be seen whether this type of influence can translate into votes in the mayoral election. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring policy changes to expand insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.), including for military members and those insured through the Affordable Care Act.

While the White House has engaged with various stakeholders, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine reports that it has been excluded from the process.

          <p>Experts are raising concerns about Donald Trump's receipt of overseas gifts and targeted investments, describing them as "unprecedented" and potentially compromising US foreign policy. The acceptance of foreign largesse, including a $400m plane offered by Qatar and a $2bn investment from UAE-controlled funds, raises questions about conflicts of interest and the selling of American foreign policy to the highest bidder. Some argue that these actions violate the emoluments clause of the constitution and undermine ethical standards.

These cases, involving non-U.S. citizens, come as Republicans push for stricter voter registration requirements. While Trump and his allies claim widespread noncitizen voting, evidence suggests these are isolated incidents of mistakes rather than a large conspiracy.
