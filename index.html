        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that mousse-style sunscreen products may not provide effective protection against harmful UV rays. The agency sent warning letters to several companies, including popular brands Supergoop! and Vacation Inc., stating their products are unapproved drugs. Furthermore, the FDA highlighted a significant safety concern, noting that the products' packaging closely resembles whipped cream canisters. This design increases the risk of accidental ingestion by consumers, particularly children, who might mistake the sunscreen for food.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats, who left the state to prevent a quorum and block a special legislative session on redistricting, are now discussing their return. Their absence successfully stalled Republican-led efforts to pass new congressional maps that would have created five new GOP-majority districts. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has indicated he will call a second special session with the same agenda. The political standoff has highlighted deep partisan divisions over gerrymandering, with Republicans accusing Democrats of dereliction of duty and Democrats insisting they are protecting fair representation.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded dismissively to reports that Russia likely hacked the electronic filing system for U.S. federal courts, which contains sensitive and sealed documents. When questioned about the breach, Trump remarked, "Are you surprised?" and suggested that hacking is what Russia does, adding that the U.S. is "actually better at it." The revelation of the hack, which is believed to be a yearslong effort, comes just before Trump's scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump stated that he "could" bring up the security breach during their discussion.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is navigating a difficult period as star striker Alexander Isak remains determined to leave the club for Liverpool, despite Newcastle rejecting a £110m bid. Isak is currently training away from the first-team squad, creating an unsettling atmosphere as the Premier League season begins. The situation presents a complex dilemma for the club, balancing the contractual obligation of the player against the commercial reality of his high value and the potential disruption to team unity. Manager Eddie Howe has emphasized the group's togetherness, but the club faces significant challenges in replacing Isak and competing with top-tier rivals.</p>

          <p>With interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) remaining in the 4% to 5% range, these accounts offer a stable savings option with predictable returns. An analysis of current rates shows that a $75,000 deposit can generate significant interest, from approximately $794 over three months to over $16,900 for a five-year term. Because CD rates are fixed at the time of deposit, they protect savers from potential future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, unlike variable-rate accounts. This makes them an attractive, FDIC-insured vehicle for those who can lock their funds away for a set period. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is seen as a way to support its workforce financially and motivate them to shop at Walmart. This decision also serves as a strategic business maneuver to retain employees and boost sales as the company braces for potential price hikes across the economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump held virtual meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders to align their positions before his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. During the talks, Zelenskyy warned that Putin is "bluffing" about wanting peace and urged for continued sanctions and pressure on Moscow. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who helped organize the call, emphasized that any peace process must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and begin with a ceasefire. Trump threatened "very severe consequences" if Putin does not agree to end the war, while also suggesting a follow-up meeting with both Putin and Zelenskyy could occur.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while larger tech stocks faltered. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September policy meeting. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs for financing operations and expansion, and can potentially boost consumer spending. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut, a sentiment bolstered by recent economic data and political pressure on the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers predict a substantial decline in global reindeer populations by the end of the century, primarily due to climate change, with North American caribou being the most vulnerable. A new study projects that caribou populations could plummet by as much as 80% by 2100 without major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The research, which analyzed 21,000 years of data, found that reindeer have historically struggled during periods of rapid warming. The decline of these animals could have cascading ecological effects, including a reduction in tundra plant diversity and an accelerated release of soil carbon.</p>

The firm, led by former NYSE President Tom Farley, will raise $1.1 billion in an offering that was expanded due to strong investor demand. The successful IPO reflects renewed market appetite for crypto-related stocks, bolstered by a more favorable regulatory attitude from the Trump administration.

          <p>Nearly one in five student loan borrowers aged 50 and older are now seriously delinquent on their payments, a sharp increase from pre-pandemic levels. This trend coincides with the Trump administration's resumption of collection activities after a nearly five-year pause. Experts suggest older Americans may be struggling with debt taken on for their children's education or their own later-in-life studies. With the federal government poised to resume wage garnishments and potentially Social Security offsets for defaulted loans, these older borrowers face increasingly difficult financial choices as they approach retirement.

          <p>Goldman Sachs is standing by its economic analysis which concluded that U.S. consumers will ultimately bear the brunt of the administration's tariffs on Chinese goods. The forecast drew sharp criticism from President Trump, who suggested the bank should get a new economist. A Goldman economist defended the research, stating that models show consumers would absorb about two-thirds of the tariff costs by the fall, potentially pushing a key inflation metric to 3.2%. The public disagreement highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's trade policy narrative and independent economic forecasts regarding its impact on American households.

          <p>A federal judge has expressed doubt regarding the Trump administration's unprecedented lawsuit against the entire federal bench of Maryland. The lawsuit challenges a standing order that briefly pauses the deportation of migrants who are challenging their removal in court, giving them time to be heard. Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the suit is a politically motivated attempt to limit judicial power over immigration, while the Justice Department claimed the order impedes the president's enforcement authority. The presiding judge questioned why the administration pursued this extraordinary measure instead of appealing individual cases, highlighting the unusual nature of the executive branch suing a co-equal branch.</p>

The announcement comes after a contentious period for the cultural institution, during which Trump appointed himself chairman and replaced board members.

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision, clearing the path for the Trump administration to cut billions of dollars in foreign aid funding appropriated by Congress. In a 2-1 decision, the D.C. Circuit court ruled that the nonprofit groups who sued the administration lacked the legal standing to bring the case. The ruling sidestepped the core constitutional question of whether the executive branch can refuse to spend funds allocated by the legislative branch. This decision reverses a significant legal setback for the administration, which had been blocked from suspending grants that did not align with its priorities.</p>

The report, which experts say is filled with misinformation, is seen as an attempt to undermine the legal basis for U.S. climate regulations. In a related move, the National Academies of Sciences has launched a self-funded, fast-track review of climate evidence to inform policymaking. These efforts represent a broader pushback from the scientific community against the administration's promotion of unproven viewpoints and its removal of climate data from government websites.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge ruled that the suspension violated a previous injunction that blocked the government from canceling grants at the University of California system. The administration had frozen $584 million in funding, alleging the university allowed antisemitism during pro-Palestinian campus protests. The ruling represents a legal check on the administration's threats to cut federal funds from universities over student demonstrations against U.S. policy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis argues that the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force is a move from a "fascist playbook" intended to manufacture a crisis for political gain. The author contends that President Trump's justification, citing rampant crime, is contradicted by official data showing that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low. The piece suggests the action is not about public safety but about expanding executive power and creating a pretext for similar interventions in other cities. It frames the policy as being dependent on blatant lies to stoke fear and undermine truth.</p>

Despite the loss, the company's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, beating forecasts and reflecting surging demand for AI infrastructure, though some analysts noted a delay in capital expenditures as a potential weakness.

This marks the eighth consecutive report identifying severe occupational shortages, with the number of affected job types at its highest since 2018.
