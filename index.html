          <p>Florida sheriff's deputies shot and killed a man, identified as Timothy Schulz, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs, after he was apparently bitten by an alligator. Deputies initially tried to use a Taser on Schulz, who was wielding garden shears, but the situation escalated when he entered their patrol vehicle and attempted to access weapons. Schulz, who had a history of drug-related arrests, was transported to receive medical treatment after the shooting, and the incident is under investigation.</p>
