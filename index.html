            <p>Taiwan is bracing for a showdown as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) throws its full support behind a sweeping recall campaign aimed at unseating opposition lawmakers, in a bid to regain control of the legislature. The campaign – pushing for a recall petition where voters could remove the officials before their terms end – has energised pro-DPP civic groups and mobilised supporters island-wide. But analysts say it risks deepening partisan divisions and political instability at a time when the self-ruled island is facing intensified pressure from Beijing and economic uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is backing a recall campaign to oust opposition lawmakers in an effort to regain control of the legislature. The DPP accuses the opposition of creating legislative gridlock and threatening the island's security. This move risks deepening political divisions at a time when Taiwan faces increased pressure from Beijing and economic uncertainty. The opposition KMT currently holds a majority in the legislature, making it difficult for the DPP to advance its agenda.</p>
