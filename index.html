          <h2>US to Impose 25% Tariff and Additional Penalty on India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 09:13:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods starting August 1, citing unfair trade practices and India's economic ties with Russia. The administration also plans an unspecified additional "penalty" related to India's purchase of Russian military equipment and energy. This move is part of a broader strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, though economists question its effectiveness and potential impact on American consumers. The action escalates trade tensions and reflects growing rhetoric against nations trading with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has affirmed that the August 1st deadline for implementing widespread "reciprocal" tariffs will not be delayed. This decision follows a previous extension and sets the stage for new import taxes on numerous countries, with rates as high as 50% for some nations like Brazil. The administration suggests these tariffs provide leverage in negotiations, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated they could be temporary if countries negotiate in good faith. Several partners, including the EU and Japan, have already negotiated lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least seven people were killed and 13 wounded after armed members of the MS-13 gang attacked a funeral for a rival Barrio 18 gang member in Guatemala City. The assailants arrived on motorcycles, opened fire on attendees, and then fled the scene. Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez attributed the violence to the ongoing and brutal rivalry between the two gangs for territorial control. He also criticized police officers assigned to monitor the high-risk event for abandoning their posts, promising a full investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and reversing a 0.5% contraction from the first quarter. The growth was largely driven by a significant decrease in imports, a statistical anomaly caused by companies reacting to new tariffs, and a rebound in consumer spending. Despite the strong headline number, some underlying indicators suggest a potential slowdown, and the Federal Reserve is still expected to hold interest rates steady. The report provides a mixed but resilient picture of the economy amid trade policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Finance Minister Lan Foan has announced that the government will accelerate fiscal spending to stimulate domestic demand and address local government debt issues. The plan includes expediting the issuance of ultra-long-term bonds and special-purpose bonds, echoing a recent call from the Politburo for a more proactive fiscal policy. In the first half of 2025, China issued a record 7.88 trillion yuan in government bonds to support its economy. These measures are designed to bolster economic activity and ensure financial stability amid ongoing challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Russia triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, leading to evacuations in coastal areas of Hawaii. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center recorded waves several feet high and urged residents in low-lying areas to move to higher ground, causing significant traffic. While the initial tsunami warning was later downgraded to an advisory, officials cautioned that dangerous currents could persist for hours. The event also prompted advisories for the U.S. West Coast and parts of Canada, with authorities emphasizing public safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Russia's Far East, scientists are explaining the nature of the resulting tsunami. Experts note the quake occurred on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," where the movement of tectonic plates can displace massive amounts of water. They clarify that while powerful, this event is less energetic than the quakes that caused the devastating 2004 and 2011 tsunamis, resulting in smaller waves. Tsunami specialists emphasize that these events are more like ocean floods than surf waves, with the entire water column rising and posing a significant coastal hazard.</p>

          <p>Apple is facing increasing concern from investors over its perceived lack of a clear strategy for artificial intelligence, especially as competitors like Google and OpenAI make aggressive moves. The company's stock has underperformed compared to other tech giants this year, and the delay of its next-generation Siri has added to the uncertainty. While Apple's strong ecosystem and profitable services business provide a buffer, analysts warn that it needs to present a compelling AI solution to avoid losing ground in the long term. The pressure is mounting for Apple to demonstrate how it will compete in the next era of computing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has criticized the world's largest Earth-imaging satellite fleet, the Dove constellation operated by Planet Labs. The researchers described the small, thruster-less satellites as "low-cost orbital landmines" that pose a significant threat to space safety. Their analysis claims that many of the satellites have deorbited in an uncontrolled manner and that numerous others in public databases have incorrect or missing orbital data. The critique highlights growing international tensions over the management of low Earth orbit and the risks posed by large satellite constellations.</p>

The groups will use a comprehensive review of scientific literature to create evidence-based guides for Covid, flu, and RSV vaccines. The effort aims to provide a trusted, science-based resource for patients and healthcare providers, and potentially influence insurance coverage for immunizations.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Robert Reich contends that a dangerous silencing of media criticism is occurring in the United States due to corporate fear of Donald Trump's political power. He points to the departure of columnist Eduardo Porter from The Washington Post and the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show by Paramount as prime examples. Reich argues that powerful corporations and their leaders are capitulating to avoid potential retaliation against their business interests from a vindictive administration. He warns that this self-censorship by media outlets and other institutions represents a grave threat to American democracy.</p>

          <p>This article explains the recent resurgence of the "meme stock" phenomenon, which has caused volatile trading for companies like Kohl's, Krispy Kreme, and GoPro. These stocks are typically inexpensive, well-known household names, and are often heavily shorted by institutional investors. The frenzy is driven by retail traders, often coordinating on social media forums, who buy up shares to create a "short squeeze," forcing short sellers to buy back shares at a higher price. This feedback loop creates wild price swings that are disconnected from the company's actual financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>
