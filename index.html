          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the location of a significant explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility, also resulted in multiple grass fires and the evacuation of a one-mile radius. Seven people remain unaccounted for, and investigations have revealed the business lacked the proper local licenses to store fireworks on the agricultural property. The ATF is assisting Cal Fire in the ongoing investigation into the cause.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign a major legislative package that introduces significant tax cuts, primarily benefiting the wealthy, while imposing new restrictions on social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The bill also allocates substantial new funding for aggressive immigration enforcement, including mass deportations, drawing sharp criticism from Democrats and immigrant rights groups. Proponents argue the changes will reduce waste, but analyses project millions could lose healthcare and food assistance. The legislation is also expected to increase the national debt by over $3 trillion in the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Trump used the term "shylocks" when discussing bankers, a word widely recognized as an antisemitic slur originating from Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." When questioned, the president claimed he was unaware of the term's offensive meaning, stating he only understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates. The Anti-Defamation League and other critics condemned the language as irresponsible and dangerous, highlighting its history as a harmful trope about Jewish people and greed.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience has outlined five "toxic" foods he avoids feeding his children to promote better long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and bacon because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks, and deep-fried foods, suggesting healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and air-fried vegetables to instill healthier eating habits from a young age.</p>

The deduction has income caps, and analyses suggest it will not help the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal income tax liability.

          <p>New industry data reveals that one in every ten cars sold in the United Kingdom during June was manufactured in China, marking a significant increase in market share. The growth is driven by new brands like BYD and established ones like MG, with their market share for the first half of the year rising to over 8% from 5% in previous years. This surge comes as other Western countries, including the U.S. and EU nations, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. The UK has not followed suit, creating a major opportunity for Chinese automakers to expand their presence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton expressed optimism for a "strong weekend" at the British Grand Prix after his Ferrari showed competitive pace during Friday's practice sessions at Silverstone. McLaren's Lando Norris was fastest, but Hamilton finished third, closely behind his teammate Charles Leclerc, suggesting Ferrari can challenge the front-runners. The performance is a positive sign for Hamilton, who has had a challenging start to his first season with Ferrari but holds a record nine wins at his home race. Championship leader Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen finished fourth and fifth, respectively.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is reportedly in discussions to launch a new left-wing political party in the UK, a move that gained momentum after MP Zarah Sultana quit Labour to join the effort. While Corbyn confirmed discussions are ongoing, he indicated that the foundations are still being laid and no formal launch has been set. Polling suggests such a party could capture up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and younger voters. The potential new party highlights a significant gap in the political landscape to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be proscribed as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge rejected its request for a temporary block on the government's decision. The ban, which takes effect at midnight, will make it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Palestine Action, known for tactics like spraying red paint on buildings of weapons manufacturers, argued the ban is an "authoritarian abuse" of power.

The facility is a key part of the Trump administration's and Florida's strategy to increase immigration enforcement, with officials hoping its harsh reputation will deter illegal immigration.</p>

Despite serving on the front lines, these soldiers lack basic rights afforded to their heterosexual comrades, as Ukraine does not recognize same-sex partnerships. This means in cases of injury or death, their partners have no legal standing for medical decisions, inheritance, or compensation. While discrimination still exists within the ranks, attitudes in the military and broader society are slowly shifting, though legislative progress on a civil partnerships bill remains stalled.</p>

The company resisted demands for a larger payout and an apology, but agreed to the settlement to resolve the protracted legal battle.

The stomach of a competitive eater can become permanently stretched, potentially impairing its ability to contract and empty properly. In the short term, ingesting huge amounts of high-fat, high-sodium food like hot dogs can cause gastrointestinal distress, bloating, and dangerous spikes in blood pressure. While the long-term effects are not well-studied, immediate dangers include choking, aspirating on vomit, or tearing the esophagus, which have led to deaths in past contests.</p>

The suit claims agents are targeting people based on their appearance in raids on known hubs for Latino workers, such as hardware store parking lots and street vendor corners. Advocates argue agents are arresting people who appear to be Latino without establishing reasonable suspicion of their immigration status, a violation of constitutional protections.
