The operation has involved a significant military buildup in the region, including warships and B-52 bombers, and has reportedly caused internal tensions, with Admiral Avlin Holsey stepping down from his command after expressing reservations about the ongoing military operations.</p>

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," with writer Harlan Coben, centering the story on a skilled female surgeon rather than her sex appeal. Witherspoon explains that her upbringing watching James Bond films, where she questioned the roles of women, inspired her to create characters with unique skill sets. Through her production company, Hello Sunshine, she continues to champion complex female-led stories, addressing what she sees as a persistent gap in Hollywood for such narratives.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a significant downturn after two U.S. regional banks reported exposure to bad loans and alleged fraud, sparking fears about the health of the private credit market. The news caused a sell-off in banking shares across Europe and Asia, with investors concerned about potential credit quality issues following a period of high interest rates. In response to the market jitters, investors moved towards safe-haven assets, pushing the price of gold to a new record high amid rising volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released proposals aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable, but they fall significantly short of the president's campaign pledge to make the procedure free. The plan includes federal guidance for employers to offer optional fertility coverage and discounts on some IVF medications through a new government portal. However, the proposals lack new subsidies or mandates, meaning most patients will see minimal cost relief, disappointing both accessibility advocates and some religious conservatives who oppose the procedure.</p>

          <p>With gold and silver prices reaching record highs, this article offers guidance for investors looking to enter the precious metals market safely.

The CNBC Investing Club, which holds DuPont shares, plans to retain its stock in both the parent company and the new Qnity entity, viewing the latter as a promising long-term investment due to its strong ties to the growing semiconductor industry.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Senate Democrats are pursuing a politically damaging strategy by prolonging the government shutdown over issues like Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid coverage. The author contends that the party is in a weak negotiating position and that public opinion may shift to blaming them for the stalemate. The piece suggests Democrats are guided by ideology rather than rational political calculation, failing to adopt a more centrist approach that could win broader support on key issues like immigration and healthcare spending.</p>

The choice of venue is notable given Hungary's often adversarial stance toward Ukraine, including its opposition to Ukraine's EU membership bid and criticism of Western military support.</p>
