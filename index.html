          <p>New York City mayoral contenders Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo are engaged in a heated debate over their respective records and current positions on supporting law enforcement. This clash comes in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting in midtown Manhattan, which tragically resulted in four fatalities, including a police officer. Cuomo has sharply criticized Mamdani, the Democratic Party nominee, for his past comments advocating to defund the NYPD, accusing him of being "anti-police" and misunderstanding public safety needs. Mamdani, while addressing the renewed scrutiny, has slammed Cuomo for politicizing the tragedy and attempting to use past statements for political gain, emphasizing his current public safety platform and commitment to the city's future. The political discourse underscores the sensitive and critical nature of public safety as a central issue in the mayoral race.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan are reportedly discussing scenarios for the potential use of US nuclear weapons in an East Asian contingency, aiming to strengthen the US nuclear umbrella protecting Japan. This development, building on earlier "Guidelines for Extended Deterrence," seeks to alleviate Tokyo's anxieties regarding support for Taiwan's defense amidst intensifying military activities by China, North Korea, and Russia. While experts suggest it may ease Japan's concerns about potential involvement in a Taiwan conflict, the move is anticipated to provoke a negative reaction from Beijing. The ongoing dialogue underscores the complex geopolitical dynamics and security challenges in the region.</p>

          <p>Figma, the design software developer previously targeted for acquisition by Adobe, has successfully priced its Initial Public Offering (IPO) at $33 per share, exceeding its anticipated range. The company's stock is set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "FIG," raising $1.2 billion primarily for existing stockholders. This move capitalizes on a gradually reopening tech IPO market, with Figma now valued at $19.3 billion after its $20 billion Adobe acquisition deal collapsed due to regulatory objections. The article highlights Figma's strong financial performance, with significant revenue growth and a shift towards profitability, indicating investor confidence in its market position.

K. was found guilty of participating in the execution by forcing the pilot into a metal cage, marking the first conviction related to this high-profile act of brutality. The 32-year-old, already serving sentences for his role in the 2015 Paris and 2016 Brussels terror attacks, was ordered to pay compensation to the victim's family.

          <p>The Interstate 95 corridor, from New York City to Washington, D.C., is preparing for dangerous flash flooding on Thursday, with rainfall rates potentially reaching three inches per hour and isolated areas expecting up to eight inches. New York City has issued a travel advisory, urging residents to avoid travel and those in basements to seek higher ground. Simultaneously, over 50 million Americans across 11 states in the South are under extreme heat warnings, with heat indices soaring to 110-120 degrees Fahrenheit. The forecast also includes continued downpours in Ruidoso, New Mexico, which has already experienced multiple flash flood events this month.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight en route from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was forced to make an emergency landing at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport after experiencing "significant" in-flight turbulence. Twenty-five of the 288 passengers and crew members on board were transported to local hospitals for evaluation and care, though no fatalities were reported. Preliminary data indicates the plane encountered intense turbulence over Wyoming, with one passenger reporting a drop of over 1,000 feet. The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident, which underscores the unpredictable nature of severe weather conditions during air travel.</p>

Challenged by 12 states and five small businesses, the case questions the president's claim that trade deficits and illicit drug flow constitute national emergencies justifying such broad powers.

The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and allied groups had framed the campaign as a battle to "resist China, protect Taiwan." Analysts suggest that a successful recall, implying widespread anti-China sentiment, could have prompted a strong backlash from Beijing, potentially leading to an early confrontation. While immediate tensions are eased, the outcome still points to underlying political divisions and future uncertainties in Taiwan's relationship with mainland China.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has denied disaster assistance requests for three Kentucky counties severely impacted by spring storms, deeming them ineligible for federal support. This decision is part of a broader Trump administration effort to shift disaster response burdens to states and reduce federal funding, exemplified by previous denials to Maryland and the termination of a multi-billion-dollar grant program. Critics, including state attorneys general, warn that these cuts leave communities vulnerable to escalating climate-fueled catastrophes and create severe recovery gaps, as local emergency management departments are often under-resourced.</p>
