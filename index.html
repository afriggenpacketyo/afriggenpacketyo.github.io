          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek has won the Wimbledon women's singles title, her sixth major championship. She defeated American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory, a rare 'double bagel' in a Grand Slam final that hasn't occurred at Wimbledon since 1911. Swiatek, previously known as a clay-court specialist, demonstrated her adaptability and dominance on grass throughout the tournament. The 24-year-old is the first Polish player to win a Wimbledon singles title in the Open era.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures peaking at 33C. The extreme heat has led to hosepipe bans for millions in England and wildfire warnings across Scotland, where a blaze has been active for two days. The conditions have also disrupted travel and sporting events, including the Wimbledon finals. Health authorities have issued amber heat alerts, warning of increased health risks, particularly for the elderly and vulnerable.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic humorously portrays former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino resigning from his post to independently investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case. The piece imagines Bongino believing that true insight into government conspiracies can only be found far from any official capacity, preferably from a podcast studio. The parody mocks conspiracy theory culture by having the character claim the official evidence release is unconvincing and that he must get to the bottom of it himself.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis has ranked the economic strength of all 50 U.S. states, evaluating their preparedness for a potential recession amid risks from federal budget cuts and trade tariffs. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina topped the list, credited with strong growth, solid state finances, and diverse economies. The study considered traditional metrics like GDP and job growth, as well as each state's dependence on federal spending and exposure to international trade disputes, particularly with China.

          <h2>Companies Utilize Foreign Trade Zones to Mitigate Tariff Costs Amid Trade Disputes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. companies are increasingly using federally sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce the financial impact of tariffs. These zones allow businesses to import materials and assemble products in a 'tariff bubble,' with duties only being paid when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy, which dates back to the 1930s, helps preserve cash flow during periods of trade uncertainty. However, a recent executive order has eliminated the 'inverted tariff' benefit, increasing costs for some manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of federal records shows that FEMA repeatedly approved requests to remove buildings at Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, from its 100-year flood map in the years leading up to a catastrophic flood that killed 27 people. The exemptions from the 'Special Flood Hazard Area' designation loosened regulations and insurance requirements for the camp, which operated and expanded in a known flood plain. Experts find it disturbing that a facility responsible for children would seek such exemptions, raising questions about regulatory oversight.</p>

          <p>Russia's recent escalation in drone and missile attacks on Ukraine is being driven by expanded domestic drone production and clear strategic goals, according to military experts. With less reliance on foreign suppliers, Russia can now launch massive assaults aimed at overwhelming Ukrainian air defenses. Analysts believe the strategy has two main objectives: to destroy Ukraine's military-industrial capabilities and to terrorize the civilian population, thereby pressuring the Ukrainian government. These intensified attacks are seen as preparations for a potential new summer offensive.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's visit to central Texas after last week's deadly floods, political analysts are discussing the nature of his administration's federal disaster response. Panelists on 'Washington Week With The Atlantic' noted that Trump's approach differs from past presidents, focusing more on mobilizing resources rather than connecting empathetically with victims on the ground. The discussion highlighted the administration's preference for scaling back the federal role and relying more heavily on state and local officials to manage emergency situations.</p>

Patterson suggests that Kohberger, an arrogant and socially awkward criminology student, was undone by 'tunnel vision' during the act, which caused him to make a key mistake: leaving a knife sheath at the scene. This error ultimately provided the DNA evidence that led to his arrest. Kohberger recently pleaded guilty to the four murders to avoid the death penalty.</p>

Issues for the new party include a lack of a clear platform, Musk's own high public unfavorability rating, and the challenge of building a political organization from scratch.</p>
