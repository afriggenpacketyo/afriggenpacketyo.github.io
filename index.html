          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 13:51:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump is framing the ongoing government shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to slash federal agencies he considers political tools of the Democratic party. He plans to meet with OMB Director Russell Vought, a key figure in Project 2025, to identify potential cuts that could become permanent. This stance follows the administration's move to freeze billions in funding for infrastructure and climate projects in Democratic-leaning states, signaling an intent to leverage the shutdown for political and ideological goals. The White House has also warned that thousands of federal workers could face layoffs rather than furloughs.</p>

          <p>The captain of an oil tanker, believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet" used to circumvent sanctions, has been charged by French authorities for refusing naval orders. The Chinese national was unable to provide coherent information about the ship's flag, which has changed multiple times to obscure its connection to Russian oil exports. This incident highlights the ongoing efforts by Western nations to enforce sanctions imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow's elaborate methods to evade them. The vessel is currently anchored near Saint-Nazaire as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>At least eight people, including three police officers and five civilians, have been killed during violent protests in the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, Muzaffarabad. The demonstrations, which began on Monday, were sparked by public anger over lucrative state benefits for the political elite, such as free electricity and expensive vehicles. In response to the escalating clashes, authorities have shut down internet services and warned local media against covering the events. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has offered to establish a committee to investigate the violence and initiate dialogue with the protesters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling suggests that President Trump's support among Latino voters, a key demographic in his 2024 victory, is eroding, primarily due to economic concerns like high grocery and housing costs. A New York Times/Sienna poll shows 69% of Hispanics disapprove of his job performance, and a majority believe he has worsened the economy. Despite this decline in Republican approval, the data also indicates that the Democratic party has not made significant gains with this voter bloc. Analysts suggest that Democrats need to articulate a clear value proposition for Latino families rather than solely criticizing the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally notified Congress that it considers the United States to be in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, which it has designated as "terrorist organizations." A memo sent to lawmakers on Thursday frames this determination as a necessary step to protect American citizens and national security interests. This declaration is based on the president's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash deal. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental Petroleum plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO, Vicki Hollub, believes will allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal deepens the existing financial relationship between the two companies, with Berkshire already holding a significant stake in Occidental. (not investment advice)</p>

Alexander, who had previously served 23 years in prison, later died from his injuries after his leg was amputated.

          <p>While hundreds of thousands of federal workers face furloughs or work without immediate pay during a government shutdown, members of Congress and the president continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation, meaning it does not require annual renewal by Congress. In contrast, most federal agencies are governed by the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending without congressional approval, leading to the suspension of non-essential services. Although congressional staffers may be deemed essential, their pay is also delayed until the government reopens.</p>

This unprecedented accretion event, observed in an object named Cha 1107-7626, is blurring the lines between how planets and stars are thought to form. The object, located about 620 light-years away, is roughly one to two million years old and has a mass five to ten times that of Jupiter. This discovery suggests that some planetary-mass objects may form more like stars, growing through intense episodes of matter consumption driven by magnetic activity.</p>

          <p>This commentary article from The Atlantic argues that the political right is creating a martyr figure out of the assassinated activist Charlie Kirk, mirroring how the left elevated George Floyd in 2020. The author contends that just as Floyd's death was used to advance a wide range of political agendas, Kirk's memory is now being invoked to justify illiberal actions and silence opposition, including calls from politicians to fire individuals who speak ill of him. The piece draws a parallel between the adoption of "1619 Project" curricula after 2020 and a new push for Turning Point USA chapters in schools. It concludes by cautioning against reducing complex individuals into one-dimensional saints for political gain.</p>

          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned following a disagreement with the Trump administration over a gift for King Charles III. Sources indicate Arrington resisted a request to take an original Eisenhower sword from the museum's collection to present to the British monarch during a state visit. He argued that the artifact was the property of the American people and instead offered to help procure a replica. Ultimately, a Cadet Saber from West Point was gifted, but the dispute reportedly created tension with some administration officials, leading to Arrington's departure from his post.</p>

          <p>Carlos Cruz, who fled El Salvador in 1979 just before its civil war, has become a successful restaurateur in Baltimore, owning three popular establishments. Starting his career as a dishwasher, Cruz learned the industry from the ground up and eventually opened restaurants in Puerto Rico before settling in Maryland. His Baltimore businesses, including Bayside Cantina and Chilango's, are known for their Tex-Mex cuisine and have become local favorites, even catering for the Baltimore Orioles for many years. Cruz attributes his success to the lessons of hard work and respect taught by his parents and the support of his family.</p>

          <p>Renowned primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall has passed away at the age of 91 while on a speaking tour. Goodall revolutionized the field of primatology in the 1960s with her groundbreaking research in Tanzania, where she discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools, a behavior previously thought to be exclusively human. After witnessing widespread deforestation and its impact on chimpanzee populations, she transitioned from a scientist to a full-time activist in 1986. Through the Jane Goodall Institute and her Roots and Shoots program, she spent decades traveling the world, advocating for conservation and inspiring action to protect the environment.</p>

          <p>At least two people have been killed in Morocco after police reportedly opened fire during youth-led demonstrations against government spending priorities. The protests, organized under the banner "GenZ 212," erupted over the government's decision to fund stadiums for the 2030 FIFA World Cup instead of investing in public services like hospitals amid high youth unemployment. The deaths occurred near Agadir when protesters allegedly tried to storm a police station. This marks a significant escalation in the nationwide unrest that has also seen protests in major cities like Rabat and Casablanca, with hundreds of people detained by authorities.</p>

Democratic lawmakers have condemned the decision as political retribution intended to punish their constituents during the funding impasse.

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker has reflected on the decision to end the "Sex and the City" revival, "And Just Like That," suggesting it was a choice made out of respect for the series and its audience.

Parker is also focusing on her literary work with her book imprint, SJP Lit. Her latest selection is "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 1600s Amsterdam.</p>

SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, issued a sharp rebuke, stating that such creations are trained on the work of human performers without permission or compensation, thereby devaluing human artistry and threatening livelihoods.

          <p>The English Premier League is considering replacing its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which have been criticized by some clubs for limiting investment. Chief Executive Richard Masters confirmed that a decision on adopting an "alternative system" is approaching, likely in November. The proposed new model is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's regulations, which would limit a club's spending on wages and transfers to a percentage of its total revenue, likely 85%. The goal is to align with European standards while still allowing for the investment that has historically driven the league's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

According to experts, the ranking is less about daily joy and more about a deep sense of contentment derived from a well-functioning society that provides strong social support. Public institutions like Helsinki's central library, which offers extensive free services, exemplify the country's commitment to equality and opportunity. This social contract, combined with a strong connection to nature and cultural practices like sauna, contributes to a high quality of life and a feeling that citizens are well cared for.</p>
