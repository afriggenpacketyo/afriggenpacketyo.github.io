          <h2>New Ceasefire Proposal Emerges for Israel and Hamas Conflict</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 03:05:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new ceasefire plan has been proposed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, envisioning a truce lasting five to seven years. The proposal includes the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon at the national and regional level, although Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in the future governance of Gaza. The last ceasefire collapsed a month ago, and while it's too early to assess the likelihood of success, the source described the current mediation effort as serious and said Hamas had shown "unprecedented flexibility".</p>

          <p>President Trump is currently engaged in a nine-front battle, targeting elite institutions he has long resented, including top private universities, law firms, and the media. He is pressuring the Federal Reserve, challenging court rulings, and investigating former aides, while also influencing Hill Republicans and the Kennedy Center. Trump's approach involves using Truth Social as a weapon and pushing for policy changes on various issues, from student loans to shower pressure. The president is also focused on trade, particularly with China, and is confronting international figures like Volodymyr Zelenskyy. </p>

          <p>The military regime in Burkina Faso alleges its intelligence service thwarted a coup attempt planned by individuals in Ivory Coast, with the aim of sowing chaos in the country. Interim President Ibrahim Traore, who came to power in a 2022 coup, has frequently accused Ivory Coast of harboring his opponents. According to the Security Minister, the plot was to culminate in an assault on the presidency on April 16th, involving soldiers recruited by the nation's enemies. Since taking power, Traore's junta has cracked down on perceived opponents, with arrests and kidnappings becoming common, amid ongoing jihadi violence in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Commerce Department plans to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. This decision follows an investigation initiated by major solar equipment producers seeking protection for their US operations. The tariffs target companies allegedly benefiting from Chinese subsidies and dumping unfairly cheap products in the US market. The countervailing and anti-dumping duties vary by company and country, with some Cambodian exporters facing the highest duties due to perceived lack of cooperation with the investigation.</p>

This move follows pressure on the government to disclose the figures, with sources stating the public should be better informed. There were over 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of last year, an increase attributed to early releases, difficulties in deportations, and human rights appeals. The most common nationalities among foreign criminals living in the community are expected to be Albanians, Romanians, and Poles, with common offenses including drug production, theft, and violent assault.</p>

Stewards cited driving standards guidelines, emphasizing Piastri's right to room at the corner. Verstappen, known for hard racing and pushing the rules, chose not to comment, while his team principal called the penalty "very harsh". The new guidelines, influenced by Verstappen's racing style, were tested, and this time, his approach didn't succeed, suggesting he may adapt his strategy in the future.</p>

          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline after President Trump intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates. Trump's criticism comes as his own tariff plans have fueled market sell-offs and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell sharply, and the dollar index reached its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices hit a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets, and Trump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term, with reports suggesting he considered firing him.</p>

          <p>India and the US have reported progress in bilateral trade deal negotiations following a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice-President JD Vance in Delhi.

Despite a warm personal relationship between Modi and Trump, the US president has criticized India's high tariffs. In addition to trade, the leaders discussed cooperation in defense, strategic technologies, and energy, with Modi looking forward to welcoming Trump to India for the Quad summit later this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been ordered to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after a federal judge granted temporary restraining orders on their behalf. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), potentially leading to deportation. The lawsuit argues that ICE's actions coerce students into abandoning their studies despite not violating their status. A hearing is set for Thursday to further address the matter.</p>

          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from across party lines visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for the spring festival. The shrine, which honors Japan's war dead including wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, is a source of diplomatic tension with China and South Korea. The visit occurred a day after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the shrine, though he is not expected to visit in person.
