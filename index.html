          <p>The post-Assad transitional government in Syria is facing criticism over its approach to justice for war crimes committed during the country's civil war. Controversy erupted after the government's Committee for Civil Peace released several former Assad regime soldiers, including one allegedly linked to the 2013 Tadamon massacre, in the name of reconciliation. Human rights groups and Syrian activists are concerned that the newly established transitional justice commissions are too narrowly focused on Assad-era crimes, potentially ignoring atrocities committed by other factions. The lack of transparency and slow progress have eroded public trust, leading to fears of vigilante justice.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of President Trump's major economic bill proposes a new excise tax on wind and solar projects, which could significantly impact the renewable energy industry. According to an analysis by the American Clean Power Association, the tax is estimated to raise consumer energy prices and cost clean energy businesses billions by 2036. The bill also accelerates the phasing out of existing tax credits for renewables. The provisions have drawn criticism from the renewable energy sector, manufacturing unions, and even some conservatives, who warn it could stifle domestic energy development and lead to substantial job losses.

          <p>The U.S. is experiencing a rise in deaths within its immigration detention system, with the recent passing of two men from Cuba and Canada bringing the fiscal year's total to 13. This pace suggests 2025 could become one of the deadliest years on record for immigrants in federal custody. Advocacy groups and attorneys attribute the increase to deteriorating conditions inside a system strained by an aggressive deportation agenda, with facilities holding migrants at 140% of their stated capacity. Critics argue the system is collapsing under the pressure of the administration's high daily detention targets.</p>

The concept aims to create a new model for urban food distribution, though it is part of a broader, more socialist-leaning platform that has drawn both support and criticism.

This decision follows months of lobbying by Syria's new leadership, which has argued that the sanctions hinder reconstruction and economic recovery after the civil war.

          <h2>Trump Administration Delays Plan to Cut Access to Key Hurricane Forecasting Data</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a plan to cut off forecasters' access to a crucial satellite data program used for hurricane prediction. The initial announcement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had alarmed scientists, who warned that losing the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data could set forecasting back decades. The administration cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the planned cut. Following a request from NASA, the suspension has been delayed until the end of July, though the long-term fate of the data access remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities discovered 20 bodies, many of them decapitated, on a highway bridge in the state of Sinaloa. The gruesome finding is linked to a violent internal war between factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel. The conflict pits loyalists of the "Chapitos," sons of the infamous Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, against followers of co-founder Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, who was captured last year. The escalating violence has resulted in over 1,200 deaths, with rival factions using brutal torture methods and leaving bodies in public as a show of force.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration investigation has found that Harvard University violated federal civil rights law by failing to adequately protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment on campus. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' report states the university was at times "deliberately indifferent" to a pattern of unchecked discrimination following the events of October 7, 2023. This finding puts Harvard at risk of losing federal funding.

Before that point, he was batting just .188 with one home run. Since then, he has hit over .300 with 12 home runs and a major-league-leading 47 RBIs, re-establishing himself as a crucial part of the Dodgers' lineup.</p>

While the Trump administration has stated its focus is on deporting criminals, the data shows a recent reversal, with non-criminal detainees now outnumbering those with criminal records.

          <p>Dusty Johnson, South Dakota's sole representative in the U.S. House, has announced he will run for governor in the next election. Johnson, a Republican who has held the congressional seat since 2019, is positioning himself with priorities like cutting property taxes and making education more affordable. He is known for taking some moderate stances and occasionally voting against former President Trump's positions. Johnson is entering what could be a competitive Republican primary, potentially challenging the incumbent governor, Larry Rhoden, who took over after Kristi Noem joined the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify examines the significant increase in people claiming health and disability benefits in the UK, which has grown from three million to four million since 2019. The rise is largely fueled by an increase in claimants citing mental health conditions, which now account for 44% of all claims. While the exact causes are debated, researchers point to factors like the rising state pension age keeping more people in the "working-age" category for longer. Another factor may be improved public awareness of the benefits system following the pandemic and cost of living crisis.</p>
