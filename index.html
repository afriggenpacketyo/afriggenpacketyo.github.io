            <p>All 15 counties in Arizona have initiated the process of verifying and removing non-citizens from their voter rolls, affecting nearly 50,000 registrants who did not provide proof of U.S. citizenship. This action follows a lawsuit filed by America First Legal (AFL) on behalf of EZAZ.org, arguing that counties were not adhering to state laws requiring proof of citizenship for voting. The counties are now collaborating with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to verify the citizenship status of registered voters. The effort aims to ensure election integrity by removing ineligible voters and potentially enfranchising eligible federal-only voters.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry urged the U.S. to 'completely abolish' reciprocal tariffs, calling them a 'wrongful action' and advocating for resolution through equal dialogue. This statement followed the U.S. granting tariff exemptions on some tech products. China views the exemptions as a 'small step' and is assessing their impact. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that there are currently no plans for President Trump and President Xi Jinping to communicate. Chinese media and social media are portraying the exemptions as a retreat by the U.S. government.</p>
