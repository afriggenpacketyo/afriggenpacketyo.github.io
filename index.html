          <p>Eighteen individuals sustained injuries in a knife attack at Hamburg's main railway station, leading to the arrest of a 39-year-old German woman. Police investigations suggest the suspect has a history of mental illness, with no indications of political motives or substance influence. The victims, ranging from 19 to 85 years old, received varying degrees of injuries, including life-threatening ones, and the incident occurred between platforms accessible via a busy road. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed shock and commended the emergency services for their prompt response to the shocking attack.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point following his administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Recent changes include disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books related to diversity from Naval Academy libraries. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these actions undermine education and indoctrinate students instead of encouraging debate. Trump, who avoided the Vietnam War draft, previously dismissed military academy leadership, alleging leftist ideology infiltration, and his 2020 appearance at West Point raised health concerns.</p>

          <p>Experts are attempting to revitalize Florida's declining coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a resilient species, in the Florida Keys. The reefs have suffered a 90% decline in healthy coral cover due to climate change and record ocean heat. The project, involving multiple organizations, aims to identify and propagate the most resilient corals to help rebuild the reef ecosystem, which provides essential habitat for marine life. Scientists hope that even a small percentage of surviving corals can contribute to future recovery efforts in the ecologically fragile area.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering ending federal control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially taking them public, a move supported by investor Bill Ackman. The plan could benefit investors but raises concerns about disrupting the mortgage market and increasing mortgage rates. Critics, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn that privatization could reward Wall Street at the expense of homebuyers. The government took control of the firms after the 2008 financial crisis, and ending the conservatorship would require careful planning to ensure stability in the housing market.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that the sensitivity experienced in human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish from approximately 500 million years ago. Scientists initially misidentified Anatolepis, an early vertebrate fossil, as an arthropod. Further investigation revealed similarities between the armor of ancient fish and vertebrate teeth, suggesting a shared purpose of sensing the environment. By examining modern-day fish embryos, researchers found nerves in tooth-like scales, indicating that the armor of ancient fish allowed them to sense their surroundings, a trait inherited by human teeth.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council secured a court order to prevent striking refuse workers from blocking waste vehicles from leaving depots, as uncollected waste accumulates on the streets. The dispute centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the Unite union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress. The union insists its members are conducting lawful and peaceful pickets, while the council emphasizes its public health duty to clear waste. The court order is set to last until a further legal hearing, as the strike continues to disrupt rubbish collections.</p>

          <p>Women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) face a difficult decision when planning for pregnancy, as contraceptive medication, a primary treatment, poses a dilemma. PMDD affects up to 8% of women, causing intense emotional and physical symptoms before menstruation, with a long average diagnosis time. Many women are scared to come off the pill, as they do not want the symptoms to return. More research is needed into PMDD to give women more options that isn't just taking the contraceptive pill.</p>

          <h2>Young Chinese Delay Retirement Plans Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>

          <p>Young people in China are postponing retirement plans due to economic uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures. Many feel that focusing on long-term retirement planning is impractical amidst immediate challenges. While the government encourages participation in the new personal pension system, young employees prioritize current circumstances over distant financial goals. The trend reflects broader concerns about China's slowing economy and demographic challenges, making it difficult for young workers to prioritize retirement savings.</p>
