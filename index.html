          <p>President Trump's policies restricting international students, initially focused on Harvard University, are impacting numerous US schools.

Trump's administration also threatened Columbia University's accreditation over alleged antisemitism, underscoring a broader culture war targeting elite education. While Trump has suggested Chinese students are welcome following a trade deal, the overall impact of these measures on international students remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his retrial, marking a partial verdict after tense jury deliberations.

This verdict follows Weinstein's initial 2020 conviction being overturned, with the retrial including new charges. The charges stem from accusations dating back to 2017, which ignited the #MeToo movement, and the women involved have shared their experiences, highlighting the personal costs of coming forward. </p>
