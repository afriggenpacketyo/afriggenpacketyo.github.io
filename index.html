          <p>Japan has begun requiring pre-arrival tuberculosis screenings for foreigners planning to stay longer than three months, starting with individuals from the Philippines and Nepal. Vietnam is expected to be added to the list in September, followed by Indonesia, Myanmar, and China, due to the increasing number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB while in Japan, primarily from these six countries. The new rule mandates that citizens from the Philippines and Nepal provide evidence of being TB-free before entering Japan, or they will be denied entry. While TB is curable, it remains a significant global health concern, having killed an estimated 1.25 million people in 2023. </p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, which includes measures to lower energy costs for over 7,000 businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms, while energy-intensive firms will see increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also focuses on upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending, with emphasis on sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies. While some business sectors welcome the move, others such as retail and leisure are unhappy with the proposed plans.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. engages in military action against Iran's nuclear sites, China's support for Tehran remains firm but restrained, influenced by its limited role as a peace broker and potential economic benefits from Middle East instability. China has drawn closer to Iran in recent years, cooperating on military exercises and signing a 25-year strategic partnership, primarily driven by access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz. Despite initial support for Iran, Beijing's rhetoric has shifted towards brokering dialogue and a ceasefire, avoiding direct condemnation of Israel while seeking to contain regional tensions to protect its economic and strategic interests. Some analysts suggest that a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could benefit China by destabilizing the U.S. and Europe, as China is better prepared to absorb the economic impact.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel will continue the conflict until its objectives of degrading Iran's missiles and nuclear program are achieved. Iran is considering its response to the U.S. attack, with potential options including cyber attacks and disrupting oil shipping in the Gulf. The situation places Iran in a difficult position, as a lack of response could be perceived as weakness, while retaliation could invite further U.S. action.</p>

It also aims to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, preventing a tax increase for American families and small businesses, and includes reforms to government spending on programs like Medicaid.

Legal scholars and watchdog groups contend that the Trump administration is relying on controversial statutes and stretching their interpretation to justify his agenda, leading to legal challenges and rebuffs in the courts. Experts warn that Trump's actions undermine the Constitution and erode Congress's authority, posing a threat to civic society and political norms.

          <p>Advocates are criticizing Senate Republicans' proposal to cut billions from Medicaid, arguing that it would disproportionately harm low-income and disabled individuals to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. The proposed cuts would exacerbate the impact of the House-passed bill, potentially leaving millions without health insurance and punishing states that expanded Medicaid. Critics argue that the cuts target the most cost-efficient healthcare program while ignoring inefficiencies in other parts of the system. Republicans claim the bill protects Medicaid by removing ineligible individuals and adding work requirements, but experts contend that these measures will create impossible situations for states and cause eligible individuals to lose coverage.</p>

          <p>Two butcher shops in northern France have been temporarily closed after a child died from severe food poisoning, with seven other children also sickened. Five of the children contracted hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare foodborne illness often caused by E.coli, which led to the death of a 12-year-old girl. While it's not confirmed that the meat products are the source, the children consumed meat from these shops before symptoms appeared. Authorities have launched an investigation to determine the source of the contamination.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has proposed allowing non-domiciled residents in the UK to avoid many UK taxes by paying a Â£250,000 fee, with the proceeds directed to low-income individuals. Under the plan, non-doms would receive a "Britannia Card" exempting them from taxes on wealth, income, and capital gains earned abroad, as well as inheritance tax. Reform UK estimates this policy would raise between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.5bn annually, equating to Â£600 - Â£1,000 per low-paid worker. Labour has criticized the measure as a tax cut for foreign billionaires that would necessitate raising taxes or cutting public services.</p>

Closing the strait could alienate neighboring oil-producing countries and provoke key trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. While the closure could lead to higher energy prices, it also risks inviting a strong response from the U.S. and Israel, potentially targeting Iran's oil production and export infrastructure.

Blocking it would have profound consequences for the global economy, disrupting international trade and ratcheting up oil prices.

          <p>The Los Angeles Board of Education is set to vote on an $18.8-billion budget for the upcoming school year, which officials say will stave off cuts and layoffs for one more year. Union leaders and activists are pushing for higher wages and increased spending on programs for Black students and immigrants, arguing that the district's reserves can support these initiatives. The budget proposes spending about $400 million more than the previous year but $200 million less than the year before, with officials warning of future cuts needed to avoid financial instability.</p>
