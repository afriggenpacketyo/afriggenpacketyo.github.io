          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled and require direct engagement between President Trump and President Xi Jinping to progress. Despite a breakthrough agreement in Switzerland on May 12, where both countries agreed to roll back recent tariff increases for 90 days, disagreements persist regarding tech restrictions on Beijing and China's restrictions on rare earths. Bessent expressed confidence that China would return to the table once President Trump communicates his preferences, highlighting the good relationship between the two leaders. Analysts suggest China will only agree to a call if there is certainty of no surprises from the U.S. during the conversation. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite his distinguished career, Kerik faced controversy, pleading guilty to federal charges in 2009 and serving three years in prison, though he was later pardoned by President Trump in 2020. Kerik oversaw the police response to the deadliest terrorist attack in US history, and was later appointed by former US President George Bush as head of a provisional police force in Iraq.</p>

The dismissal comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to demonstrate its support for the crypto industry, with the Justice Department having shut down its crypto enforcement team. Binance has also formed ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aiming to be a crypto bank, and Zhao has been appointed as an advisor to Pakistan's Crypto Council. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly attempting a "reverse Nixon" strategy, aiming to draw Russia closer to the United States to gain an advantage in geopolitical competition with China. This strategy involves seeking rapprochement with Russia, potentially isolating China and solidifying American global primacy. However, this approach carries risks, including the possibility of fracturing the American alliance with Europe without successfully splitting Russia from China. Experts suggest that the strong political, economic, and strategic interests shared by Putin and Xi, including mutual distrust of Washington, could make it difficult for Trump to drive a wedge between them.</p>

Her paintings often feature fragmented and depersonalized images of women's bodies, such as torsos in corsets and intricately arranged hairstyles. Ramberg's work emerged during a period of contradictions, as second-wave feminism coincided with cultural debates about sexual liberation. Her paintings blend elements of advertisements, comic panels, and voyeuristic photography, exploring themes of control, desire, and the constructed nature of identity.</p>

          <p>The FBI and the Trump administration are investigating an impersonation scheme involving White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. An unknown individual, pretending to be Wiles, has been contacting Republican senators, governors, and business executives. The impersonator, potentially using AI to mimic Wiles' voice, has made requests ranging from compiling pardon lists to transferring cash, raising concerns about the motive behind the scheme. Wiles' phone and email were reportedly hacked, potentially providing the impersonator with access to her contacts and information.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that premium video services, particularly live sports, are being pirated at an "industrial scale," enabled by a lack of action from big tech firms. Enders Analysis accuses companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of "ambivalence and inertia" regarding the issue, which costs broadcasters revenue and exposes users to cyber-crime risks. The report identifies the Amazon Fire Stick as a major enabler of piracy, allowing access to illegal streams alongside legitimate services. The report emphasizes that fans who watch pirated football matches risk providing sensitive information, such as credit card details and email addresses, making them vulnerable to malware and phishing scams.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, valued at $300 billion, is grappling with its corporate structure as it balances its initial nonprofit mission with the demands of a rapidly growing business. The company's original commitment to "safe" and "beneficial" AI, unconstrained by financial pressures, has been challenged by the success of ChatGPT and the competitive AI landscape. While OpenAI initially proposed transitioning to a for-profit model, concerns from various stakeholders, including Elon Musk and state attorneys general, led to a revised plan where the nonprofit remains in control. The debate centers on how to ensure responsible development and oversight of potentially catastrophic AI technology.</p>

The full fiscal year saw a 6.5% expansion, aligning with government estimates. The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports, which have helped cushion the impact of U.S. trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
