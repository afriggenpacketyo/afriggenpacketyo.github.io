          <p>A report by the Tech Transparency Project claims Meta has leveraged its sponsorship of the National PTA to promote its child safety initiatives, potentially influencing public perception. The report suggests Meta's tactics aim to counter concerns about platforms like Instagram harming teens, without always disclosing financial ties. This comes amid increasing criticism from parents, including one whose son died by suicide after a sextortion scheme on Meta's Messenger app. The National PTA defends its collaboration as a way to inform families about safety tools.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage unveiled a five-year plan, "Operation Restoring Justice," to tackle illegal migration by detaining and deporting all migrants arriving without permission. The plan includes offering £2bn to countries like Afghanistan for return deals, barring asylum claims for small boat arrivals, and potentially leaving the ECHR. The party aims to scale up deportations and build new removal centers, despite anticipated legal challenges and political opposition. This strategy seeks to eliminate incentives for illegal crossings.</p>

Despite mixed reactions from others, including fellow player Frances Tiafoe who called it "terrible," Alcaraz is laughing off the comments. The world No. 2, known for his fast-growing hair, expects his look to change again within days. This lighthearted incident provided a humorous start to his tournament.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for delaying negotiations with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, urging increased international pressure. This follows claims by Donald Trump that he arranged a ceasefire meeting. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with EU and Ukrainian counterparts to plan security guarantees for Kyiv. Merz stated that if Russia doesn't take steps towards peace, the West, including the EU and US, will need to exert more pressure, with new sanctions potentially on the horizon.</p>

This case, described as Kafkaesque, exposes the administration's alleged cruelty, randomness, and a willingness to defy court orders.

          <p>A double Israeli strike on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed 20 people, including five journalists and health workers. An initial strike was followed minutes later by a second, targeting rescuers and reporters who had arrived at the scene. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "tragic mishap" and promised an investigation, but the "double-tap" nature of the attack suggests intentionality. This incident has drawn strong international condemnation and renewed accusations of Israel intentionally targeting journalists, raising serious concerns about international law and civilian protection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Prime Minister François Bayrou's minority government faces potential collapse after opposition parties refused to support his September 8 confidence vote on deep budget cuts. Bayrou warned France is in "danger" from chronic over-indebtedness, proposing €44bn in fiscal tightening, including freezing welfare and pension spending. The CAC 40 index fell, and borrowing costs rose, reflecting market uncertainty. With no party officially backing him, Bayrou's chances of survival are low, potentially leading to a new prime minister or snap elections, further destabilizing French politics.

Eight others were also caned for adultery and gambling. The men were arrested after being seen entering a public park bathroom together, having connected via an online dating app. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, condemn the public caning as "state-sanctioned discrimination and cruelty" and a violation of human rights.</p>

          <p>Scotland's birth rate has fallen to its lowest recorded level since 1855, with only 45,763 live births registered last year. The total fertility rate decreased to 1.25, significantly below the 2.1 needed for population replacement without migration. This trend reflects long-term demographic changes, including a widening gap between deaths and births, and a shift towards women giving birth later in life. Major cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow exhibit the lowest fertility rates. These figures highlight ongoing demographic challenges for the nation.</p>

          <p>China under Xi Jinping is experiencing a "neo-totalitarian" shift, with the Communist Party intensifying control over all aspects of public life, from cultural trends to personal beliefs. The state actively dampens enthusiasm for popular culture, suppresses inconvenient truths, and intrudes more into daily life, creating a surreal environment detached from reality. This reassertion of control, driven by fears of losing ideological grip and economic challenges, risks curtailing China's vitality. Experts compare the current trajectory to the late Soviet period, raising concerns about systemic sclerosis and the country's long-term global ascent.</p>

While parents enjoy the decorating, experts warn that excessive interference can hinder young adults' autonomy, self-expression, and confidence. This shift also creates disparities, making move-in more complicated for students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Evolutionary biologist Toby Kiers' research explores how plants and fungi engage in complex resource trading, acting as "canny economic actors" without a central nervous system. Her work demonstrates that mycorrhizae fungi exchange phosphorus and nitrogen for plant sugars, employing strategies like "partner choice" to prevent freeloading. These underground networks, responsible for significant CO2 reduction and the Earth's atmosphere, exhibit sophisticated responses to supply and demand. Kiers suggests that understanding this decentralized decision-making in nature could offer insights for human supply chains and even artificial intelligence.</p>
