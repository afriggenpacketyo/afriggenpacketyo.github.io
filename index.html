          <h2>Police Chiefs to Gain Power to Remove Unfit Officers Following Everard Murder</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 22:28:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government measures will empower police chiefs to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, a reform driven by the Sarah Everard murder case. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper deems the changes "essential" for restoring public confidence in policing. The new rules, set to take effect next month, legally require all officers to pass vetting checks, addressing situations where officers failing checks remain on full pay. The move aims to prevent unfair dismissal processes, as seen in a recent High Court ruling regarding an officer accused of sexual assault, and ensure only officers meeting the highest standards wear the uniform.</p>

          <p>President Trump clarified that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously intensifying criticism and calling him "a major loser." Trump expressed his desire for Powell to be "a little more active" in cutting interest rates. This statement follows concerns raised by the National Economic Council Director about the possibility of Powell's dismissal, which had triggered market volatility. Trump also voiced optimism about improving trade relations with China, indicating potential tariff reductions if a deal is reached. The markets reacted positively to Trump's remarks, with major stock indexes showing gains.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has led to mandatory evacuations in several townships, with over 3,000 acres burning and 1,320 structures threatened. The fire, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, is currently 5% contained, and its cause remains under investigation. Multiple roads have been closed, and power outages have affected over 25,000 customers, though power has been restored to many. Shelters have been opened by the Red Cross to accommodate evacuees, and officials are urging people not to fly drones in the fire zones to ensure the safety of firefighting operations.</p>

          <p>Tesla is cautiously planning its entry into the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, due to significant tariff barriers. The company recognizes India's potential with its large middle class but acknowledges the challenges posed by high import tariffs and luxury taxes on EVs, which could double the price of Tesla vehicles. Tesla is working to determine the optimal timing for entry, considering India's protectionist policies and the need for local manufacturing. This comes after discussions between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding potential collaboration on technology and innovation.</p>

Voters are considering which party should govern amid an ongoing trade war with the U.S. and President Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. Latest polls suggest the Liberals have a slight lead over the Conservatives, with trade relations with the U.S. being a key campaign issue.</p>

          <p>Chinese energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term LNG contracts with US providers due to the ongoing US-China trade war, according to S&P Global analysts. Trade flows of US LNG to China have ceased since February due to retaliatory tariffs, which have now reached at least 140%. Chinese buyers hold 21 long-term procurement contracts with US producers, covering 25.6 million tonnes of annual volume. In the short term, the majority of the 5.7 million tonnes expected to be delivered this year to Chinese clients could be resold to other markets.</p>

          <p>China is urged to increase punishment for academic misconduct, which is seen as a significant threat to the nation's innovation push, according to an opinion piece in the People's Daily.

The article argues that only significantly increasing punishment can effectively deter academic dishonesty.

          <p>Campaigners argue that Instagram still poses serious risks to children, even with the introduction of Teen Accounts intended to provide more protection. Research indicates that users can create accounts using fake birthdays and are subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations to follow adult accounts. The 5Rights Foundation released the report as Ofcom prepares to publish its children's safety codes under the Online Safety Act. Meta maintains that its new accounts have built-in protections and that it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online.

          <p>In his final moments, Pope Francis expressed gratitude to his personal nurse for encouraging him to greet the crowds in St Peter's Square on Easter Sunday. The Vatican reported that these were among his last words before passing away from a stroke and heart failure. The pontiff, despite appearing exhausted, insisted on participating in the Easter celebrations, waving to the crowd and blessing babies. His funeral is scheduled for Saturday at St. Peter's Basilica, with plans for a conclave to elect his successor in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports that China has urged Japan to coordinate action against President Trump's tariff policies, as trade tensions escalate between the two largest economies. China sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba proposing coordinated action against US tariffs. The Japanese government is also considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington. In addition, a cross-party group of Japanese lawmakers visited the war-linked Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, drawing attention from Asian neighbors.</p>

          <p>Tesla's profits have plunged 71%, leading CEO Elon Musk to announce he will reduce his involvement with the "department of government efficiency" (DOGE). Tesla's net income and revenue from car sales have declined significantly, prompting concerns from investors and analysts. Musk attributed the blowback against his DOGE work to those who were receiving wasteful and fraudulent dollars, while dismissing protests against Tesla as being paid for. Musk maintained that Tesla's long-term profitability relies on robotaxis and autonomous robots, not conventional car sales, and stated that he will continue to spend some time on government matters.</p>

This move has alarmed conservation groups, who fear it could lead to the dismantling of national parks and public lands. Tyler Hassen, the DOGE member, has been given sweeping authority to consolidate and optimize administrative functions within the department. Conservation groups criticize the move, arguing that it places unelected DOGE officials in charge of national parks without relevant experience.

The cemetery primarily contains the remains of women, buried in unusual positions with unexpected artifacts.

Further analysis reveals that the individuals buried in the cemetery came from various parts of Wales and possibly southwestern England, with a diet based on carbs and lacking fish.</p>
