          <p>The UK and US have unveiled a landmark agreement to accelerate nuclear power development, aiming to generate thousands of jobs and significantly bolster Britain's energy security. Expected to be signed during President Trump's state visit, this deal is projected to unlock billions in private investment, including a proposal from X-Energy and Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, potentially powering 1.5 million homes. The broader program could be worth £40bn, with £12bn focused in the north-east of England, and also includes collaboration on fusion energy and ending reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed this as building a "golden age of nuclear" at the forefront of global innovation.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants, despite falling to 0-2 after a thrilling overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, demonstrated a significant improvement in performance and watchability compared to their season opener. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a sensational game with 450 passing yards and three touchdowns, forging a strong connection with Malik Nabers, though persistent penalties hindered the team. Meanwhile, Daniel Jones has led the Indianapolis Colts to a 2-0 start, and the Los Angeles Rams are also undefeated. The Cincinnati Bengals face uncertainty with a toe injury to Joe Burrow, while the Kansas City Chiefs are surprisingly 0-2, and the Pittsburgh Steelers suffered a catastrophic kickoff return error.</p>

          <p>North Korean officials formally declared the country's nuclear weapons status "irreversible," asserting it is permanently enshrined in state law and rejecting any interference from the International Atomic Energy Agency as an internal affair. This defiant statement coincided with the launch of "Freedom Edge 25," a joint military exercise involving the United States, South Korea, and Japan off South Korea's Jeju Island, scheduled to run through September 19. Pyongyang's Vice-Chairman Pak Jong Chon criticized these drills as a "grave challenge" to its security and a danger to regional stability, accusing the US of hypocrisy regarding nuclear proliferation while enhancing its own nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Fourteen NHS trusts in England are set to undergo investigations as part of a rapid review into systemic maternity care failures, a move announced by Health Secretary Wes Streeting following persistent issues and calls from bereaved families. The review, chaired by Baroness Amos, aims to address problems spanning over 15 years, including a failure to learn from safety incidents and poor outcomes for Black and Asian families. While some families, like the Maternity Safety Alliance, criticize the review as "not fit for purpose" for excluding NHS regulators, others view it as an important initial step. The article highlights the ongoing crisis, with over 800 preventable baby deaths in 2022-23 and concerns over "toxic" cultures within the NHS.</p>

A draft resolution condemns Israel's "hostile acts" and allegations of "genocide, ethnic cleansing, [and] starvation," which Israel strongly denies. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani urged the international community to cease applying "double standards" and punish Israel. US President Donald Trump commented on the need for caution in attacking people, while the UN Security Council previously condemned the strike. Qatar has been a key mediator in indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt confirmed that "technical discussions" are underway with Taliban representatives in Qatar to facilitate "regular" deportations of Afghan nationals convicted of crimes from Germany. This controversial policy, which has drawn strong criticism from the Green Party for engaging with an unrecognized Islamist organization, aligns with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's vow to deport individuals to Afghanistan and Syria. The announcement follows municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia where the conservative CDU emerged strongest, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) made significant gains, underscoring migration as a central and divisive topic in German politics.</p>

          <p>Data from the People's Bank of China indicates a sustained and robust shift of household savings into mainland China's US$12.7 trillion stock market, suggesting the current rally has considerable room to run. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions rose by 1.17 trillion yuan in August, marking a second consecutive month of significant increases. The article attributes this trend to low-interest-rate policies that are squeezing returns from traditional banking deposits, prompting capital to seek better returns in the capital market. The earnings yield of China’s biggest listed companies is now 5.5%, significantly higher than government bonds or demand deposit interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has passed Senate Bill 627, known as the "No Secret Police Act," which bans most local and federal law enforcement officers, including immigration enforcement agents, from covering their faces during operations. Introduced by Democratic state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, the bill aims to significantly boost transparency and public trust, having been inspired by concerns over heightened immigration operations. While law enforcement associations oppose the bill, citing officer safety and operational realities, supporters argue it will prevent impersonation and enhance accountability, with limited exemptions provided for specialized units like SWAT teams, undercover assignments, and medical masks.</p>
