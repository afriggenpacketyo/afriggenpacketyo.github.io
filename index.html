          <p>A private survey indicates that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly shrank in May, marking its worst drop since September 2022. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 48.3, signaling contraction for the first time since last year, as new export orders declined to their lowest level since July 2023. This contraction reflects the impact of U.S. tariffs and increasing uncertainty in the external trade environment, with the job market also remaining grim as employment shrank for the second consecutive month. Major macroeconomic indicators showed a marked weakening at the start of the second quarter, adding to domestic economic headwinds. Optimism is tempered by the economic realities of the moment.</p>

          <p>The acting head of FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, causing confusion and concern among agency staff. While a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the comment was a joke, current and former employees expressed that it offended agency staff already suffering from low morale. NOAA has predicted an above-average hurricane season with 13 to 19 named storms, highlighting the importance of FEMA's preparedness and response efforts. The agency maintains that it is focused on disaster response and protecting the American people despite the reported comment.</p>

He emphasized that these operations, though not military, carry a military message, placing immense pressure on Taiwan. Formal talks between Beijing and Taipei have been suspended since 2016, further complicating the situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to support the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a massive tax bill passed by the House, aiming to secure a legislative victory. The White House is mounting an "all-out advocacy effort" with administration officials pressuring senators to agree to the bill's broad contours. Sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, with Trump assuring no Medicaid benefit cuts will occur. The Senate must also comply with the Byrd rule, requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction, potentially necessitating changes that the House may need to accept.</p>

Trump claims it will also protect children by stopping funding for gender-affirming care for minors and prevent cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid.

          <p>One of Big Bear's eaglets, Sunny, has taken its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed bald eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow. The eaglet was seen perched on a branch before jumping off and flying away, while her sister, Gizmo, remained in the nest. Experts say the eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, eventually venturing out on their own by fall. The event has been highly anticipated by viewers of the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam, who have been watching the eaglets prepare for flight.</p>

          <p>A former assistant to Sean "Diddy" Combs, identified as "Mia," concluded her testimony in Combs' sex trafficking trial, facing intense cross-examination from defense attorneys. Mia testified that Combs tormented and sexually assaulted her, while defense attorneys challenged her credibility with text messages and social media posts expressing love and admiration for Combs. Prosecutors sought to minimize any damage to her credibility by highlighting that she didn't document abuse, but did post positive things as part of her job. The prosecution also called a hotel manager to testify about damage to Combs' hotel room, linking it to previous testimony about alleged orgies.</p>

Their attorneys argued that the prosecution was unjust, as the men believed they were freeing the sharks from an illegal fishing line.
