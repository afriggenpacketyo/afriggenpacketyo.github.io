          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, is returning to the U.S. to face criminal charges. He is indicted in Tennessee on charges of conspiracy and unlawful transportation of undocumented migrants for financial gain. His lawyer argues that bringing him back to prosecute him after the error demonstrates an abuse of power and a denial of due process, emphasizing the case's significance in the ongoing debate over deportation procedures.

          <p>Initial claims for U.S. unemployment benefits have risen to their highest level in eight months, reaching 247,000, which suggests a possible slowdown in the labor market. This increase exceeded economists' predictions, and it comes amid growing concerns over tariffs impacting U.S. businesses and consumers. While overall unemployment claims remain historically low, the recent uptick is considered noteworthy, potentially indicating broader workforce shifts.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant previously deported to his home country due to an admitted administrative error, has been indicted on federal criminal charges in the U.S. The indictment, filed in Nashville, includes one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Abrego Garcia's initial deportation sparked controversy, as he had been granted legal status in 2019 that forbade his removal to El Salvador due to the risk of persecution by local gangs. He was among those sent to El Salvador's maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center as part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.</p>

          <h2>Why Trump May Find It Difficult to Sever Ties with Musk</h2>

          <p>Despite their recent public spat, President Trump may find it challenging to cut ties with Elon Musk due to SpaceX's dominance in space launches and its importance to U.S. space-based projects. SpaceX is crucial for U.S. military and intelligence operations, as well as NASA's programs like Artemis. Canceling contracts with Musk's companies could disrupt these critical missions. Trump's ambitious plans, such as the Golden Dome missile defense project, also rely on SpaceX's capabilities.</p>

          <p>An economist warns that despite seemingly stable U.S. job market reports, there are "cracks in the foundation" that could negatively impact workers. The economy has seen a decrease in the average number of new jobs added monthly. Much of the available positions are concentrated in sectors like health care, leisure, and hospitality, but these sectors face potential limitations due to tariffs and healthcare policies in the Trump administration's "Big, Beautiful Bill." Proposed Medicaid spending cuts could particularly affect the healthcare industry's job growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The girls died from apparent suffocation in a remote campground in Washington state. Decker is considered to "pose a significant risk, if approached." He is believed to have military training in mountain survival, making the search difficult. The US Marshals Service has announced a $20,000 reward for information leading to Decker's capture.</p>

          <p>International stocks are outperforming U.S. stocks so far in 2025, with the MSCI ACWI ex-USA index returning 15.7% compared to the S&P 500's 1.5%. This shift is driven by concerns over market volatility in the U.S. and relatively weaker performance compared to global counterparts. Experts suggest diversifying portfolios with foreign stocks for long-term gains. Adding international stocks can help investors tap into different economic cycles and mitigate U.S.-specific risks.

          <p>President Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is facing strong opposition in the Senate, coinciding with escalating attacks from Elon Musk. Senators across the Republican spectrum have expressed concerns about the bill's spending and potential consequences for healthcare. Musk has criticized the bill as an "abomination" that would increase the national debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could add trillions to deficits and cause millions to lose health insurance.</p>

          <h2>'Dangerous Animals' Review: A Shark Horror Film With Tired Blood</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 13:52:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean Byrne's "Dangerous Animals" draws from serial-killer thrillers and shark survival stories, but lacks the narrative wrinkles and thematic depth of his previous work. The movie stars Hassie Harrison as a surfer kidnapped by a boat captain, played by Jai Courtney, who films his victims being devoured by sharks. The film doesn't live up to its potential, surrendering to genre expectations rather than transcending them. It's a disappointing horror movie with underdeveloped ideas.</p>
