        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a ruling that addresses presidential power, the Supreme Court suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection against being fired by a president, while allowing President Trump to remove two members of other federal agencies' boards. The court's decision emphasized the unique structure of the Federal Reserve. Justice Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority's ruling created an unnecessary exemption for the Federal Reserve, potentially undermining the independence of other administrative bodies. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that he would not resign if asked by President Trump, asserting that the president lacks the authority to remove him. </p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security criticized a judge for halting the deportation of Nyo Myint, an illegal immigrant convicted of attempted first-degree sexual assault against a disabled woman. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin condemned the judge's decision, emphasizing the severity of Myint's crime and its impact on the victim. The White House echoed these sentiments, labeling the ruling as an attempt by a far-left activist judge to undermine President Trump's immigration policies. Trump himself criticized the judge and called for the Supreme Court to intervene and end the trend of judges inhibiting his administrationâ€™s deportation agenda. </p>

          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The provision, tucked into a tax and spending cut bill, aims to curb the power of federal courts to issue injunctions blocking Trump's executive actions. Democrats argue that the measure would undermine the judiciary by removing any consequences for officials who disregard judges' rulings. The provision would apply retroactively, affecting ongoing cases where federal judges are considering holding Trump administration officials in contempt. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has dashed hopes of saving Voice of America from dismantlement by the Trump administration, which has already iced most of the workforce. The administration, led by senior advisor Kari Lake, has laid off hundreds of contract employees and put permanent workers on indefinite leave. Under Lake's guidance, the agency has canceled contracts with major news services and struck a deal to carry coverage from a far-right network. The workforce has been whipsawed between court rulings, with plaintiffs claiming the administration has violated Congressional statutes and Constitutional protections of free speech. </p>

          <p>Joe Kent, President Trump's nominee to head the National Counterterrorism Center, is facing scrutiny over emails showing he pressed intelligence analysts to amend an assessment of links between the Venezuelan government and the criminal gang, Tren de Aragua. Kent's actions aimed to align the assessment more closely with Trump administration policies and criticize Biden-era immigration programs. Critics argue that Kent's attempts to influence the assessment politicized national security. Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees have called for a pause in considering Kent's nomination. </p>
