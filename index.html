          <h2>Ancient Chinese Star Catalogue May Be Oldest in the World</h2>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists propose that "Shi's Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years. Published in the journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics, the study cites new evidence suggesting the catalogue was created around 335BC, predating the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece. The researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming observation years in the catalogue's main content, followed by revisions around AD125. This research suggests that detailed astronomical studies began in China and Greece around the same time, challenging the previously held belief that the Greek catalogue was the oldest.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has proposed imposing 100% tariffs on films produced outside the United States, citing a "National Security threat" due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers. The Australian government responded, vowing to defend its screen industry, which heavily relies on foreign productions attracted by a 30% rebate for big-budget projects. Industry stakeholders express uncertainty about the practical implications of the tariffs, particularly regarding the potential impact on the export of Australian content to the U.S. market. The proposal could significantly disrupt the global film industry, potentially making movie tickets more expensive and affecting the viability of international productions.</p>

They are pushing for enhanced cooperation among law enforcement agencies to address thousands of open FBI cases related to missing persons and homicides. Many Indigenous women are covering their mouths with red handprints, symbolizing those who have been silenced, while parents are educating their children about the risks they face. Advocacy groups are hosting self-defense training and showing documentaries to raise awareness about unresolved cases and the disproportionate rates of violence experienced by Indigenous women.</p>

          <p>British police are questioning five men, including four Iranian nationals, in connection with an alleged terror plot targeting a specific location in the UK.

Authorities stress that the two investigations are not linked, but the scale of activity is considered significant. MI5 has reported responding to 20 Iran-backed plots since January 2022, highlighting potential lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate skeptical of the EU and against military support for Ukraine, secured a leading position in the first round of the Romanian presidential election. This election is a rerun after the previous result was annulled due to campaign fraud allegations. Simion, an admirer of Donald Trump, will face the liberal mayor of Bucharest in the runoff. His stance on foreign policy and support for a strong NATO are causing concern in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance as a transit route for weapons to Ukraine and its hosting of a US missile defense shield.</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a more assertive stance, shaping the country's tone with tough rhetoric. He emphasized that any military misadventure by India would face a swift and resolute response. Analysts attribute this to Munir's need to project strength amid Pakistan's political divisions and economic hardships, coupled with his hard-line views on India rooted in his intelligence background and belief in a religious conflict. Munir's recent remarks, framing Kashmir as Pakistan's "jugular vein" and invoking the "two-nation theory," have been interpreted as a significant shift in Pakistan's stance toward India, raising concerns about potential escalation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado and the city of Denver, alleging interference with federal immigration enforcement through the implementation of "sanctuary laws." The lawsuit claims that these policies violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by hindering cooperation with federal officials in enforcing immigration laws. The Justice Department argues that Colorado's policies allowed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to operate in the Denver suburb of Aurora. Colorado officials maintain that the state is not a sanctuary and regularly collaborates with law enforcement agencies.</p>

The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs using Chinese-made turboprop aircraft. The suspension is attributed to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed railway networks increasingly replace air travel within Shaanxi province.

The maximum security facility, also known as The Rock, was closed in 1963 and currently operates as a tourist site.

          <h2>Roses Were Likely Originally Yellow, Study Suggests</h2>

          <p>A new genomic study by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, contrary to the popular association of roses with red. The study, published in Nature Plants, analyzed domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are among the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers, known for their variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, but the ancestral traits suggest a different origin than the multilayered, pink and red roses commonly seen today.</p>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in various technologies, especially in artificial intelligence, and has developed a real edge in commercializing and manufacturing tech. They note that Chinese AI models are nearly on par with U.S. versions, with some even surpassing them in certain benchmarks. They suggest the U.S. needs to openly share more of its AI technologies, innovate faster, and double down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge. This perspective challenges the belief that America is always ahead and calls for a strategic response to China's growing technological prowess.</p>

          <p>Three Bulgarians, later convicted of spying for Russia, attended an event in the UK Parliament in May 2016, according to a BBC News investigation. Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzhambazov, and Katrin Ivanova were present at a Brexit debate in a committee room, with photographs showing them alongside representatives of European political parties. The spies, who conducted surveillance operations across Europe targeting enemies of Vladimir Putin's regime, were directed from Russia by Jan Marsalek, an asset of Russian intelligence services. The event was sponsored by a former MP, now Baroness Brown of Silvertown, who claims no memory of the event and denies meeting the individuals.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was primarily attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in 2022 and 2023 when many development projects resumed after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>
