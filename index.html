          <p>A memorial service was held for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month. The event, attended by tens of thousands at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, featured speakers including former President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, delivered a powerful speech in which she stated her forgiveness for the alleged shooter, emphasizing that love is the answer to hate. Kirk, 31, was the influential founder of Turning Point USA and a prominent voice in conservative politics, particularly among young people.</p>

          <p>Researchers on Nantucket are pioneering a new method to fight Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population. The project, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, aims to make the mice, which are the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria, immune to the disease. By introducing Lyme-immune mice into the wild, scientists hope to break the transmission cycle where ticks become infected after biting mice. This novel approach of "heritable immunization" is being developed with community input to ensure ecological safety and public support before any potential release.</p>

Founded by figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat the self-censorship and lack of intellectual diversity they see on other campuses. Operating from a modest downtown Austin location, UATX currently offers free tuition, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations. The curriculum emphasizes Western civilization and seminar-style classes under a "Chatham House Rule" to encourage candid discussion.</p>

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes a remarkable 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico for the winter. These butterflies can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs by suppressing their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the arduous journey. Scientists are still studying the mysteries of their navigation, which involves internal compasses and circadian clocks. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this phenomenon, as the monarch population has declined significantly due to habitat loss, particularly the milkweed plants essential for their reproduction.</p>

          <p>Women's sports activist Riley Gaines praised Erika Kirk's speech at the memorial for her late husband, conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, calling it "the most powerful speech I've ever heard." Gaines highlighted the strength and compassion shown by Kirk, who publicly forgave her husband's alleged assassin just 11 days after his death. In her address to thousands of mourners, Kirk emphasized that her husband's mission was to help young men who feel lost and that the answer to hate is love. Gaines remarked on X that only God could provide the serenity and strength for such an act of forgiveness in the face of tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded their regular-season home schedule with a 3-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, despite a strong performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan. A late-inning bullpen collapse allowed the Giants to score three runs in the eighth inning, securing their victory. The game marked a historic milestone for the Dodgers, as they surpassed 4 million in home attendance for the first time, a franchise record. Despite the loss, the team is poised to enter the National League playoffs next week with a high probability of hosting postseason games.</p>

He argued that the UK government is miscalculating by believing it doesn't have to choose between the U.S. and the EU.

This shift is driven by the growing importance of sectors like AI and hardware, where deep technical expertise is valued more than traditional business credentials. Consequently, VC firms are now more frequently recruiting talent directly from tech companies like OpenAI and SpaceX, rather than relying solely on elite business schools for new hires.

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The plan involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which would significantly increase flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 per year by the late 2030s. The government has touted the privately-financed expansion as a "no-brainer for growth," citing job creation and economic benefits. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate emissions from the additional air traffic.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mountain lion, known to researchers as F390, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in San Juan Capistrano. She was the mother of two 14-month-old cubs who were still dependent on her for learning crucial survival and hunting skills. Researchers with the UC Davis California Carnivores Program have since managed to place a GPS collar on the female cub to monitor her well-being. The incident highlights the significant threat that vehicle collisions pose to Southern California's mountain lion population, whose habitats are increasingly fragmented by roads and highways.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has rejected President Trump's recent call for the United States to retake control of Bagram Air Base. Trump had stated that talks were underway and warned of "BAD THINGS" if the base was not returned. In response, a Taliban spokesman cited the Doha Agreement, in which the U.S. pledged not to threaten Afghanistan's territorial integrity, and urged Washington to adopt a policy of "realism." The sprawling military facility, a key U.S. hub for nearly 20 years, fell into Taliban hands during the chaotic American withdrawal in 2021.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the moment the school's principal, James Marsh, had a surprise encounter with a black bear. As Marsh went to unlock a dumpster, the bear's head emerged from under the lid, startling him and causing him to run in one direction while the bear fled in the other. No one was harmed in the incident, which serves as a reminder of how unsecured trash can attract wildlife into urban areas. As natural habitats shrink, such encounters become more common, highlighting the need for proper waste management to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 federal funding deadline approaching, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is pressing President Donald Trump to negotiate a bipartisan deal to prevent a government shutdown. Schumer's call comes after the Senate rejected funding proposals from both parties, increasing the likelihood of a lapse in government services. Democrats have identified the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits as a key demand in the negotiations. Both parties appear to be positioning themselves to blame the other should a shutdown occur, creating a high-stakes political standoff. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Arsenal featured an uncharacteristically defensive tactical shift from manager Pep Guardiola, which nearly secured a victory. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, City ceded possession and adopted a deep, 5-5-0 formation in the second half, a move commentators compared to the style of José Mourinho. This strategy frustrated Arsenal until a 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli salvaged a point for the home side. The result is seen as a win for league leaders Liverpool, as both title contenders dropped crucial points in the tight race.</p>

Senator Chris Murphy stated the country is "quickly turning into a banana republic" by using federal power to punish political enemies.

The protests, supported by prominent artists and cultural figures, were sparked by legislative moves to fast-track the amnesty bill and shield lawmakers from prosecution. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to over 27 years in prison for his role in the January 2023 uprising and a plot to remain in power. The nationwide demonstrations reflect deep public division over the former president's conviction and the effort to pardon him.</p>

Damari accused Prime Minister Keir Starmer of living "under a two-state delusion" by making the declaration before Hamas is removed from power in Gaza.
