          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who alleged sexual abuse and trafficking, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at age 41. Her family stated she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and the toll became unbearable. Giuffre accused Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of grooming and sexually abusing her, and she filed a civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew, alleging sexual assault when she was 17, which was later settled out of court. Her lawyer and representative described her as a fierce warrior, a champion for other victims, and an extraordinary human being who will be deeply missed.</p>

          <p>Canada is heading to federal elections with a close contest expected between the ruling Liberals, led by recently appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney, and the opposition Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre. Carney, a former head of the Banks of Canada and England, is hailed for his financial expertise but lacks political experience. Poilievre, a long-time MP, advocates for low taxes and a smaller government, resonating with Canadians concerned about the housing crisis and cost of living. The Bloc Québécois, focused on Quebec's interests, and the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, also play key roles in the election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the United States is nearing a tariff agreement with Japan, as Ryosei Akazawa prepares for further negotiations in Washington.

          <p>Shedeur Sanders experienced further disappointment during the NFL Draft as he was prank-called by an imposter pretending to be a general manager, after falling to the third round despite projections of being a high pick. This incident added to the controversy surrounding his draft slide, with some speculating about underlying reasons for his delayed selection. President Trump weighed in, criticizing NFL owners for passing on Sanders, while others suggested racial bias may have played a role. Sanders himself remained optimistic, viewing the situation as "fuel to the fire."</p>

          <p>FBI agents arrested Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing immigration agents by helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest in her courtroom. This action marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's conflict with local authorities over immigration enforcement.

          <p>A Japanese research team has found that listening to a one-minute sound at 100 hertz can potentially prevent motion sickness symptoms. The sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing symptoms like lightheadedness and nausea. In experiments involving volunteers exposed to the sound before riding on a swing, driving simulator, and car, 70-80% experienced alleviated symptoms. Researchers believe the sound activates the vestibular system by stimulating the otolithic organs in the inner ear. They hope to implement the study's findings soon, offering an alternative to medication for motion sickness prevention.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office allegedly set up a system allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard Defense Department security protocols. A computer monitor in Hegseth's office provided remote access to Signal and text messages from his personal cellphone. This setup, not on the Defense Department's secure network, poses a security risk. Hegseth has faced criticism for sharing details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group that included individuals without a clear need to know.</p>

          <p>California is projected to exhaust its current license plate sequence by 2026, prompting the launch of a new sequence next year. The new format will consist of three numerals, followed by three letters, and one numeral (e.g., 000AAA0). The accelerated depletion of the current sequence is partly attributed to increased new car registrations, driven by fears of price hikes due to potential trade wars. The state's standard automobile license plates have a configuration of one number, followed by three letters, followed by three numbers.</p>
