          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated rice prices. The move will leave the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. The released rice will be sold to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers.

The Treasury said Sizewell C will create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" that would "kickstart" economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a "golden age of clean energy". The government insists that nuclear power provides enormous amounts of low-carbon, non-intermittent energy. </p>
