          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, causing significant delays and cancellations. The FAA confirmed the telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display for about 90 seconds, exacerbating existing travel disruptions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy highlighted the outdated equipment as a key issue, noting the need for system upgrades, which could take up to four years with congressional funding. United Airlines has limited flights due to the ongoing problems, with the CEO stating that the airport cannot handle the current flight schedule, leaving travelers and officials frustrated with the recurring disruptions.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has reached a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi over a lawsuit regarding the blood thinner Plavix. The settlement resolves claims that the companies failed to update labels despite knowing about a diminished response in about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians. While the companies did not admit wrongdoing, they agreed to the settlement, which will be divided equally between them and paid to the state by June 9. Governor Josh Green hailed the settlement as a major victory for Hawaii.</p>

          <p>A judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at 20 federal agencies, following a lawsuit from federal employee unions. The ruling prevents the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and other agencies from taking further steps to carry out an executive order mandating large-scale job cuts. Judge Susan Illston stated that the administration likely exceeded its legal authority and needs congressional approval for the changes. The order remains in effect for at least 14 days while the case is considered.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan indicates that 39% of people experience loneliness at times, with little change since the previous survey in 2023. The survey also examined the relationship between loneliness and smartphone usage, finding that those using smartphones for over eight hours a day were more likely to feel lonely. Bereavement of a family member was the most frequently cited factor contributing to loneliness. Japan's law to tackle loneliness and isolation, enacted in April 2024, has yet to show a significant impact.</p>

This settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion settlement with Meta over illegal facial tagging.

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intent to land on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been drifting in space for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the landing location is unknown. The spacecraft's protective heat shield increases the likelihood that it will survive the plunge, though the risk of injuries on the ground is low. The spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude, covering a vast area of the Earth.</p>
