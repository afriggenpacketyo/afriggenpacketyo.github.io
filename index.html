          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his position among cycling's elite. Despite having a significant lead and facing treacherous, rain-slicked roads, Pogačar launched a bold attack during the final stage in Paris, a move characteristic of his aggressive racing style. Although he didn't win the final stage, which went to Belgian Wout van Aert, he finished safely, securing the overall victory by a margin of 4 minutes and 24 seconds over two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard. The 26-year-old's victory marks his continued dominance in the sport, adding to his impressive record in major cycling tours.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be enshrined, has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, receiving 99.7% of the vote. He was joined by dominant pitcher CC Sabathia and formidable reliever Billy Wagner in the 2025 class. Suzuki, known for his incredible contact hitting and 10 All-Star appearances, joked about the single writer who left him off the ballot, preventing a unanimous selection. Sabathia, a Cy Young winner and World Series champion, reflected on his career and the pivotal decision to join the New York Yankees, a move he initially resisted but came to see as his destiny.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods, which is half of the previously threatened rate. The deal, announced after a meeting in Scotland between Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, aims to stabilize the €1.4 trillion transatlantic trade relationship. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in US energy products and investing $600 billion in the American economy. While the deal averts a trade war, some sectors like steel will still face high tariffs, and the new baseline rate is higher than pre-Trump levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK, citing growing concerns over imported pets. An investigation revealed that many dogs from countries like Romania and Ukraine are sold online with minimal vetting, leading to issues such as aggressive behavior and the spread of diseases like Brucella canis. This bacterium, which can be transmitted to humans, has seen a significant rise in cases. The article highlights stories of owners facing severe difficulties, including one whose dog had to be euthanized after an attack, underscoring the potential dangers of what one expert called a "Deliveroo for dogs" system.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in specific areas of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to reach starving populations. This move comes amid mounting international pressure and dire warnings of famine, with images of emaciated children sparking global outrage. The pauses are intended to create secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to distribute essential supplies like food and medicine. While aid organizations have welcomed the step, they emphasize that a full ceasefire is necessary to address the catastrophic humanitarian crisis affecting the entire Gaza Strip, where the death toll from malnutrition continues to rise.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to properly warn millions of people during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey. The system should have sent a high-level "Take Action" alert to 10 million people, providing up to 35 seconds of warning, but only 469 such alerts were dispatched for the initial 7.8 magnitude tremor. The system drastically underestimated the quake's strength, sending a less urgent "Be Aware" notification to about half a million users instead. Following the disaster, which killed over 55,000 people, Google adjusted its algorithms, which in simulations then generated the appropriate number of critical warnings.</p>

This includes the National Archive of Remembrance and groups like Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, which works to identify children stolen from political prisoners.

          <p>An investigative report reveals how a Skyvan PA-51 aircraft, used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," was discovered in the United States and returned as a historical witness. Journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo tracked down the plane and its flight logs, providing irrefutable evidence of its use to murder political prisoners by dropping them into the Atlantic Ocean. Their investigation was crucial in the 2017 conviction of 48 individuals for crimes against humanity, including the pilots of the death flights.

The victims, five men and six women ranging in age from 21 to 84, are all expected to survive. Authorities stated that the terrorism charge is justified because the mass attack was intended to instill fear in the entire community. The suspect was confronted by multiple citizens in the parking lot before being taken into custody by a responding deputy.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses China's complex political and economic landscape. Ang, an influential scholar on Chinese development, addresses the decline in American expertise on China, contrasting the current situation with the deep investment in understanding made by pioneers of US-China relations like her "grand teacher," Michel Oksenberg. She emphasizes the historical importance of building a community of expertise to inform policymakers and the public. The article positions Ang as a key voice in interpreting China's ability to adapt and navigate its challenges in an unpredictable global environment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area has a significant opportunity to establish itself as a premier destination for sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already investing in smart infrastructure and climate innovation, creating a foundation for a low-carbon travel corridor connecting its cities. The piece points to Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transport network as key first steps. To fully realize this potential, the author contends that the region must now build on this hardware with coordinated policies, partnerships, and experiences that cater to the growing demand for environmentally conscious travel.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with Donald Trump in Scotland to discuss transatlantic trade and the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The talks are expected to focus on refining the recently announced US-UK trade deal, with Starmer likely pressing for lower tariffs on key imports like steel. On Gaza, Starmer will navigate a delicate diplomatic position, balancing the UK's alignment with European allies who are increasingly critical of Israel, and the staunchly pro-Israel stance of the US administration. The meeting underscores the close ties Starmer has sought to build with Trump, even amid clear foreign policy differences.</p>

          <p>Small blue lights are being installed on top of traffic signals in several Florida counties to help law enforcement identify drivers who run red lights. These "confirmation lights" illuminate simultaneously with the red light, allowing an officer positioned at any angle to verify if a driver has entered the intersection illegally. The system is designed to improve safety for officers and act as a deterrent to dangerous driving behavior. Studies from other states where these lights have been implemented have shown statistically significant reductions in crashes caused by running red lights, a major cause of traffic fatalities.</p>
