          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, which will allow taxpayer money to fund private school tuition for qualifying students. Abbott hailed the bill as a victory for Texas families and school children, emphasizing that it ensures students have the freedom to seek the educational option best suited for them. Democrats, however, argue that the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already attending private institutions. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most private school students and up to $30,000 for students with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of PBS and NPR, Paula Kerger and Katherine Maher respectively, are pushing back against President Trump's executive order aimed at cutting federal funding to the two major public broadcasting systems. Kerger stated that this situation is unprecedented, with the administration attacking PBS on multiple fronts, including possible rescission of already appropriated funds and challenges to corporate sponsorships. Maher echoed concerns about the devastating impact on local stations, especially in rural communities where they serve as the sole source of local news. The article also notes that the administration claims that government funding for news media is "corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump has sought to greatly enlarge executive power, going beyond the unitary executive theory. The author argues that Trump's administration justifies his attraction to power by drawing on a longer tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical and dictatorial rule. The tradition begins with legal theorist Carl Schmitt and can be followed in the work of the political philosopher Leo Strauss, thinkers affiliated with the Claremont Institute, and the contemporary writings of the legal scholar Adrian Vermeule. The author warns that such an expansive view of executive power threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the recent boxing match between Saúl Álvarez (Canelo) and William Scull, which was criticized for being unentertaining. It questions whether Canelo's upcoming fight against Terence Crawford will be more exciting, considering Crawford's smaller size and the likelihood of an unequal match. While Crawford is a skilled boxer, he will have to move up two weight divisions to fight Canelo, making it a challenging and potentially uneven contest. Experts like Julio César Chávez predict Canelo will knock out Crawford, and Daniel Jacobs suggests Crawford may adjust his style to avoid a similar fate to Amir Khan, who faced Canelo in 2016.</p>

          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth stated that Mike Waltz will face a "brutal hearing" for his nomination as U.N. ambassador, citing his participation in a Signal chain that inadvertently included a journalist. Duckworth argues that Waltz is unqualified for the position and that everyone involved in the Signal chain should be held accountable. She also criticizes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, calling him "the most untrained, inadequate, Secretary of Defense in our nation's history."</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to "intensify and expand" its operations in Gaza. The IDF aims to return hostages held in Gaza and defeat Hamas militants, with plans to operate in new areas and "destroy all infrastructure" above and below ground. This decision follows failed international negotiations for a new ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages.
