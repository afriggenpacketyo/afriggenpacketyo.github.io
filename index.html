          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, has reportedly accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. The agreement, which would result in four consecutive life sentences, has caused a split among the victims' families. While the father of Madison Mogen expressed relief at avoiding a prolonged trial and appeals process, the family of Kaylee Goncalves stated they are "beyond furious" and were not properly consulted by prosecutors. A change of plea hearing is expected this week, though the deal remains subject to a judge's final approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump, alongside Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, visited a new, controversial immigration detention center dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" in the Florida Everglades. The facility, located at a remote airport, is intended to house, process, and deport undocumented immigrants. Proponents, including DeSantis, have praised its isolated and secure location, while critics and protesters have condemned the project as a "callous political stunt."

They express grave concerns that the shutdown, which terminated 83% of programs and 94% of staff, could worsen global crises like famine and disease, potentially increasing migration pressures on U.S. borders.

          <p>To determine if a company's culture is a good fit, job seekers should ask hiring managers, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" According to NYU professor and author Suzy Welch, this question cuts through generic corporate platitudes and elicits honest, revealing answers about a company's true values. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" or "someone who's too social" offer genuine insight into daily work life. Welch advises asking this disarming question late in the interview process, ideally after an offer is made, to best gauge alignment with personal values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a major spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. The ongoing uncertainty and frequent changes in trade policy have also made businesses hesitant to pass on costs immediately. However, experts caution that this buffering effect is likely temporary and expect prices to rise later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following recent U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, stated that he does not expect diplomatic talks with the U.S. to resume quickly. In an interview, Araghchi said Iran needs assurance that it will not face further military attacks during negotiations before it re-engages. While acknowledging the severe damage to its nuclear sites, he asserted that Iran could rapidly repair them and that its nuclear program is a matter of national pride. Despite the current tensions and skepticism about immediate talks, he insisted that the "doors of diplomacy will never slam shut."</p>

The missile defense sector showed the highest dependency, with an 11.1% share of suppliers from China.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced criminal charges in a widespread scheme where North Korea placed thousands of IT workers in unwitting American companies to fund its weapons programs. These workers allegedly used stolen or fake identities to secure remote employment, with their salaries being funneled to the North Korean government. The nationwide operation resulted in arrests and the seizure of financial accounts and websites used in the fraud.

          <p>The public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk has intensified, with Trump stating he would "take a look" at deporting the U.S. citizen. The conflict stems from Musk's harsh criticism of Trump's major spending bill, which Musk has called an "abomination." In response to a reporter's question, Trump also suggested that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a cost-cutting agency Musk once led, might be directed to investigate and cut the substantial federal subsidies received by Musk's companies. The exchange marks a dramatic escalation in the dispute between the former political allies.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab concludes that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would financially harm the lowest-earning Americans while significantly benefiting the wealthiest. The report projects that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9% ($700), while the top 20% would gain 2.2% ($5,700). This regressive outcome is attributed to sharp cuts in Medicaid and SNAP, which disproportionately affect lower-income families, combined with tax cuts that primarily favor wealthier households. The findings align with other analyses of the proposed legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The genre of literature exploring kink and BDSM has evolved from a niche category to a mainstream presence, reflecting broader societal shifts in accepting non-conventional sexual practices. This article reviews Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core," which delves into the world of a San Francisco sex worker, exploring themes of identity, loneliness, and the psychological complexities of the industry. The piece contrasts such fictional explorations, which retain a sense of fantasy and intrigue, with nonfiction works that often aim to demystify and normalize kink. It highlights how literature is mapping the complex terrain where transgressive desires meet the pursuit of legitimacy.</p>
