        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps has justified the decision to keep a major data breach secret, stating his primary focus was on saving lives. The breach exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who had worked with British forces, placing them at high risk of retaliation from the Taliban. Shapps argued that a super-injunction was necessary to prevent the compromised list from being publicized, which could have led to individuals being pursued and murdered. He asserted that faced with the same choice again, he would prioritize protecting lives over immediate transparency.</p>

          <p>Essex Police reported that officers were assaulted and vehicles were damaged during a volatile protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping. The demonstration, which involved hundreds of people, saw some protesters throwing eggs and setting off fireworks. The unrest follows heightened local tensions after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual offenses. Police have made two arrests and are analyzing footage to identify other individuals responsible for the violence and criminal damage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in previously approved government funding. The legislation, a victory for Republicans and President Trump, targets foreign aid programs like USAID and federal support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which includes NPR and PBS. Passed with a 216-213 vote, the bill now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law, with Republican leaders indicating it is the first of many planned spending cuts.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition. The diagnosis came after the president experienced swelling in his legs, prompting a medical examination. According to his physician, the condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart and is not considered serious. The doctor's memo also confirmed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or other serious illnesses, stating the president remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new $250 "visa integrity fee" for most visitors who require a non-immigrant visa to enter the country. This fee, part of the newly enacted "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," will be charged in addition to existing application fees. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with all visa conditions, the implementation details are unclear, and immigration experts are advising clients to treat the fee as non-refundable for planning purposes.</p>
