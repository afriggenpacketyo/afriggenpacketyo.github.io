          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders have signed an open letter urging venture firm Sequoia Capital to denounce partner Shaun Maguire's "inflammatory attack" against Muslim Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire, a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, posted on X that Mamdani "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and is advancing an "Islamist agenda." The letter demands Sequoia condemn these comments, apologize to Mamdani and Muslim founders, authorize an independent investigation into Maguire's past behavior, and establish a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech. Signatories, including CEOs and founders from companies like Careem and Vectara, threaten broader public disclosure if Sequoia does not respond by July 14.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 09:46:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Passengers at several U.S. airports, including Baltimore/Washington International and Fort Lauderdale International, are reportedly no longer required to remove their shoes during standard preflight security checks. This phased change, confirmed by sources familiar with the development and seemingly by the White House, marks a notable shift from the rule implemented nationwide in 2006 after the "shoe bomber" incident. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) stated it is continuously exploring new and innovative methods to enhance both the passenger experience and its robust security posture. While travelers with TSA PreCheck already benefited from this exemption, the new policy extends this convenience to a broader group, aiming to streamline the airport security process for a larger segment of the traveling public.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the devastating Southport attack, which resulted in the deaths of three children and injuries to ten others, has begun at Liverpool Town Hall. Chaired by Sir Adrian Fulford, the inquiry will examine how public bodies handled the "deteriorating and deeply troubling behavior" of perpetrator Axel Rudakubana, exploring missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy. Disturbing details, including Rudakubana's past violence and online research into terrorist atrocities, were heard. The inquiry aims to deliver "sensible and achievable" recommendations, focusing on interventions for young people drawn into extreme violence and the balance between civil liberties and public protection.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, days after pausing some shipments. Speaking during a White House event, Trump stated that Ukraine "has to be able to defend themselves" and is "getting hit very hard." This decision follows his recent calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with Trump expressing disappointment with the Putin call. The move comes amid a broader review of weapons transfers and concerns about U.S. military stockpiles, as the United States has already provided tens of billions in aid since Russia's 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation revealed that Meta's Instagram platform displayed paid advertisements promoting escort services and sex work channels on Telegram. The ads, some from accounts with over 100,000 followers, linked to Telegram channels explicitly offering access to women for "fun dates, relationships and hot sex." Meta has since removed the associated accounts and disabled their ad accounts, stating they violated content moderation policies against human exploitation and adult sexual solicitation. This incident highlights Meta's ongoing struggle to combat a rise in sexualized paid advertisements, following a previous investigation into "nudify" apps.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is escalating his opposition to the BRICS bloc, warning that their efforts to undermine the US dollar's dominance threaten America's economic supremacy. Trump vowed to impose an additional 10% tariff on any nation supporting the group’s "anti-American policies," building on existing trade levies. The BRICS bloc, now comprising ten members and several partner countries, represents a quarter of the global economy and nearly half the world's population, intensifying efforts to reduce reliance on the dollar through local currency trade. Experts note the bloc's anti-Western stance and ambition to alter the global order, though internal divisions hinder a unified currency.</p>

Dylan Earl, who previously admitted guilt, is the first person convicted under the new National Security Act.

Experts anticipate potential relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes. To improve eligibility for favorable rates, strengthening one's credit profile and comparing offers from multiple lenders are crucial steps.

Financial experts advise intentional saving rather than emotion-driven habits, recommending steps like taking a "money temperature" to assess spending and saving comfort. They also suggest "reverse budgeting," where money is first earmarked for savings goals, followed by necessary expenses and "fun money." Creating separate accounts for different goals and periodically increasing savings rates are also key strategies for building financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of July 7, 2025, the price of gold is $3,312.50 per ounce, according to American Hartford Gold, though this figure constantly fluctuates. Gold is considered a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge, making it attractive during economic uncertainty. Its price is influenced by supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and currency movements. Central bank policies and market sentiment also play significant roles. Investors often turn to gold when the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes or during geopolitical turmoil, driving up its value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Office summoned China's ambassador after a German aircraft involved in the EU's Operation Aspides in the Red Sea was targeted with a laser by the Chinese military. The incident, which endangered German personnel and disrupted the mission to protect commercial ships from Houthi militia, was deemed "entirely unacceptable." A German Defense Ministry official stated the Chinese warship targeted the aircraft "without any reason or prior contact," risking personnel and material. The mission was aborted, and the plane returned safely. China has not yet commented on the incident, raising concerns about maritime safety and international conduct.</p>

The regulator stated these failures demonstrated how "lacking Monzo's financial crime controls were," enabling the bank to onboard risky customers from outside the UK.

          <p>Malaysia, a multi-racial and Muslim-majority nation, is increasingly grappling with growing religious conservatism, marked by the rise of Islamic-oriented parties like the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, including PAS, achieved significant electoral success in 2023, pushing for policies aligned with conservative Islamic ideology such as implementing hudud and stricter dress codes. While Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's government adopts a "moderate Islam" approach, its actions indicate a response to the opposition's growing power. Experts suggest the rise of political Islam, fueled by disillusionment with the current system, poses a long-term challenge to Malaysia's multiethnic identity.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers claim a breakthrough in military communication with a new "telepathy" radio system that enables high-speed data transmission while ensuring combat units remain in absolute radio silence. Led by senior engineer Liu Kaiyu, the team developed a system allowing vehicles to send vast amounts of data without emitting active signals, potentially making People's Liberation Army combat units invisible in electronic warfare. This innovation addresses the long-standing dilemma of military radios, which provide crucial communication but also risk revealing user locations to adversaries.

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision upholding a Texas law requiring age verification for sexually explicit websites marks a definitive end to the internet's laissez-faire era. The ruling, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, signals a new willingness to regulate digital technology, particularly for child safety. The Court's application of intermediate scrutiny to age-verification requirements significantly lowers constitutional barriers for such regulations. This approach is likely to extend beyond pornography to platforms like social media and AI chatbots, as "Think of the children" emerges as a bipartisan consensus in tech-policy debates, empowering states to enact more age-based restrictions despite potential burdens on adult speech.</p>

          <p>In the Dutch fishing village of Urk, volunteers are using advanced DNA technology and artificial intelligence to identify and return the remains of fishermen lost at sea decades ago. The "Identiteit Gezocht" foundation aims to map unknown graves on North Sea coasts, utilizing AI to search press articles and historical data for links to missing persons. This initiative has already yielded success, with one man's remains identified 47 years after his disappearance. For families like Jan van den Berg's, whose father vanished 70 years ago, this modern approach offers a renewed hope for closure and the chance to properly mourn their loved ones.</p>

          <h2>New Bill May Reduce, But Not Eliminate, Taxes on Social Security Benefits for Seniors</h2>

          <p>The Social Security Administration sent a misleading email implying President Trump's "one big beautiful bill" would eliminate federal income taxes on benefits for nearly 90% of beneficiaries. Tax experts clarify that while the legislation includes an additional $6,000 senior deduction, it will reduce, not eliminate, tax liability for some, primarily middle-income seniors. The deduction, available for tax years 2025-2028, phases out for higher incomes and doesn't affect those already exempt. Furthermore, experts warn that these tax changes, estimated to reduce Social Security's tax revenue by $30 billion annually, will accelerate the program's projected insolvency date to late 2032.
