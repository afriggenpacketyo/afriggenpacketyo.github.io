          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the parent company of Tylenol, experienced a significant drop of over 10% following reports that a forthcoming federal study will suggest a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. The Wall Street Journal indicated the Health and Human Services report, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is expected this month. In response, Kenvue stated it has continuously reviewed the science and maintains there is no causal link, adding that the FDA and other medical organizations affirm the drug's safety for pregnant women. The report also purportedly suggests a folate-derived medicine could treat some autism symptoms.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is in the early stages of discussing potential limitations on the ability of transgender people to purchase firearms, according to Fox News Digital. Internal conversations have reportedly involved the Office of Legal Counsel, exploring a legal framework to address what one source described as a "pattern" of shootings by transgender individuals. A DOJ spokesperson downplayed the specific focus, stating the department is evaluating options to address violence linked to mental health challenges and substance abuse disorders without advancing specific proposals. The discussions have drawn immediate criticism from gun rights advocates, who have threatened legal action if any such policies are implemented.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved legislation raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 limit established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had curtailed a deduction that was previously unlimited for over a century. Proponents argue the higher cap provides relief to taxpayers in high-tax states, mitigating what they see as double taxation. However, fiscal analyses from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Foundation project the change will significantly increase the national debt by hundreds of billions over the next decade.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," a move intended to project a stronger image. While an official name change requires congressional approval, the administration is reportedly exploring workarounds. Trump argues the original name, used before 1947, coincided with a period of consistent military victories. The Department of Defense was created by the National Security Act of 1947 to unify the armed forces and, according to historians, to emphasize a strategy of deterring conflicts in the nuclear age. Critics worry the symbolic change could signal more bellicose foreign policy intentions.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Labor Market Slows Sharply with Only 22,000 Jobs Added in August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 14:18:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 22,000 jobs in August, falling significantly short of the 80,000 forecast by economists and signaling a sharp cooling of the labor market. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, while data for June was revised to show a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly decline since late 2020. This slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty, particularly surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs, which has made businesses hesitant to hire. The weak report increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting to stimulate the economy amid rising inflation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California officials announced that Sean Patrick McNulty, a Navy diver who died in 1997, has been linked through DNA evidence to at least six home invasion and sexual assault cases from the 1980s and 1990s. The cold cases spanned California, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, where McNulty was a suspect in a 1993 assault before his death by suicide. Investigators used investigative genealogy to identify him as a potential suspect, later confirming the match with a biological sample retained from the Indiana case. Authorities are continuing to investigate other potential crimes McNulty may have committed while notifying surviving victims and offering them long-awaited closure.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into the Los Angeles Clippers following allegations that a now-bankrupt firm, Aspiration Partners, paid star player Kawhi Leonard $28 million for a no-show job to circumvent the league's salary cap. Aspiration, in which Clippers owner Steve Ballmer was a major investor, also had a $330 million sponsorship deal with the team. Ballmer has denied any wrongdoing, stating he was "conned" by Aspiration's founder and that Leonard's contract extension was finalized before the player was introduced to the company. The scandal brings to light the strict NBA rules against such payments, designed to maintain competitive balance across the league.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable environment for reinvesting their funds. Letting a CD roll over automatically could lock in a much lower rate than previously enjoyed. Financial experts suggest exploring alternatives such as high-yield savings accounts, which still offer competitive rates with greater flexibility, or money market accounts that combine high interest with checking features. Another strategy is to lock in current rates with a new long-term CD, which provides security against future rate drops despite being lower than recent peaks. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece connects this to the mindset of Soviet-era dissenters, who maintained their opposition even when they knew it was futile.

          <p>A congressional investigation by House Republicans has found that the Pentagon funded hundreds of research projects over a two-year period in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes, some of which are linked to China's defense industry. The report from the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party argues that these partnerships have inadvertently allowed China to leverage U.S. research for its own military advancement. The committee warns that failing to protect American research from foreign exploitation erodes the U.S.'s technological dominance and poses a risk to national security. The Pentagon has not yet responded to the report's findings.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching EU competition laws by favoring its own services in the online advertising technology sector. The regulator found that Google engaged in "self-preferencing" by boosting its own ad exchange, AdX, over rivals, which led to higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers. This is the third time the EU has penalized Google for anticompetitive behavior, and the Commission has warned that the company may need to sell parts of its ad tech business to resolve the conflict of interest. Google has called the decision "wrong" and announced its intention to appeal the fine.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "Eternally Electric," pop icon Debbie Gibson reflects on her decades-long career, which began when she became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard No. 1 hit at age 17. Gibson credits her late mother, Diane, who served as her manager, for being instrumental to her success by fighting for her creative control in a male-dominated industry. She discusses her journey from a teenager writing songs daily in a makeshift home studio to navigating the pressures of the music business. Gibson says she is now thriving more than ever by embracing an independent spirit and a direct connection with her audience.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned as the UK's deputy prime minister and as deputy leader of the Labour Party after an ethics inquiry found she breached the ministerial code. The investigation concluded that while she acted with integrity, she failed to seek specialist tax advice on a property purchase, resulting in an underpayment of stamp duty. In her resignation letter, Rayner took full responsibility for the error. Her departure has triggered a major cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with David Lammy appointed as the new deputy prime minister and Yvette Cooper becoming foreign secretary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary piece in The Atlantic argues that Democrats are overusing the claim that President Trump's controversial actions are merely distractions from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The article suggests that by labeling everything from National Guard deployments to verbal attacks on opponents as a ploy to divert attention from the Epstein files, Democrats risk diluting the seriousness of Trump's authoritarian behavior. This strategy, the author contends, implies that the president's daily abuses of power are just stunts that can be ignored. It may also reveal a lack of a more effective opposition message and distract from other significant vulnerabilities of the administration.</p>

          <p>As Reform UK gains political momentum, its ambitious economic plans are facing increased scrutiny. The party's platform includes significant tax cuts, such as raising the income tax threshold to £20,000, and increased spending on public services, which would be funded by scrapping net-zero climate policies and cutting government waste. However, an analysis by BBC Verify questions these figures, noting that the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates net-zero costs to be lower than the party claims. Economists also express doubt that the proposed £50 billion in annual savings from "waste" could be achieved without substantial cuts to public services, suggesting borrowing would have to rise.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, the potential winner faces a significant reduction in their prize due to taxes. The lump sum cash option is valued at $826.4 million, from which the IRS mandates an immediate 24% federal withholding, amounting to nearly $198.3 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the top 37% federal income tax bracket, the final tax bill will be considerably higher. State taxes can further reduce the take-home amount, with some states levying income taxes over 10%, while others have no tax on lottery winnings.</p>

As part of the settlement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies.

The plan would award Musk 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and hitting production targets for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. The board argues the award is necessary to retain and incentivize Musk through a pivotal growth period.
