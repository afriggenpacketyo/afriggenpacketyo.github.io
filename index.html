          <p>A detailed report from Rolling Stone portrays Stephen Miller, a key Trump administration official, as a deeply influential and widely disliked figure, both during his time on Capitol Hill and within the White House. The article alleges that former Republican colleagues spread rumors about him playing with dolls to mock him, while President Trump reportedly gossiped about his awkward demeanor. The profile highlights Miller's significant power over immigration policy, where he has been nicknamed the "REAL Attorney General" for his role in controversial initiatives like detention camps and aggressive deportation tactics, which the White House has largely denied.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, held a "very different ideology" from his conservative family. Cox revealed that investigators have learned Robinson was in a relationship with and living with a partner who is transitioning from male to female. While authorities are still exploring a motive for the attack, the governor suggested Robinson had been influenced by "dark places of the internet" and indoctrinated with leftist ideology, according to information from his family and friends. Robinson is reportedly not cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Spanish Vuelta cycling race was cut short after pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted the event in Madrid, forcing organizers to end the race early for safety reasons. Jonas Vingegaard of the Visma-Lease a Bike team was declared the overall winner. Protesters blocked parts of the route with banners and clashed with police, leading to the cancellation of the podium ceremony. This incident was the culmination of numerous disruptions throughout the three-week tour, largely aimed at the presence of the Israeli-owned team, Premier Tech, which had previously altered its uniforms in response.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, a state law allowing permitted individuals to openly carry firearms on college campuses is facing renewed scrutiny. The law, which passed in August, has drawn concern from university staff about campus safety. While it is not yet clear if the suspected shooter legally possessed the rifle used, the timing of the incident has brought national attention to Utah's permissive gun legislation. The state lacks red-flag laws and allows permitless concealed carry, reflecting a legislative approach that prioritizes gun access as a deterrent to crime.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described as targeted, occurred during an outdoor debate event. Investigators tracked the suspect using security footage showing him on the roof of a nearby building, from which the single shot was fired. A high-powered rifle and bullet casings with inscribed messages were recovered. Robinson's father reportedly recognized his son from police photos and encouraged him to surrender, leading to his capture and subsequent charges including aggravated murder.</p>

          <p>Romania's defense ministry has reported that a Russian drone breached its airspace during an attack on Ukrainian infrastructure near the border, making it the second NATO country to report such an incident recently. The drone was tracked by Romanian F-16 fighter jets before it disappeared from radar, and officials stated it did not fly over populated areas or pose an imminent threat. The incursion follows a similar event where Poland shot down Russian drones in its airspace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the event as an "obvious expansion of the war by Russia," not a mistake.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the prince has not faced sufficient consequences and that every person involved, regardless of status, should be held accountable under the law. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability. The family emphasized that his loss of royal duties and public shaming are not enough.</p>

          <p>In local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU party is set to claim victory. However, the results also show a significant surge for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which more than tripled its share of the vote from 5.1% in 2020 to a projected 16.5%. While the CDU remains the strongest party, the AfD's dramatic gains reflect a growing rightward shift in western Germany. In contrast, the Green Party experienced a substantial drop in support, falling from 20% in the previous election to around 11.7%.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services Poses a Challenge to Traditional Banks and Credit Cards</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is creating concern within the traditional banking and credit card industries. These services, which allow consumers to make purchases in interest-free installments, are seen as a direct competitor for transaction volume that would otherwise go to credit cards. Financial institutions are also wary because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it harder for lenders to accurately assess a borrower's overall debt and financial risk.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel for discussions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aimed at mitigating the diplomatic repercussions of a recent Israeli missile strike in Qatar. The attack, which targeted Hamas leaders, has angered key U.S. allies in the Arab world, particularly Qatar, and raised questions about regional stability. Rubio's visit is intended to convey President Trump's displeasure with the strike while also reaffirming broad U.S. support for Israel's security. The trip occurs as Israel faces mounting international pressure over its actions in Gaza and the expansion of settlements.</p>
