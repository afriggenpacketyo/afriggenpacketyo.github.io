          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. hit 2.3% in April, which is the lowest since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report. This figure was slightly below economists' expectations. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, while the core CPI, excluding food and energy, also increased by 0.2%. Shelter prices were a main driver in pushing up the inflation gauge, and markets reacted little to the news. However, analysts warn that President Trump's tariffs could upend the picture in coming months, potentially leading to a surge in consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Argentinian court issued an international arrest warrant for Aung San Suu Kyi and 24 other Myanmar citizens, wanted on charges linked to genocide and crimes against humanity, specifically concerning the Rohingya ethnic minority. The court claims jurisdiction based on the principle that some serious crimes can be prosecuted regardless of where they were committed. The case focuses on the 2017 Rohingya crisis, during which thousands were killed and 700,000 fled to Bangladesh. While human rights organizations assert that genocide occurred, the International Court of Justice has yet to rule on the matter. Some question Aung San Suu Kyi's responsibility, considering her role as Myanmar's top civilian leader at the time, and her reluctance to condemn the military's actions.</p>

          <p>Andrew Witty resigned as CEO of UnitedHealth for personal reasons, prompting the company to suspend its 2025 financial outlook due to higher-than-expected medical costs. Stephen Hemsley, who previously served as CEO from 2006 to 2017, was appointed as the new CEO, effective immediately. Shares of UnitedHealth have declined since the death of former CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. The company cited that medical costs for many Medicare Advantage beneficiaries new to UnitedHealthcare were higher than anticipated, leading to the suspension of the financial outlook. Hemsley apologized for the performance setbacks, while Witty had previously acknowledged the flaws of the healthcare system in an op-ed.</p>

Despite claims of early violations, a US-brokered ceasefire appears to be holding, with senior military officials from both countries discussing implementation via a hotline.

The Crown Prosecution Service agreed that the DNA evidence undermined Sullivan's conviction and would not seek a retrial. Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history.</p>

The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3% from a year earlier, the slowest annual pace since early 2021. While recent tariff reductions with China have eased concerns, economists still anticipate that the scope and scale of the tariffs will eventually stoke inflation while simultaneously denting growth.

          <p>CBS News is tracking the change in prices of everyday household expenses, including food, utilities, and rent, as consumers cope with cost-of-living pressures and the potential impact of tariffs. The price tracker uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Zillow to show how the cost of goods and services has changed since before the pandemic to the most recent information available. Despite tariff reversal, some prices could still increase due to lingering cost-of-living pressures. The data is updated monthly to reflect the latest changes in prices.</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, the U.S. Deputy Attorney General who represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal trial, has been appointed acting librarian of Congress, leading to a showdown on Capitol Hill. This move follows the firing of Carla Hayden, who was criticized by conservatives. Democrats are concerned about the potential for Trump-appointed officials to access confidential information and the possibility of data being improperly transferred to the executive branch. Lawmakers are investigating whether Trump has the power to fire the librarian of Congress, who is technically a legislative branch employee.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, yet still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation, and energy costs also ticked higher. Economists are looking for early signs that President Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households, but the impact might not show up in economic data for a few months due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The Federal Reserve is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth.</p>

The bill outlines plans to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, making more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. It also includes a permanent extension of Trumpâ€™s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act and a tax proposal that would hike the cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT).

          <p>Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, cooling slightly and defying fears of an inflation surge after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. Egg prices fell, while gasoline prices dropped over the past year. Trump paused a large swath of so-called "reciprocal tariffs" and temporarily slashed tariffs on China. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.

Trump has rolled back most of the tariffs he announced in early April, but imports from China face a 30% levy, and most other US imports still face a 10% levy.
