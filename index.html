          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz denied a motion by the government to stay the ruling for seven days, indicating that he will issue an order requiring Khalil's release today. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, had been detained based on the Secretary of State's determination that his presence posed a risk to foreign policy, but the judge later sided with the government on grounds of misrepresentation on his green card application. The judge asked the parties to consult with a magistrate judge about conditions for Khalil's release on bail.</p>

          <p>Brent oil prices experienced a decline of over 2% following President Donald Trump's decision to delay potential strikes against Iran, expressing hope for upcoming negotiations regarding the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Brent, the global benchmark, fell $2.12, or 2.69%, to $76.73 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil rose 4 cents to $75.18 per barrel. Despite Trump's stance, Israel is intensifying its attacks on Iran, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordering the military to escalate strikes on strategic and government targets after an Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel. The decision to postpone military action is providing space for diplomatic efforts, yet tensions in the region remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

The companies argued that Trump lacked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously blocked Trump's tariffs, but a federal appeals court allowed them to remain in effect pending arguments on the case.

The scheme involved bribes such as cash, NBA tickets, and a country club wedding, and is alleged to be part of a $550 million scam. Roderick Watson, a USAID contracting officer, admitted to accepting bribes in exchange for his influence, with contractors funneling payoffs through a subcontractor to conceal their actions.

          <p>Tesla has signed its first deal to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, a project expected to be the largest of its kind in the country. The 4 billion yuan ($556 million) deal involves Tesla, the local government of Shanghai, and financing firm China Kangfu International Leasing. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems are crucial for maintaining balance on electricity grids, particularly with the increasing reliance on intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. Tesla stated that its Shanghai battery factory produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of this year.</p>

          <p>The film *Materialists*, directed by Celine Song, explores modern dating through the eyes of Lucy, a professional matchmaker who sees relationships as transactions based on net worth and superficial criteria. Lucy finds herself in a love triangle between a wealthy private-equity partner and a struggling actor, forcing her to confront her own values and the competing versions of herself. However, the film's attempts to critique modern dating while delivering a traditional love story fall short, resulting in a tonally inconsistent and emotionally shallow narrative. The movie ultimately lacks the depth and insight of Song's previous work, *Past Lives*.</p>

          <p>The increasing practice of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks during enforcement actions is raising concerns about accountability and public safety. Critics argue that masking contradicts Homeland Security regulations, undermines agents' authority, and creates a perception of a secret police force. While ICE claims agents wear masks for protection, this practice can confuse bystanders, potentially leading to interference with enforcement actions. Some argue that Congress should ban the use of masks by immigration agents to ensure transparency and accountability.</p>

Trump's attorneys argue that they should be allowed to appeal the court's rejection of Trump's attempt to have the government substitute for him in the case before oral arguments take place. The Justice Department contends that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within the scope of his presidential role, justifying their defense in court. The 2nd Circuit recently upheld a separate $5 million damage award to Carroll.</p>
