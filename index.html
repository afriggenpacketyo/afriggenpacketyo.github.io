          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scammers who falsely claim that artificial intelligence can predict questions on the national college entrance examination, known as the gaokao, which is a high-stakes test for over 13.3 million students. The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security are jointly investigating and cleaning up "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Scammers are reportedly selling mock papers online at inflated prices, claiming they use AI to predict actual questions, and some social media accounts are falsely claiming access to "top secret" information. The government's announcement emphasized that some are exaggerating information to attract traffic and induce candidates and parents to buy simulated test questions and reference materials at high prices.</p>

          <p>Melissa Andreatta's first game as head coach for Scotland's national football team resulted in a defeat and relegation to Nations League B, leaving her with a baseline understanding of the team's current state. Austria secured a deserved victory at Hampden Park, with Julia Hickelsberger's goal proving decisive, while Scotland struggled to create significant chances. Andreatta acknowledged that the transition would take time, and the team's performance in the first half was notably lower than expected. Despite a flurry of changes bringing some fight and finesse, Scotland's efforts were ultimately "too little, too late," according to player Lee Gibson.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks and a Â£2bn investment, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened, aiming to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. Initially conceived in 1990 and started in 2002, the 28-mile upgrade involved constructing nearly 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. The project also included planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact, offsetting over seven million kilograms of CO2 annually, and relocating creatures such as bats and newts. Financed using the Mutual Investment Model, the Welsh government will pay over Â£40m annually for 30 years for the road's maintenance by a private firm until 2055.</p>

Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his rhythm and focus, attributing some of his success to his new lifestyle after the birth of his daughter.

          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing its stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers to combat soaring rice prices, with major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. being the first to sell the cheaper products. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags of rice sold out in just 30 minutes, while long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. The government is offering 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022, with Ito-Yokado securing 5,000 tons and Iris Ohyama 10,000 tons. This effort marks a shift from previous auctions, as the government hopes direct sales will be more effective in curbing rice prices.</p>

This show of force followed the airing of footage showing Chinese military drills in contested waters near the Spratly Islands, highlighting Beijing's ability to take military action in the event of "sudden military threats." The Southern Theatre Command of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) stated that it deployed forces to patrol the waters and airspace as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen control over the area this month.

Greece, however, is resistant to accepting a potential influx of 20,000 to 30,000 migrants from Germany, and hopes for an agreement with Libya to manage immigration flows.</p>

Despite these setbacks, the administration remains determined to pursue its economic agenda, though the legal spats have added uncertainty for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender girl, is at the center of a legal, political, and cultural debate as she competes in the California State Championships. Hernandez, who transitioned and now competes against girls, is a favorite to win in the long jump and triple jump. Her participation has sparked protests and a plane flew over the stadium with a banner reading "No boys in girls' sports." The issue has also drawn national attention, with President Trump threatening to withdraw federal funding from California over Hernandez's participation.</p>

The case is expected to be a decisive test of the president's authority to employ such measures in immigration enforcement.

The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022.

Lula's support for oil exploration in the Foz do Amazonas and other projects contradicts his promise to achieve zero deforestation by 2030.

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill includes a 3.5% tax on remittances made by non-U.S. citizens, which is expected to significantly impact Africans who rely on these financial transfers. Remittances are a major source of income for many African economies, often outweighing aid and foreign direct investment, with the U.S. being a primary origin country for these funds. Experts warn that the tax could disproportionately affect lower-income groups and prompt migrants to use unofficial channels to avoid the levy. Some African countries, such as Lesotho and Somalia, are particularly dependent on remittances, which can account for around 20% of their GDP. (not investment advice)</p>
