          <p>An opinion piece analyzes US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth's aggressive stance against China at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, questioning its effectiveness in Southeast Asia. The author contrasts Hegseth's views with those of his predecessor and highlights the economic ties between Southeast Asian nations and China. The article suggests that Trump's administration may not share Hegseth's hawkish view on China and that Southeast Asian countries do not view China as an existential threat like European allies view Russia, making the US approach less persuasive in the region. Hegseth's lack of familiarity with ASEAN members further undermines his credibility in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the potential impact of AI on job displacement and the US budget reconciliation bill's shortcomings in addressing this issue. It contrasts the existential concerns about AI in the Bay Area with the more quotidian policy discussions in Washington, DC. The bill's proposed moratorium on state-level AI regulation and cuts to clean energy subsidies are criticized for potentially hindering responsible AI development and exacerbating its negative consequences. The author argues that the bill's emphasis on work requirements for social programs is particularly problematic in a world where AI could automate a significant portion of human labor, potentially making these requirements cruel and ineffective.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States and China have reached a trade deal, pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping. The agreement reportedly includes tariff cuts, Chinese rare earth exports to the US, and the continuation of Chinese students attending American colleges. Trump stated that the US would receive 55% tariffs while China would receive 10%, characterizing the relationship as "excellent." This announcement follows a period of strained relations and comes after phone call between Xi Jinping and Trump last week helped fuel a sense of cautious optimism ahead of the London talks.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly stated that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, saying they "went too far." This comes after a public dispute between the two, which had previously been close allies, leading Musk to spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump's administration. The conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with Musk arguing it would undermine DOGE's work and increase the US budget deficit. Trump had previously indicated there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates opposing the bill, but later softened his stance.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly frustrated with Meta's position in the AI race and is willing to invest heavily to bring Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang into his company. Meta is finalizing a deal to invest $14 billion in Scale AI, potentially taking a 49% stake, with Wang expected to lead a new AI research lab at Meta. This move comes after lukewarm reception to Meta's Llama AI models and a reorganization of its GenAI unit. Zuckerberg admires Wang's technical expertise and business acumen, viewing him as a "wartime CEO" capable of bolstering Meta's AI ambitions amid increasing competition from China.</p>
