          <p>The once-close relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated into a public feud, with Trump threatening to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies and Musk suggesting Trump couldn't have won the election without him. The conflict began after Musk criticized Trump's tax-cut and spending bill, leading to an online exchange on Truth Social and X. Billionaire Bill Ackman urged the two to reconcile, while others like Steve Bannon suggested Trump should seize SpaceX and suspend federal contracts with Musk's companies. Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed Musk's proposal for a new political party, and Ian Bremmer commented on the power dynamic between the two. </p>

Japan is weighing accepting a cut in tariff rates while continuing to demand the elimination of the higher tariffs, but the United States is resisting a full removal of the duties.

Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were to take effect. The order responds to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.</p>

It argues that this constant conflict distracts from important societal issues, such as the implications of the Republicans’ budget-reconciliation package. The piece concludes that while the feud may entertain, it ultimately reflects a societal tendency toward abstraction and obfuscation.</p>

          <p>Victims of the Los Angeles County fires have filed lawsuits against AAA and USAA, alleging that the insurers systematically underestimated the replacement cost of their homes, leading to inadequate coverage. The lawsuits claim fraud, negligence, and breach of contract, seeking damages and reform of the insurers' practices. The plaintiffs argue that cost estimator software and perverse incentives contributed to the underinsurance problem. The suits open a new front in the litigation spawned by the fires, which caused significant damage and loss of life.</p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space flight, as part of efforts to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications that do not need encryption keys. A laser module and a phase encoding device were tested on a rocket that reached 2.5km. The test is a key step in China’s transition to constructing a quantum secure direct communication network. This is considered complementary to quantum key distribution.</p>

          <h2>Young Offenders Often Denied Credit for 'Dead Time' Behind Bars</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults in the criminal system. This adds months to their confinement, negatively impacting their rehabilitation and wasting resources. Experts argue that the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation has led to unequal application of fundamental rights. While the system is meant to treat children as children, the lack of time credit perpetuates disparities and allows kids to languish without proper services or education.</p>

The safest way to renew vehicle registration is directly through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by appointment at a DMV office.</p>

A multi-agency search that included search-and-rescue teams, canines, underwater cameras and aerial searches lasted for nine days in the river and surrounding areas. However, snowpack melt from higher elevations and elevated river flow rendered the search area too hazardous for rescue staff to conduct thorough searches, according to the release.</p>
