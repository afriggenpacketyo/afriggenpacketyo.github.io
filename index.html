          <p>A party yacht named "Timeless" struck a dock pylon on the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street. The incident occurred around 4:15 p.m. while the 200-foot boat was attempting to dock near Riverside Park. Thirty-five people sustained non-life-threatening injuries, with twenty-two requiring hospitalization. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, and the yacht sustained some damage as well, but overall the partygoers were grateful that nobody died in the accident.</p>

          <p>The United States conducted airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, marking a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran. President Trump announced the strikes, calling them a "spectacular military success" and warning Iran to pursue peace or face further attacks. The strikes involved B-2 bombers dropping Massive Ordnance Penetrators and Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a U.S. Navy submarine, and while Iran acknowledged the attacks, they claimed the strikes would not halt their nuclear program. The U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically stating that the strikes are all the U.S. plans and that regime change efforts are not planned.</p>

          <p>The United States' recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have sparked a debate among lawmakers regarding the constitutionality of the action and the president's war powers. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other Democrats have argued that President Trump should have consulted Congress before ordering the strikes. These lawmakers are demanding that they be immediately briefed on the attacks in a classified setting, and this has raised questions about whether or not Congress has the right to be consulted prior to military action.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers from both parties have expressed mixed reactions. Republicans such as Senators Graham and Cruz largely supported the action, while some, like Representative Greene, opposed it. Democrats, including House Leader Jeffries and Senator Schumer, criticized the President for not consulting Congress and demanded immediate briefings, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution. Senator Fetterman, however, voiced his full support for the strikes, and this issue has highlighted the ongoing debate about presidential authority in foreign conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites, the potential outcomes range from optimistic to catastrophic. The best-case scenario involves the end of Iran's nuclear ambitions and the fall of the mullahs, while the worst-case sees Iran accelerating its pursuit of a nuclear weapon and retaliating against U.S. targets. A more likely outcome involves a delayed Iranian nuclear program and increased regional instability, but the success of the strikes depends on accurate intelligence and competent leadership. The situation is further complicated by the potential for Iranian retaliation and miscalculations, as well as the uncertain influence of key advisors.</p>

          <p>Despite stating he would decide within two weeks whether to strike Iran, President Trump ordered a U.S. military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities just two days later. Trump had said he was giving Iran time to "come to their senses," but dismissed talks between European diplomats and Iran's foreign minister. He claimed Iran only wanted to speak with the U.S., and the announcement frustrated Israeli officials who had been pushing for U.S. military involvement. Furthermore, Trump contradicted his own intelligence community's assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, which was an assessment which he dismissed.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are implementing "property supermarkets," both online and offline, to aid the struggling housing market. Chengdu is the latest city to launch a homebuying platform in partnership with state-owned and private developers, and similar initiatives have been introduced in cities like Suzhou and Shandong. These platforms aim to improve transparency, streamline services, and minimize false promotions by centralizing information and bundling services like mortgage applications and property registration, and these efforts seek to revive China's property sector amid declining housing prices and subdued buyer sentiment.

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rebuke of his own Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, calling it "shocking." Reed suggested Trump is disavowing his intelligence community for political reasons, especially as it relates to Iran's nuclear capabilities. Reed added that if Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony, "there would be an obligation to correct the record immediately, not just in the wake of this activity by the Israelis to suddenly conclude that she was totally wrong," and this issue has highlighted the ongoing debate about presidential authority in foreign conflicts.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband Bob was overturned after she spent two decades in prison, and new testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and foreign male DNA.

Despite the overturned conviction, Dorotik's case was dismissed without prejudice, leaving open the possibility of charges being brought again if new evidence surfaces.</p>

The action breaks from Trump's prior pledges to keep the United States out of war, and Trump had previously promised to "prevent World War Three" and end "chaos in the Middle East." Concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions are not new, and Trump has long cited his 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal as evidence of his tough stance on Tehran.</p>
