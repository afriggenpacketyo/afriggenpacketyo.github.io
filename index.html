          <p>At least 24 people have died and between 23 to 25 remain missing after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming the area during a holiday weekend. A significant number of the missing are from Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp that sustained severe damage and lost power and communications. Hundreds of emergency personnel are engaged in extensive search and rescue operations using helicopters, drones, and water rescue teams.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline approach despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy. What initially appeared to be a severe, season-ending knee injury was diagnosed as only a bone bruise, with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. Confident that Muncy will return well before the playoffs, the team's management intends to rely on internal roster options to fill the gap rather than pursuing an urgent trade for a replacement.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, New York City, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. City officials utilized drone technology and lifeguard patrols to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure public safety. The closures were brief, and the beaches were reopened to the public within an hour after authorities confirmed it was safe for beachgoers to return to the water.</p>

          <p>On the Fourth of July, hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles to demonstrate against the Trump administration's ongoing immigration raids and a new bill allocating billions more in funding for enforcement. The march, which moved from City Hall to the Federal Building, was a response to weeks of aggressive ICE actions that have created a climate of fear in immigrant communities. The event underscored the deep-seated tensions between local California leaders and the federal government over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The German women's national team started its Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, with goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. The win was marred, however, by a potentially serious knee injury to team captain Giulia Gwinn, who was forced to leave the match in the first half. Given Gwinn's history of two previous ACL injuries, her potential absence casts a significant shadow over Germany's prospects for the remainder of the tournament.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order that raises entry fees for non-U.S. residents visiting America's national parks and other federal recreation sites. The order also mandates that U.S. citizens receive preferential treatment in any park lotteries or permit systems. Additionally, the directive revokes a 2017 memorandum aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the management and storytelling within the national park system.</p>

          <p>Ongoing tensions between India and China are creating complex dynamics within international blocs like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The requirement for consensus within the group was recently highlighted when a joint statement from defence chiefs was blocked due to India's objections over language concerning terrorism. This event illustrates India's growing role as a strategic counterweight to China's influence, challenging Beijing's ambitions for undisputed leadership within Global South-based alliances.

          <p>An interventional cardiologist with two decades of experience treating heart disease has identified five common foods he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the bags, flavored yogurts because of high sugar content, processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats, sugary cereals, and deep-fried foods. He argues these items contribute to inflammation and chronic illness, and recommends healthier, whole-food alternatives instead.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team claimed a dramatic, last-ball victory over India by five runs in a T20 match at The Oval.
