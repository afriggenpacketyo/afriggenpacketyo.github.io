          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second consecutive night of serious disorder, with petrol bombs, projectiles, and fireworks thrown at police. The unrest, described by police as "racially motivated," led to officers firing baton rounds and using a water cannon to disperse protesters, who set a car on fire and damaged homes. The violence followed an earlier peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, prompting condemnation from political figures and raising concerns about community tensions related to migrant integration. One assembly member recounted how a family with three young children had to barricade themselves into their attic for safety. </p>

          <p>Argentina's highest judicial authority has validated a corruption conviction against former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The ruling upholds a prison sentence that Kirchner was appealing, effectively barring her from returning to politics as she had planned. The conviction stems from charges of corruption during her time in office. The court's decision marks a significant blow to Kirchner's political ambitions and solidifies the legal consequences of her past actions. </p>

          <p>A UN panel has urged the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, citing concerns that the agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius, but the UK retained the right to operate a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel argues that preventing the Chagossian people from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to return. The panel calls for the current deal to be suspended and for a new agreement to be negotiated. </p>

          <p>Residents of Graz, Austria, held a candlelight vigil for the victims of a school shooting that claimed the lives of 10 people. The gunman, a former student, took his own life after the attack, which is the deadliest in the country's recent history. Three days of mourning have been declared in Austria, with a nationwide minute's silence held to honor the victims. Police are investigating the motive of the gunman, who legally owned the two guns used in the attack. </p>

Lawyers argue that these questionings often lack sufficient probable cause, violating the Police Duties Execution Act. The National Police Agency has issued advisories to avoid racially motivated questioning, but advocates believe more needs to be done to address public indifference to prejudice issues. </p>
