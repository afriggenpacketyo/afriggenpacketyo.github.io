          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles after attempting to ask questions about immigration enforcement. Padilla, who identified himself as a senator, was escorted out of the room, allegedly forced to the ground, and handcuffed before being released. DHS claimed Padilla interrupted the press conference without identifying himself, while Padilla stated he was seeking information on DHS's actions and was met with excessive force. The incident sparked outrage from fellow Democrats, with California Governor Gavin Newsom calling it "outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful."</p>

          <p>A congressional report indicates that President Donald Trump's tariff policies have led to rising prices for common baby items. The cost of five essential baby gear categories, including car seats, bassinets, and strollers, increased by 24% between April 1 and June 9. The report, based on data from baby registry website Babylist, highlights the risk to baby gear sold in the U.S. due to the high percentage manufactured in China. While some companies plan to mitigate the impact, others have already raised prices, potentially impacting new parents' budgets significantly.</p>

AMD's rack-scale technology aims to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, offering a cost-effective alternative with lower power consumption. AMD is planning to compete against rival Nvidia on price, with a company executive telling reporters on Wednesday that the chips will cost less to operate thanks to lower power consumption, and that AMD is undercutting Nvidia with "aggressive" prices.

          <p>Following Britain, China has reached a trade deal with the US, putting pressure on the EU amidst ongoing tariff disputes. The US and China reached a breakthrough to end their tariff war, although details remain unclear, and key elements await formal approval. The EU, in contrast, has adopted a restrained approach, engaging in intensive talks, pushing for a "zero-for-zero" trade agreement to eliminate tariffs on industrial goods. With the US prioritizing deals with China and the UK, the EU faces increasing pressure to secure a favorable trade agreement.</p>

          <h2>GOP Tax Bill Could Cost Low-Income Americans $1,600 Annually, CBO Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 15:57:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis reveals that the Republican tax bill could reduce financial resources for the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year. The bill's tax breaks, reductions in federal program funding, and changes in matching state funds, particularly cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, contribute to the reduction for low-income individuals. Conversely, the highest-earning 10% of households would see an increase of $12,000 per year, while middle-income households would gain $500 to $1,000. The analysis could fuel criticism that the bill favors the wealthy while harming vulnerable households. (not investment advice)</p>

Lucy is weighing comfort versus struggle in the film, with the script letting her say and do all the crass things that usually belong to the rom-com villainess. The film explores themes of self-actualization and whether a sensible girl can justify shackling herself to a broke creative. The reviewer notes that the film has great moments, but is ultimately brought down by a happy ending that doesn't seem believable.</p>
