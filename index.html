          <p>Despite China's significant trade relationships and diplomatic efforts, key US allies in Europe and Asia are not shifting their strategic alignments away from Washington. This resistance is rooted in deep-seated security integrations, intelligence-sharing pacts, and shared cultural values that outweigh purely economic considerations. While nations engage with Beijing on issues like climate and maintain trade worth nearly a trillion dollars with the EU, their foundational security commitments to the United States remain their primary focus. This dynamic highlights the persistent gap between China's global ambitions and the geopolitical realities of established alliances.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has escalated its aerial and ground bombardment of Gaza City in preparation for a large-scale offensive aimed at dismantling Hamas. The operation has intensified pressure on the nearly one million Palestinians in the area, with residents reporting continuous explosions. The Hamas-run health ministry reports dozens of fatalities in the last 24 hours, bringing the total since the conflict began to over 62,000. The UN and other organizations warn of a "horrific humanitarian impact" as Gaza's infrastructure has collapsed.</p>

          <p>Israel is mobilizing up to five IDF divisions and 60,000 reservists for a planned full-scale offensive on Gaza City, considered a Hamas stronghold. Military analysts describe the operation as an unprecedented challenge due to the city's dense urban environment and extensive underground tunnel network. The strategy involves a slow, methodical advance to clear Hamas's military capabilities and search for hostages, though experts warn of immense costs and casualties on both sides. The fate of the remaining hostages and the difficulty of evacuating civilians present significant dilemmas for the Israeli military.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce delays and cut the costs associated with housing migrants in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the creation of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to handle appeals more swiftly, as the current process averages over a year. The move comes amid pressure to end the use of asylum hotels, which currently house 32,000 people. Advocacy groups like the Refugee Council argue that the focus should be on improving the quality of initial decisions to reduce the number of appeals.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine celebrated its 34th Independence Day, Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack across the country, while Ukraine conducted its own long-range strikes on Russian territory. Ukrainian officials reported intercepting many of the 72 Russian drones, though some hit targets, while Russia claimed to have shot down 95 Ukrainian drones over 14 regions. Ukrainian attacks reportedly caused fires at a Russian oil refinery and a gas terminal. The exchange of fire occurred as President Zelenskyy received messages of support from international leaders, including US President Donald Trump.</p>

The documents, surfacing in a lawsuit, show that former Superior General Pedro Arrupe, whose cause for canonization is active, knew of concerns about Donald B Dickerson but did not ultimately prevent him from becoming a priest. Dickerson went on to abuse other minors, raising profound questions about institutional accountability and the standards for sainthood within the Catholic Church as this historical failure comes to light.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has adopted a combative, no-holds-barred political strategy to counter President Donald Trump, marking a significant shift from his earlier, more conciliatory approach. This new tactic includes launching a special election to redraw congressional districts in a partisan manner, directly challenging a similar Republican move in Texas. Newsom is also using aggressive, Trump-like rhetoric and social media tactics to rally his base and portray himself as a fighter for Democratic values. This pivot is seen as a high-stakes move that could define his national political future ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

Using radiology and aviation as examples, the article argues that imperfect automation tools can undermine human skill and lead to critical errors when human oversight is required as a fail-safe. A collaborative model, like a pilot's heads-up display, leverages AI's data-processing power while keeping the human expert engaged, leading to better outcomes.

This division manifests in actions like refusing to endorse mainstream Democrats and adopting resolutions that alienate average voters.

Survivors recount harrowing stories of being trapped by floodwaters that inundated 80% of the city.

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, threatening to remove her from office and implement a full federal takeover of the city. Trump's threats follow his recent order to deploy federal law enforcement and National Guard troops, citing what he claims are high crime rates, a claim disputed by reports showing a 30-year low. The president has accused Bowser of falsifying crime statistics without evidence and warned that "bad things will happen" if she does not change course. This represents a major escalation in the conflict between the White House and the capital city's local government.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend and Hall of Famer Pam Shriver is spearheading a foundation called Village Rising to help rebuild Southern California communities devastated by recent wildfires. The organization focuses on revitalizing schools and sports programs, using tennis as a central tool to bring families together and restore a sense of normalcy. Shriver, a Brentwood resident whose own home was spared, was motivated by the widespread destruction affecting friends and neighbors. The foundation aims to identify overlooked parks and schools, raise funds, and distribute grants quickly to support recovery in areas like the Pacific Palisades and Altadena.</p>

          <p>A rapid escalation in partisan gerrymandering, led by Republicans in Texas at President Trump's urging and countered by Democrats in California, is raising concerns about the future of American democracy. Both of the nation's most populous states are pursuing mid-decade redistricting to maximize their party's congressional seats, abandoning norms of fairness for raw political power. This aggressive, tit-for-tat approach reflects a new political reality where established processes, like independent commissions, are being sidelined in a high-stakes battle for control of Congress. Experts warn this could further disenfranchise voters and entrench political polarization.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide a critical case concerning the extent of immigration agents' power to stop, question, and detain individuals based on suspected illegal status. The Trump administration is appealing a lower court's order that restricted agents in Los Angeles from making stops based solely on factors like ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or being in a location known for day laborers. The administration argues that agents should have broad authority based on "reasonable suspicion," which they contend can include ethnicity. The ruling could have significant consequences for millions of Latinos in Southern California and nationwide.</p>

          <p>Members of the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission, which drew the state's current political maps, are expressing mixed feelings about Governor Newsom's proposal to replace their congressional map with a partisan gerrymander. While some commissioners are proud of their non-partisan work and oppose the move on principle, others see it as a necessary, if regrettable, response to Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas. The debate highlights the tension between upholding principles of fair representation and engaging in partisan warfare to counter the actions of political opponents on a national scale.</p>

The strikes come as prominent Nigerians raise alarm over "war-time levels of slaughter" in parts of the country, citing a recent report of over 10,000 deaths since President Bola Tinubu took office. The government continues to face significant security challenges from jihadist insurgencies, criminal gangs, and widespread kidnappings.</p>

          <p>The White House has published a list of art and scholarship at the Smithsonian Institution that it deems objectionable, targeting works that focus on race, immigration, and sexuality. This follows a directive for a "comprehensive review" to align the museums with President Trump's cultural vision ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. Artists and scholars on the list have responded with a mix of shock, defiance, and concern, with some calling it a "badge of honor" and others fearing a chilling effect on artistic expression. Critics compare the move to McCarthyism and authoritarian attempts to control cultural narratives.</p>
