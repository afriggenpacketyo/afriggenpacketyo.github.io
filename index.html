          <p>Former Congressman George Santos is scheduled for sentencing in Long Island, New York, after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors seek an 87-month prison term, citing his lack of remorse and fabricated biography used to defraud voters and donors. Santos, who helped Republicans secure the House in 2022, faces significant restitution payments and acknowledges the cost to his reputation and livelihood. The sentencing will determine the extent of his punishment for conduct that prosecutors claim made a mockery of the election system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists suggest that President Trump's persistent calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates might not translate into lower borrowing costs for consumers. Trump's attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his tariff policies could actually keep long-term interest rates elevated due to market concerns about inflation and the Fed's independence. An independent Fed is seen as crucial for maintaining stable inflation, and threats to its autonomy could spook investors, leading to higher rates and market instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council reports that Sudanese people are resorting to eating leaves and charcoal to survive after fleeing an attack on a camp for displaced people near El-Fasher. People are dying of thirst and exhaustion while traveling from Zamzam camp to Tawila, a 40km journey in blistering heat. The RSF attacked the Zamzam camp earlier this month, displacing tens of thousands who had already been living there for two decades due to previous conflicts in Darfur, and the RSF has been battling the army for the past two years in a war that has killed tens of thousands and forced some 13 million people from their homes.</p>

Currently, cycling offenders face a maximum of two years in prison, but the new legislation aims to ensure that those who recklessly disregard others face the full force of the law.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new carnivorous caterpillar species on Oahu, Hawaii, dubbed the "bone collector" for its unique habit of adorning its silk case with the body parts of its spider prey. This behavior is thought to provide camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feed on insects trapped in spiderwebs without being detected. The predatory caterpillar is rare, with scientists finding only 62 in over 20 years, and its origins date back at least 6 million years. Researchers are urging conservation efforts to protect this unique lineage.</p>
