          <h2>China's Rising Bond Yields Amidst Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-20 23:36:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent rebound in Chinese government bond yields, economists predict that persistent deflationary pressures will likely keep borrowing costs low.  The rise is attributed to factors like the People's Bank of China's actions and market shifts, but underlying economic weakness persists, with low consumer sentiment and weak credit demand.  This situation suggests that cheaper loans, while offered by banks, may not significantly stimulate the economy without a broader confidence boost.<br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>
