          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny's summer concert residency in San Juan has become a powerful, emotional touchstone for Puerto Ricans, especially for those who have moved away from the island. Titled "I Don't Want To Leave Here," the event has drawn thousands from the diaspora back home, fostering a sense of communal healing and cultural pride. The concerts celebrate Puerto Rican traditions and have reportedly inspired attendees to reconnect with their heritage and even consider returning to the island permanently amidst ongoing economic and social challenges.</p>

          <p>Consumers across the United States are facing rapidly increasing electricity costs, which have climbed more than twice as fast as overall inflation in the past year. This surge is placing a significant financial burden on households, particularly during summer months when air conditioning use is high. Key factors driving the price hikes include the increased power demand from new AI data centers and the rising cost of natural gas, which is influenced by growing international exports of liquefied natural gas.</p>

          <p>The summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska has drawn widespread criticism and disappointment from international leaders and U.S. legislators for failing to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine. While some Republican senators expressed cautious optimism about future talks, many Democrats accused Trump of being "played" by Putin and called for Congress to pass stronger sanctions against Russia. In Ukraine, the reaction was largely negative, with officials noting that the lack of a concrete agreement allows the conflict to continue unabated, though President Zelenskyy has accepted an invitation to Washington.</p>

The airline stated it had offered a significant compensation increase, but the union rejected it as being below inflation and market value, leading to the widespread travel disruption across its global network.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors have significantly influenced the city of Athens by becoming the primary participants in Greece's investor residency scheme, known as the "golden visa" program. By purchasing thousands of apartments, Chinese citizens now constitute nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60 percent of those who have renewed their visas. This trend reflects a broader strategy by Chinese nationals to secure residency in European Union countries through real estate investment, quietly transforming the local property market and demographics of the Greek capital.</p>

          <p>Despite high expectations and elaborate staging, the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, concluded without a tangible deal to end the war in Ukraine. Following less than three hours of talks, Trump acknowledged that while progress was made, "we didn't get there," with key sticking points remaining unresolved. Putin indicated that the "root causes" of the conflict must be addressed, suggesting no change in his demands, while Trump deferred the next steps to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who is now scheduled to visit Washington.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are publicly voicing concerns about the sustainability of the expanding U.S. national debt, prompting calls for Beijing to gradually reduce its exposure to American Treasury holdings. China has already been trimming its holdings, which are near their lowest level since 2009, reflecting a strategic pivot amid worries over long-term financial stability. The researchers advocate for diversifying the nation's reserves by increasing holdings of gold and other strategic resources to mitigate potential risks associated with U.S. dollar assets.
