Following the positive report, Microsoft's market capitalization officially surpassed the $4 trillion mark, making it the second company after Nvidia to reach this milestone.

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations, leading to a jump in its stock price. The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, attributing the strong performance to improvements in its retail pharmacy operations and its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner highlighted a "multiyear recovery effort" at Aetna, which has been managing higher medical costs, and noted investments in pharmacy technology and labor have boosted efficiency. While the insurance and retail segments showed strength, this was partially offset by a decline in the health services division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Irish court has dismissed Conor McGregor's appeal in a civil case where he was found to have sexually assaulted Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel in 2018. McGregor, who was previously ordered to pay over £200,000 in damages, had appealed on the grounds that his "no comment" answers during police interviews should not have been presented to the jury. His lawyers also contested the wording on the jury's issue paper. The Court of Appeal rejected these arguments, stating there was no "real risk of unfair trial" and that the jury was not confused by the questions presented.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing a legal challenge that could significantly impact the president's ability to impose tariffs, a cornerstone of Donald Trump's trade agenda. The case, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, questions whether the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact a wide-ranging tariff regime. Plaintiffs argue that the power to set tariffs constitutionally belongs to Congress, not the executive branch. The outcome of this case could determine the future of the administration's "reciprocal" tariff policy, which has been a source of market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not run for governor of California, ending months of speculation about her next political move. In a statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she decided her public service would not be in elected office for now, though she remains committed to fighting for Democratic values. Sources close to Harris indicated she seriously considered the role but felt she could have a greater impact on the national stage. This decision keeps the door open for a potential presidential run in 2028 as she plans to campaign for other Democrats.</p>

Key challenges include a perceived lag in its artificial intelligence strategy, lingering trade uncertainties with potential tariffs, and major legal battles, such as the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google. Analysts suggest that to regain Wall Street's favor, Apple needs to demonstrate strength in its Services revenue, provide clarity on its supply chain diversification, and show increased investment in generative AI to drive a future iPhone upgrade cycle.

These fake products, often sold through unregulated online pharmacies, may contain no active ingredients or harmful substances.

While the commission found the spot-fixing charges "not proven," it did find Paqueta guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation.

The law allows the president to apprehend or remove citizens of a hostile nation during wartime without due process, based on ancestry rather than individual actions. Civil rights advocates and descendants of those interned argue the law is discriminatory and dangerous, pointing out that it was used to incarcerate over 120,000 people.

According to simulations, the compact device could produce a first pulse with a peak power of 16.6 gigawatts, with subsequent pulses remaining above 10 gigawatts.

Critics point to ICE's history of financial mismanagement and the potential for funds to enrich private-prison companies with close ties to the administration.

          <p>Meta's stock jumped significantly after the company reported second-quarter revenue that beat analyst estimates and provided a strong forecast for the upcoming quarter. The social media giant's sales grew 22% year-over-year, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributing the gains to AI-driven efficiencies in its advertising system. The company also announced it would increase its capital expenditures, with a focus on an aggressive AI talent acquisition and infrastructure development strategy, including a new Meta Superintelligence Labs unit. These results highlight Meta's heavy investment in AI as a primary driver of future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, signaling a growing strain in their relationship. Trump stated that images of children in Gaza show "real starvation stuff," directly refuting Netanyahu's assertion that there is no famine. Administration officials suggest Trump believes Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict for political reasons, in defiance of U.S. wishes for the war to end. Despite the disagreement, the White House has not indicated any significant shift in U.S. policy and continues to blame Hamas for the breakdown in ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>A new NHS England report has concluded that healthcare providers repeatedly failed to listen to parental concerns in the case of Yusuf Nazir, a five-year-old boy who died from a lung infection in 2022. The report found 13 missed opportunities to escalate his care and noted that a reliance on clinical metrics over his mother's instincts led to fragmented care and a lack of trust. Yusuf was sent home from a hospital emergency department and died eight days later from pneumonia and sepsis. His family is now demanding a full inquest and accountability, insisting that the NHS must learn from these tragic failings.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade deal with South Korea, the sixth-largest trading partner of the U.S., ahead of a looming deadline for imposing higher tariffs. Under the agreement, South Korean goods will face a 15% tariff, which is lower than the previously threatened 25%, while U.S. imports will not face tariffs. The deal also includes a $350 billion investment fund from South Korea for U.S.-controlled projects and a commitment to purchase $100 billion in American energy products. This agreement is one of several the administration has secured as it continues negotiations with other major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation increased in June, indicating that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to elevate the prices of many goods. The Commerce Department reported that prices rose 2.6% compared to a year ago, up from May's 2.4% pace and above the Fed's 2% target. Significant price increases were seen in heavily imported goods like furniture, appliances, and computers. This uptick in inflation helps clarify the central bank's decision to hold its key interest rate steady this week, despite pressure from the administration to implement a cut.

          <p>With a key deadline for President Trump's trade policy approaching, the U.S. wholesale and distribution industry is expressing significant concern over the impact of widespread tariffs. The $8.2 trillion sector, which accounts for a substantial portion of GDP, anticipates major disruptions and cost increases that will likely be passed on to consumers. Industry leaders report that companies have paused orders, leading to low inventory levels for items like holiday goods, and are actively seeking new global markets to bypass U.S. trade friction. Experts warn that price increases are inevitable as the industry cannot absorb the high tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>
