        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, which was based on cases brought by small businesses and state governments. Global markets responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining against safe-haven currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to reform the pension industry, including the creation of Â£25bn "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the reforms would improve returns for workers and increase investment in clean energy and high-growth businesses. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is also including a legislative back-stop to ensure progress by the end of the decade. The reforms are expected to unlock over Â£50bn of additional investment in UK infrastructure, new homes, and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, as demand grew ahead of potential negative impacts from higher US tariffs on imported cars.

This surge comes as U.S. President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States on April 3. Despite the sales increase, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) has scrapped its proposed "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community, including the mayor and lawmakers. The proposed system would have altered grading standards, potentially allowing students with scores as low as 21 to pass with a D. Critics argued that the changes would not adequately prepare students for success. SFUSD Superintendent Maria Su stated that there have been no changes to grading practices and that the district aims to support student success by prioritizing learning and mastery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his commitment to bolster advanced manufacturing, a strategy that could conflict with the Trump administration's demands in ongoing trade talks. While Trump seeks to address trade imbalances and end state subsidies to Chinese companies, China's push for self-reliance, especially in high-tech sectors, is unlikely to be scaled back. Experts anticipate continued trade tensions and tariffs, with little scope for China to significantly alter its manufacturing-led strategy. The "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer, but has faced challenges and criticisms.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has accused Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of promoting "fantasy" economics, likening him to former PM Liz Truss and warning that Reform's policies could increase mortgage costs. Starmer argues that Farage's unfunded tax cuts could spark an economic meltdown, similar to the turmoil caused by Truss's mini-budget in 2022. Reform has pledged more generous tax breaks and to scrap certain climate measures to fund its policies, but economists have questioned the feasibility of these plans. The speech highlights the growing political rivalry between Starmer and Farage.</p>

          <h2>Israel Faces Criticism from German Chancellor Merz Over Gaza Conduct</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, describing it as "beyond comprehension," prompting a measured response from Israel. Merz's remarks, made in response to an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced civilians, represent unusually clear criticism from a leading German politician. Experts suggest that the muted Israeli response indicates that Merz's comments have resonated within the political elite. The criticism comes amid growing international concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the potential for Israel to be losing its standing in the Western community.</p>
