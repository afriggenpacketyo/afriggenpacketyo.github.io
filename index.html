            <p>Dr. Kevin Hall, a top NIH researcher on ultra-processed foods, resigned, accusing aides to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of censorship. Hall claims he was blocked from a New York Times interview and his research was edited without consent after a study showed ultra-processed foods weren't addictive like drugs. The study, which controlled diet in a hospital setting, challenged preconceived notions about ultra-processed food addiction. An HHS spokesperson denies the claims, but Hall questions their definition of censorship, stating he was also blocked from presenting research at a conference and given an ultimatum regarding a manuscript.</p>

            <p>China is shifting its retaliatory tactics against the U.S., moving beyond tariffs on goods to target the American services sector. This shift follows China's declaration that further U.S. tariff increases are a 'meaningless numbers game.' Beijing is implementing non-tariff restrictive measures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals and antitrust probes into American companies. These actions signal China's intent to inflict pain on U.S. businesses and accelerate the decoupling of the two economies, according to analysts, especially after Beijing went after Boeing by ordering Chinese airlines not to take any further deliveries for its jets.</p>

            <p>Gold prices have surged to a fresh record high as investors seek safe-haven assets amid growing concerns about the impact of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. The precious metal is seen as a safer investment during economic uncertainty, especially as the dollar weakens under trade-policy pressures. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments suggesting that tariffs are likely to slow U.S. economic growth and increase consumer prices have further fueled investor interest in gold, viewed as a hedge against inflation and government recklessness.

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide power outage, affecting approximately 1.4 million customers and highlighting the fragility of the island's electrical system. The outage was attributed to a combination of factors, including a failure in the protection system and vegetation on a transmission line. LUMA Energy, the private company responsible for power transmission, estimates that it could take two to three days to restore service to 90% of customers. The blackout has sparked renewed criticism of the island's aging infrastructure and the performance of LUMA Energy, with many residents calling for changes.</p>

            <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem has canceled $2.7 million in DHS grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about 'anti-American, pro-Hamas ideology' on campus. The university has been ordered to submit records by April 30, or risk losing its certification to enroll international students. The canceled grants include funding for violence prevention and public health messaging programs that DHS deemed ideologically skewed.

The groups support the government's aims of improving productivity and wages but argue the bill could damage employment, especially for those on the margins of the labor market.
