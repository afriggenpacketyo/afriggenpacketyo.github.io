          <p>Federal agents, accompanied by approximately six FBI vehicles, conducted a search of former Trump national security adviser John Bolton's Maryland residence for over an hour on Friday morning. Local police initially blocked entrances to the street, though they have since departed. While agents were seen entering and exiting the home, it remains unclear if anything was removed or the precise nature of the federal investigation. Such a high-profile search involving a former top White House official suggests a significant inquiry, potentially related to classified documents or other governmental matters, and is likely to generate considerable political and media speculation as the story develops.</p>

          <p>John Deere is at a critical juncture, facing weaker demand in the agricultural sector, which has led to significant decreases in net income and sales. The company recently announced 238 layoffs in Illinois and Iowa, adding to thousands over the past year, citing reduced orders and a struggling farm economy. Despite these challenges, Deere is making a "bold move" to invest $20 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, driven by confidence in future trade deals and tax policy. Analysts suggest that while the short-term remains uncertain, the long-term outlook for the company, particularly in precision agriculture, appears more optimistic as the cyclical industry is expected to rebound.

          <p>Texas Instruments' ambitious $60 billion U.S. manufacturing megaproject, comprising seven new chip fabrication plants, is gaining momentum with Apple's commitment to produce critical foundation semiconductors for iPhones there. This move comes amidst new tariffs on chips not manufactured in the U.S. and Apple's increased U.S. spending. While TI's shares initially dropped due to weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts see the company as a "tariff winner" due to its U.S. foundries potentially undercutting rivals. The project, aiming to increase TI's capacity fivefold and create 60,000 U.S. jobs, is a significant bet on regaining market share and reshoring semiconductor production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government's Home Office is seeking to appeal a High Court ruling that granted a temporary injunction to Epping Forest District Council, preventing asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized the government's commitment to closing all asylum hotels in a "properly managed way," not through piecemeal court decisions. The council argued the hotel's presence risked escalating community tensions, especially after a recent sexual assault charge involving an asylum seeker. This ruling has prompted other councils to consider similar legal action, further complicating the government's efforts to house a rising number of asylum seekers.</p>

Markets are keenly awaiting his speech for indications on a potential September rate cut, though some Fed officials express caution. Powell is also expected to provide his views on broader economic conditions and potentially retool the Fed's long-term inflation targeting framework, which allowed inflation to run hot in the past. This address is crucial for shaping financial market sentiment and clarifying the central bank's policy trajectory while navigating ongoing controversies and striving to preserve its independence.

          <p>David Marcus, in an opinion piece, criticizes Cracker Barrel for its recent rebrand, arguing it has abandoned its authentic, old-timey charm for a "lifeless and cold" corporate aesthetic. The new logo, which removes the iconic old man, and modernized interior designs are seen as a move towards uniformity, akin to other brands accused of "wokeness." Marcus suggests these changes erase traditional Americana rooted in white experience, turning the brand into "corporate slop." He urges the company to reverse these unpopular choices, fearing the changes cut customers off from a cherished past and its unique cultural identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The presence of U.S. warships near Venezuela highlights the country's significant role in the international oil trade, despite its current low production. Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at 303 billion barrels, accounting for 17% of global reserves. However, U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 on the state oil company PDVSA have severely hampered its production, limiting it to just 0.8% of global crude in 2023. Recent reports indicate a 15% year-on-year increase in PDVSA's exports in 2024, but the ongoing geopolitical tensions and sanctions continue to complicate Venezuela's full potential in the global energy market.</p>

          <p>A new FEMA policy mandating an email address for disaster aid applications is raising alarms among current and former officials. This change, following an executive order to discontinue paper-based payments, could significantly hinder vulnerable victims, particularly those with limited internet access, the elderly, and disabled individuals. Critics argue it's an arbitrary barrier, contrasting with the previous administration's efforts to simplify aid access. Concerns are heightened by FEMA's simultaneous reduction in door-to-door canvassing and field offices, limiting direct assistance for those unfamiliar with online processes. This rule, alongside other bureaucratic changes, is feared to delay urgently needed aid and disproportionately affect communities with technological limitations.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Governance Style Characterized as "Government by Shakedown"</h2>

          <p>Steven Greenhouse argues that Donald Trump's presidency has replaced the rule of law with a "government by shakedown," where he uses threats to cripple finances or exports to force compliance. This style, applied to universities, law firms, and trading partners, often violates federal law and the constitution, as evidenced by court rulings against his tariffs and broadsides. Greenhouse criticizes the passive response from Congress and the Supreme Court, which he views as enabling this "coercive," "arbitrary," and "corrosive" approach to governance. He asserts that Trump's methods, including demanding payments for chip sales or imposing tariffs to influence foreign justice systems, dangerously erode the rule of law and democracy.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Meadowlands, once a notorious dumping ground, has undergone a "Lazarus-like" resurrection, now serving as a vital salt marsh home to diverse wildlife. Decades of state and federal policies have fostered an unusual balance of waste disposal, development, and environmental protection. However, this progress is threatened by the 2023 Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA, which restricted the Clean Water Act's reach, potentially jeopardizing 71 million acres of wetlands nationwide. While state laws still protect the Meadowlands, experts worry about public perception and the unraveling of federal protections, emphasizing the delicate balance required to sustain this unique urban ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A new 1% tax on remittances, part of President Trump's spending bill, is set to significantly impact the world's poorest families, effective January 1, 2026. This "hidden tax" is projected to drain billions from countries heavily reliant on these payments, with Haiti alone potentially losing $61 million annually. Immigrant workers globally send four times more money home than wealthy nations provide in foreign aid, making remittances a vital social safety net for basic needs. While digital transfers are exempt, many vulnerable recipients lack bank accounts, forcing cash-based transfers to incur the tax. Critics argue this policy will destabilize countries and push more people into extreme poverty, with minimal benefit to the U.S. budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is undertaking a "continuous vetting" process to review the records of over 55 million visa holders for potential violations of entry or stay conditions. Visas may be revoked for indications of overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, or support for terrorist organizations. This initiative is part of President Donald Trump's broader anti-immigration agenda, which includes social media vetting for hostility towards U.S. values and recent restrictions on worker visas for truck drivers. The policy also involves requiring substantial deposits for tourist visas from certain countries, reflecting a significant tightening of immigration and visa regulations.</p>

With the regime controlling less than half the country and millions displaced, international monitors are likely to reject the polls.
