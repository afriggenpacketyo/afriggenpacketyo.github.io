          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark, New Jersey, during a protest. According to the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, Baraka ignored multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials to leave the facility, resulting in his arrest. The mayor, a Democrat running for governor of New Jersey, has been a vocal opponent of the detention center, with his administration filing a lawsuit to block its opening due to permit and city code violations. The incident has been described by Homeland Security as a "bizarre political stunt.</p>

The performance balanced Lamar's principled stoicism with SZA's exuberant moodiness, creating a dynamic experience where competing visions of vengeance could coexist.

          <p>The Camogie Association of Ireland is facing mounting pressure to relax its rule mandating skorts for players, with critics labeling the enforcement as "sexism." Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams argues that players should have the choice between skorts and shorts for comfort and performance reasons. A recent Gaelic Players Association survey indicated that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% desire the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for 22 May to vote on the issue, as some players threaten to boycott matches if forced to wear skorts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested an 80% tariff on Chinese goods coming into the U.S., ahead of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland. This figure would be nearly half of the current 145% tariff on Chinese goods. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that any reduction in tariffs would require China to make concessions. The Trump administration initially imposed widespread tariffs on multiple countries, later adjusting the proposal to a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, prompting China to respond with tariffs on U.S. goods.</p>

The brothers were initially sentenced to life in prison without parole, but former DA George GascÃ³n requested their sentences be reduced due to modern understandings of sexual abuse and trauma.

          <p>Individuals can collect both Social Security benefits and annuity payments without penalties, providing a stronger financial foundation for retirement. Social Security benefits do not have income limitations that would prevent receiving income from an annuity.

Strategies to maximize income include delaying Social Security, laddering annuities for flexibility, and consulting a retirement income specialist.</p>
