          <h2>Chicago Area Faces Rare Dust Storm Causing Near-Zero Visibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 18:49:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility. The event, unusual for the area, led the National Weather Service to issue warnings about dangerous driving conditions, especially on major highways like Interstates 55 and 57. Visibility dropped dramatically in Chicago, affecting operations at Midway International Airport. Meteorologists noted that this was the first dust storm warning ever issued for Chicago by the Romeoville Weather Service office, recalling a similar but deadlier event in 2023 and the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, created a dramatic scene, turning day into night.</p>

          <p>A bomb exploded near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulting in one death and damage to the clinic and surrounding buildings. The explosion, which occurred less than a mile from downtown, is being investigated as an intentional act of violence, according to Palm Springs fire chief, Paul Alvarado. The make and model of the vehicle was unclear. All that was left of it at the scene was an axle. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, confirmed that its IVF lab and stored embryos were unharmed, although the office space sustained damage. Federal and local authorities are on the scene investigating the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. This decision aligns with a series of cases where courts have emphasized that immigrants must have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when the administration claims novel powers. Legal scholars have praised the courts' defense of due process, while also expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place, as the Trump administration is openly flouting the idea of providing due process to immigrants awaiting deportation.</p>

          <p>Severe tornadoes swept through Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, resulting in at least 27 fatalities and numerous injuries. In St. Louis, a tornado caused significant damage, including the collapse of part of a church, trapping and killing one person. Kentucky was also heavily impacted, with at least 18 deaths reported. The storms are part of an especially brutal spring tornado season in the region, following similar destructive events weeks earlier. The National Weather Service is facing staffing shortages, potentially impacting forecasting and warning capabilities. The storms have also complicated disaster relief efforts due to recent staffing and funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new social studies curriculum will require high school students to "identify discrepancies" in the 2020 election results. This revision, championed by State Superintendent Ryan Walters, includes examining graphs and information related to the halting of ballot counting, mail-in ballot security risks, and unforeseen voter numbers. The curriculum changes, which also involve removing education about Black Lives Matter and George Floyd's murder, have faced criticism from parents, educators, and even some Republicans. Concerns have been raised about the potential for misinforming students and imposing personal beliefs, especially in conservative areas of the state.</p>

          <p>Hamas has proposed a new ceasefire deal that includes releasing more hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. The talks, mediated by Qatar and the US, come as Israel launched a major offensive in Gaza, resulting in hundreds of casualties. The proposed deal also includes allowing increased aid into Gaza and evacuating medical patients. Israel has yet to respond publicly but has previously stated it would not withdraw troops or commit to ending the war.

          <p>President Donald Trump endorsed the idea that the Supreme Court's temporary block on his administration's ability to deport Venezuelans, accused of being gang members, without due process, was an “illegal injunction.” Trump reposted posts made by attorney Mike Davis, calling the court’s decision “illegal” and claiming it was “heading down a perilous path.” This endorsement is a reversal from Trump's previous praise of the court when they ruled in his favor. The president has lashed out at federal judges for ruling against him in dozens of cases – an act that Chief Justice John Roberts warned against.</p>

          <p>At least 25 people have died and dozens are injured after tornadoes tore through parts of two US states, Kentucky and Missouri. About 140,000 properties in Missouri and Kentucky were left without power. Officials in St Louis said the fire department was conducting house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas. Authorities in Kentucky said there were also severe injuries reported. The tornadoes struck an area of the US that is generally referred to as "Tornado Alley", where tornadoes are most frequent.</p>

          <p>Home Depot has launched its Memorial Day outdoor sales event, which is a critical period for the company, with gardening and landscaping materials heavily discounted. Bernstein analysts cited "unfavorable weather, weak consumer sentiment, and mixed performance from peers and suppliers" as factors playing into what they predict to be a tough first quarter at Home Depot. The company's performance is closely tied to housing turnover, with mortgage rates needing to dip below 6.5% to stimulate the market. Tariff impact is also a concern, though those headwinds could be slowly fading amid de-escalation between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth." The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. The creature, about the length of an index finger, had a circular mouth lined with teeth and claws extending from its head. Researchers noted that the Mosura's body included 16 segments lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods, and had an open circulatory system. The discovery of the Mosura gives scientists better insight into how diverse life on Earth was even prior to the Cambrian explosion.</p>

In the recording, Mr. Hur's conclusion—that a jury would see Mr. Biden as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory”—is not merely valid, it is irrefutable.
