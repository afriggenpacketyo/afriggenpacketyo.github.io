          <p>A 61-year-old man was killed and 13 others, with ages ranging from 7 to 61, were injured after a lightning strike occurred at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey. The incident happened during a severe thunderstorm that prompted a warning in the area. Bystanders performed CPR on the deceased victim before emergency services arrived, and the injured were transported to local hospitals for treatment. This marks the third notable lightning strike incident in the Tri-State Area in the past month, highlighting the dangers of recent weather patterns.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources indicate she was given a memo citing the president's powers under Article 2 of the Constitution for her dismissal. Comey was a prominent prosecutor, having led the case against Sean "Diddy" Combs and contributing to the prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father, James Comey, was fired as FBI director by President Trump in 2017, adding a layer of political context to this recent termination.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Marta, an undocumented street vendor in Los Angeles, illustrating the profound fear and economic disruption caused by recent, widespread immigration raids. For years, she has worked to support her family but now feels constant anxiety, forcing her to reduce her work hours and rely on her children for financial support. The story highlights a broader community sentiment of uncertainty, where many undocumented workers, even those without criminal records, are staying home, impacting local economies. Marta's experience reflects the daily struggle of living under the threat of deportation and family separation.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month, contracting by 0.5% in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a rise. This decline is largely driven by a significant drop in shipments to the U.S. and China, with auto exports to the U.S. falling over 26% as carmakers appear to be absorbing the cost of new American tariffs. With exports accounting for nearly 22% of its GDP and no trade deal with the U.S. in sight, there are growing concerns that the Japanese economy could enter a technical recession. The situation is complicated by upcoming elections, making concessions on agricultural imports politically difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data obtained by CBS News on nearly 100,000 deportations under the Trump administration reveals a discrepancy between public messaging and actual enforcement priorities. While the administration stated its focus was on removing the "worst of the worst," less than 1% of deported individuals had homicide convictions, and only a small fraction had convictions for other violent crimes like sexual assault. The data indicates that a majority of infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses, and about 57% of those deported had never been accused of any crime. This analysis challenges the administration's narrative about the primary targets of its intensified immigration enforcement actions.</p>

Notably, the contentious issue regarding the Chinese-operated Darwin Port, which Australia wants to reclaim on security grounds, has been deliberately avoided by both sides. Analysts suggest this focus on economic common ground is a strategic effort by China to strengthen ties amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

Although Trump publicly stated that firing Powell is "highly unlikely," a senior White House official had earlier indicated the move was probable. The potential dismissal raises complex legal questions about whether the president has the authority to fire a Fed chair for cause, a matter that could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. Experts fear such a move would undermine the central bank's independence, comparing the potential economic trajectory to countries with politicized central banks. (not investment advice)</p>

When police attempted a traffic stop, the suspects reportedly fled, reaching speeds over 80 mph and driving into oncoming traffic before being boxed in and apprehended. The incident has prompted the local State's Attorney to criticize Illinois' SAFE-T Act, which eliminated cash bail, arguing it allows repeat offenders to be released and endangers the public.</p>

His comments followed a Pentagon order to withdraw half of the deployed troops, a move Newsom attributed to the administration realizing the "absurdity" of the deployment. The governor argued that the troops had a low utilization rate and that the administration's crackdown was terrorizing communities rather than targeting violent criminals. Newsom also repeated a threat to redraw California's congressional districts to favor Democrats in response to similar GOP efforts.</p>

          <p>A recent federal raid on a Nebraska meat processing facility, which resulted in the arrest of over 70 workers, has exposed significant flaws in the E-Verify system. The company's owner stated he had used the system in good faith to confirm employment eligibility, but experts say the system is easily fooled as it vets documents, not people, making it susceptible to identity theft. A Homeland Security official described the business itself as a victim of a larger criminal scheme involving stolen identities. Critics argue E-Verify is a "wink-and-nod" system that allows politicians to seem tough on immigration without imposing major economic costs.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The legislation addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer affordable options to manage missed mortgage payments. The new law will allow veterans to move delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current and allowing them to resume payments. This fix comes after months of pressure from veterans' groups and the mortgage industry to rectify the gap in support for struggling veteran homeowners.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the termination of a key FEMA program for pre-disaster mitigation. The suit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision they claim rests with Congress. The BRIC program funded local projects like stormwater control and elevating buildings in flood-prone areas. The states contend that halting the program jeopardizes projects already in development and leaves communities at higher risk from natural disasters, with a disproportionate impact on counties that supported President Trump.</p>

          <p>Key federal programs designed to combat social isolation among older adults, such as the Senior Companion Program, could be at risk due to funding cuts in President Trump's new domestic spending bill. Social isolation is a significant health risk, linked to increased rates of dementia, heart disease, and premature death. Program directors worry that losing federal funding, which in one New Orleans case amounts to nearly $300,000, would force them to shut down, leaving vulnerable seniors without vital companionship and support.

          <p>The Trump administration's rationale for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid, which it claims is justified by "waste, fraud, and abuse," is facing significant scrutiny. Former and current officials, including the fired USAID inspector general, state that the administration has provided little to no proof for these claims, suggesting the cuts are politically motivated. Officials with knowledge of the review process allege that programs were marked for termination based on keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than on an assessment of their effectiveness.

The legal claim asserts that freeholders received undisclosed fees from insurance companies, which were then passed on to leaseholders through inflated service charges. Lawyers argue these commissions are unlawful and are seeking compensation that could amount to £2,000 per flat owner. The issue has gained prominence as building insurance costs have soared since the Grenfell Tower fire, potentially increasing the value of these percentage-based commissions for freeholders.</p>
