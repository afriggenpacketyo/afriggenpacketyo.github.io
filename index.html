          <p>Rodney Hinton Jr. has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly intentionally hitting and killing a Hamilton County Sheriff's deputy with his car. This incident occurred a day after Hinton's 18-year-old son, Ryan Hinton, was shot and killed by Cincinnati police during a chase following a call about a stolen car. The officer involved claimed Ryan Hinton pointed a gun at him, and body camera footage captured an officer yelling about a gun before shots were fired, though there was no indication Ryan fired at police first. Ohio's Governor Mike DeWine expressed his dismay, calling it an intentional act of violence, and the prosecutor has vowed to pursue the case aggressively.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated in an interview that he relies on his lawyers to follow the law and doesn't know if he is supposed to uphold the Constitution. He also mentioned that he would not seek a third term as president, despite teasing the possibility in the past, and that he wouldn't fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his term ends in 2026. These remarks were made during an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," where Trump addressed various topics related to his administration and future plans. Trump's comments on the Constitution have sparked controversy, raising questions about his understanding and commitment to the foundational principles of the United States.</p>

With more than 98 percent of the votes cast inside Romania counted, Mr. Simion was far ahead of 10 rival candidates, garnering more than 40 percent. A partial count of the votes of Romanians living abroad, who generally tilt hard right, also gave Mr. Simion a big lead. The results, though incomplete, ensured Mr. Simion a slot in a runoff on May 18 against the likely second-place finisher, Nicusor Dan, the centrist mayor of Bucharest, Romania‚Äôs capital.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on all movies "produced in Foreign Lands" via a post on his Truth Social platform, claiming it's a national security threat due to messaging and propaganda. He stated he has authorized the Department of Commerce and the US trade representative to immediately begin instituting such a tariff, although he gave no details on how it would be implemented. This action follows China's reduction of American movies allowed into the country in April as a response to previous tariff announcements. The tariffs would significantly impact western studios, especially Walt Disney Company, Paramount Global, and Warner Bros Discovery Inc.</p>

Vardit Ravitsky emphasizes that egg freezing is a gamble, with risks even for those who become pregnant, and criticizes the emphasis on profits within the fertility industry. Critics also accuse companies of offering egg freezing as a benefit to retain female employees rather than genuinely helping them. The article also highlights the story of Evelyn Gosnell, whose frozen eggs did not produce a viable embryo, underscoring the emotional and financial risks involved.</p>

          <p>Wind farms in La Guajira, Colombia, aim to shift the country from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but they also create division within the Wayuu indigenous communities. While some benefit from clean water, better roads, and new houses, others complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, and disrespect for cultural norms. The Wayuu's traditions and beliefs are deeply tied to nature, and the wind farms disrupt their connection to the spiritual world. Concerns have led to disputes with energy companies and even conflict within Wayuu communities, highlighting the challenges of balancing environmental progress with cultural preservation.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming more common as women seek to preserve their fertility, but the process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. A single cycle costs $12,000 to $15,000, with additional annual storage fees and thawing/fertilization costs. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, many women pay out of pocket. Younger women are increasingly choosing egg freezing to avoid compromising on finding the right partner or rushing into parenthood. However, the biological clock remains a factor, as egg quality decreases with age, making the 20s the optimal time to freeze eggs.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular among women who want to preserve their fertility and increase their chances of having a baby later in life. The number of egg freezing procedures has increased significantly, and younger women are beginning to freeze their eggs. Women who have chosen to freeze their eggs say that it means they don't need to rush to find partners, and don't need to obsess over the ticking of their biological clocks. Dr. Tomer Singer believes that, one day, when it's more affordable and covered more frequently by insurance, almost all young women will freeze their eggs as a matter of routine.</p>

          <p>More than half of first-time buyers in 2024 received financial help from their families, averaging ¬£55,572 in loans and gifts, according to Savills. This assistance helped young buyers facing high mortgage rates and rising rental costs secure deals at lower mortgage rates. While the proportion of first-time buyers receiving family assistance was slightly lower than the previous year, it remained higher than most years since 2013. The findings highlight the continued impact of higher mortgage rates and tougher lending criteria on first-time buyers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed orders against several law firms, potentially destroying them for challenging his power, which is seen as a threat to the rule of law. These orders, described as a corporate death penalty, bar attorneys from courthouses and federal agencies and cancel law firm client contracts. In response, nine major firms made a deal with the White House, agreeing to provide nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by Trump. Some attorneys, like Brenna Frey, resigned in protest, while others, like Donald Ayer, argue Trump's actions violate constitutional rights and undermine the judicial system.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing involves a medical procedure where a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored for future use, but the process is costly, with a single cycle averaging $12,000 to $13,000, excluding storage fees and subsequent IVF treatments. Doctors emphasize that egg freezing does not guarantee success, as there is a drop-off at each stage from egg retrieval to successful birth. Jennifer Lannon from Freeze.Health highlights the financial burden, noting that while some employers offer coverage, most women pay out of pocket. Biomedical companies are working on advances to make the process easier and more affordable.</p>

This surge in production, coupled with fears of a recession due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, has led to a decline in oil prices.
