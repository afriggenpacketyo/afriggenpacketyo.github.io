            <h2>Trump's Economic Approval Rating Declines Amidst Public Discontent</h2>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has hit a low point due to widespread dissatisfaction over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a recent CNBC survey. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism since Trump's reelection, with a growing number of Americans anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents express significantly more negative sentiments regarding his economic policies, particularly concerning tariffs and inflation. Despite challenges, Trump maintains strong approval on immigration issues, specifically regarding border control and deportation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Canada is experiencing a surge in antisemitic incidents following the October 7, 2023, Hamas massacre, becoming a key issue for the Jewish community leading up to the federal election. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has condemned pro-Hamas protesters and pledged to deport antisemitic foreigners, while Prime Minister Mark Carney has also spoken out against antisemitism. Reports indicate a significant increase in antisemitic incidents, including vandalism, violence, and hate speech, causing many Canadian Jews to feel vulnerable and unsafe. Political figures and community leaders are calling for action to combat antisemitism and ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities across Canada.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, effective until midnight Sunday in Moscow, citing humanitarian considerations. However, this announcement has been met with skepticism in Ukraine, where officials claim that Russian forces are continuing attacks despite the declared ceasefire. The move follows a proposed 30-day ceasefire by the Trump administration, which Russia rejected, offering instead a 30-hour truce. Some observers view the truce as a public relations effort to improve relations with the Trump White House, while others see it as a genuine step towards ending the conflict.</p>

The Bank of England has cautioned against complacency regarding financial regulations implemented after the 2008 crash. Labour's approach to the financial sector, including openness to private equity investment, is under scrutiny amid concerns about shadow banking and potential economic shocks.</p>

While some cherished items were salvaged, the loss of their home and belongings has reinforced the idea that life is fleeting and that the world that existed before the fire lives in memory.

            <p>A six-meter-tall Evangelion Unit 01 statue has been installed at Hamamatsu city hall as part of a tourism campaign capitalizing on the city's connection to the popular anime film. The statue will be accessible to the public until late January next year, including on weekends and public holidays. The initiative, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the original TV series, follows previous Evangelion-themed campaigns in the area. The campaign aims to attract "anime pilgrims" and boost tourism in Hamamatsu.</p>

            <p>Human runners triumphed over humanoid robots in a half marathon in Beijing, despite the Chinese government's promotion of the event as a showcase for its robotics industry. Tien Kung Ultra, the winning robot, finished the race in 2 hours, 40 minutes, and 42 seconds, while the male human champion completed it in one hour, two minutes, and 36 seconds. Some robots struggled, with one running in the wrong direction and others failing to complete the course. Despite the current advantage of human runners, China is investing heavily in robotics, aiming to transform its manufacturing sector.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has dismantled democratic checks and balances, taken control of the country's media, civil society, and universities, and consolidated power in himself and his Fidesz party. Critics allege corruption, with Orban's government providing lucrative contracts to cronies. Orban's strategy, inspired by Vladimir Putin, involves targeting the media, exerting pressure on universities, and undermining institutions capable of checking his power. The dismantling of Hungary's democracy serves as a point of fascination for political scientists, with some drawing parallels to President Trump's actions.</p>

            <p>A Texas Easter tradition connects generations through the making and breaking of cascarones, confetti-filled eggs. Denise Solis continues the tradition with her son, Noah, after her mother passed away from stomach cancer, meticulously emptying and filling eggshells with confetti. Cascarones, common in Texas and Northern Mexico, symbolize fertility and rebirth, with the egg representing a new life. For Solis, cascarones are a powerful connection to the past, reminding her of her mother's love and care, as she watches her son and his friends joyfully cover each other in confetti.</p>

            <p>China has taken a more active role in the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, urging Kigali to end its support for the M23 rebel group. Beijing's UN ambassador has directly called on Rwanda to withdraw its troops from the DRC, and China voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role in the conflict. This shift from China's usual non-interference policy is driven by its need to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries. The move reflects a measured shift in Beijing’s approach.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following the introduction of President Trump's new tariff regime. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to multi-day delays for shipments over $800. The company will continue to deliver packages worth less than $800, which can be sent to the US with minimal checks. The White House is set to clamp down on deliveries under $800, specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong, on 2 May when it closes a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.</p>
