          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to them. This move is aimed at reinforcing existing policies and tightening loopholes, as both Huawei and SMIC are already on a U.S. trade blacklist and impacted by Washington's chip controls. The new export controls could also increase penalties for potential breaches in the future.</p>

The island chain strategy, conceived in 1951, aimed to contain communist powers using American-aligned island bases. The first island chain runs along East Asia's coastline, while the second includes Guam; China's navy is pushing past these strategic boundaries, testing the containment strategy.

The Scottish government views waste export as a short-term solution, while environmental consultants raise concerns about the environmental impact of transportation.

          <p>As anti-ICE protests continue across major U.S. cities, some rioters may face federal charges, potentially including "domestic terrorism," according to a retired FBI agent. The Department of Justice stated that "nothing is off the table" and will charge the most serious provable offenses, seeking the strongest sentences permissible by law against these domestic terrorists. Federal authorities may describe violent actions during protests as â€˜domestic terrorismâ€™ if there is evidence the individuals intended to intimidate the public or influence government decisions through force. Sen. Tom Cotton introduced bills to place stricter consequences on violent protesters, particularly those targeting federal agents.</p>

          <p>A new study finds that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of this century due to global warming. Warmer weather will cause upstream ice to break and drift downstream, refreezing and accumulating in colder areas. This localized hazard can cause destructive flooding, damaging downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. The study analyzed the dynamics of ice jam floods in the lower Yellow River over the past 160 years.</p>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has revealed serious concerns about the safety of funfairs, amusement parks, and theme parks in England, Scotland, and Wales. The investigation found 3,188 injuries between April 2014 and March 2024. Concerns are raised about the regulation of inspections and accidents linked to one inspector in particular. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has formally warned an inspector or his company about multiple safety breaches over the past 10 years, yet he was allowed to continue operating until recently.</p>
