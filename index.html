        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a pervasive crisis on UK high streets where organized crime gangs operate shops selling illegal tobacco and vapes, fostering an environment of fear and intimidation. In Newport, South Wales, 19 such shops were shut down in nine months, yet the problem persists as criminals use forced labor and "stash cars" to manage their illicit inventory. This article highlights the limited enforcement powers of local authorities, who describe an "endless battle" against a trade that undermines legitimate businesses, funds wider criminality, and deprives public services of millions in tax revenue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year and missed analyst expectations, primarily due to a staggering 94% profit plunge in its crucial chip division. The company attributed the severe downturn in its semiconductor business to inventory value adjustments and the adverse effects of U.S. export restrictions related to China. Despite the poor results, executives voiced cautious optimism for a second-half recovery, fueled by growing momentum in AI and a newly announced multi-billion dollar chip supply contract with Tesla.

This fundraising follows a trend of successful capital-raising efforts by other Chinese drug developers. According to industry analysts, this bullish sentiment is largely fueled by mainland investors actively buying shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese biotech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was compelled to make an emergency diversion to Minneapolis after encountering "significant" turbulence, which resulted in 25 people being transported to local hospitals. The aircraft, an Airbus A33-900 carrying 275 passengers and 13 crew members, managed to land safely where paramedics and fire department personnel were on standby to provide immediate medical attention. Delta confirmed the incident and the number of individuals hospitalized for evaluation and care.

          <p>Top Democrats in Texas are vehemently opposing a new congressional map proposed by state Republicans, condemning it as a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" plan designed to systematically dilute the voting power of minority communities. The draft map aims to convert five U.S. House districts currently held by Democrats into GOP-leaning seats by intentionally fracturing Black and Latino communities for political advantage. Critics warn that this "blatant gerrymander" likely violates the Voting Rights Act and could set a dangerous precedent, potentially triggering similar partisan redistricting battles in other states across the country.</p>

          <p>Filipina-Australian artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award at the Archibald Prize, Australia's most prestigious portrait competition, for a work she painted with her fingers. Spirovski turned to the unconventional technique due to a nerve injury that made holding a brush painful, using it to create a portrait of Aboriginal musician William Barton. She expressed her immense joy and gratitude, describing the public recognition as a "beautiful reprieve and reward" after enduring a difficult period with her health. The award celebrates her artistic resilience and innovative approach in the face of physical adversity.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has opted not to rush into a trade agreement with the Trump administration, despite the U.S. imposing 25% tariffs and an unspecified penalty on its imports. New Delhi's resistance is primarily driven by a desire to protect its large and politically sensitive agricultural sector from increased competition from American products. Analysts believe India is in a strong position to hold its ground, as its exports to the U.S. constitute a relatively small part of its overall economy. Furthermore, India is actively pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy by advancing trade deals with other major partners, including the UK and the EU, which provides it with significant negotiating leverage.

          <p>A jury in Arapahoe County, Colorado, has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for the 2023 poisoning of his wife, Angela.

The motive was presented as a combination of greed, involving a struggling dental practice and $4 million in life insurance policies, and betrayal, as he was engaged in extramarital affairs.

The data, which also showed contractions in new orders and employment, signals a potential economic slowdown in the second half of the year as the full impact of US tariffs becomes more pronounced.

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves and prompting emergency alerts across the Pacific Ocean. Tsunami warnings and advisories were issued for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, Japan, and several other Pacific nations, leading to evacuations in some coastal areas. The quake caused localized flooding on the Kamchatka Peninsula itself, but initial reports indicated no major damage or grave injuries elsewhere. While the most severe warnings were later downgraded as wave heights were less destructive than feared, the event demonstrated the reach and power of undersea seismic events.</p>

          <p>As the Major League Baseball trade deadline approached, a flurry of activity saw several contending teams make significant moves to strengthen their pitching staffs for the postseason push. In one of the biggest deals, the Philadelphia Phillies acquired hard-throwing closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins. The New York Mets also made a splash by adding two key relievers, Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley, to fortify their bullpen. In another notable trade, the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove-winning third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates, signaling an active market for high-impact players.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have successfully negotiated a trade agreement just ahead of a critical deadline, establishing a 15% tariff rate on South Korean imports. This rate is notably lower than the 25% that the Trump administration had initially threatened and aligns with the deal recently secured by Japan, a key competitor. As part of the pact, South Korea has committed to a $350 billion investment in the U.S., particularly in the shipbuilding industry. Seoul also achieved a major victory by successfully resisting U.S. demands to further open its highly sensitive rice and beef markets.</p>

          <p>A proposal by Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct a 10-mile underground transit loop in Nashville has ignited a political dispute between state and local leaders. The project, which would be privately funded and connect downtown to the airport, was announced with the enthusiastic support of Tennessee's Republican Governor. However, Democratic lawmakers in Nashville have raised serious concerns, demanding more transparency about the project's environmental impact, safety assessments, and the terms of a proposed "no cost" lease of public land to the company. The conflict highlights a growing tension over the project's rapid, top-down approval process.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of a devastating wildfire, Los Angeles officials have moved to restrict the construction of new duplexes in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood. This action was made possible by an executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom, which provided an exemption from a state housing law, SB 9, for the high-fire-risk area. The decision came after residents raised alarms that increasing population density could impede emergency evacuations in future fires. The move has drawn criticism from pro-housing advocates, who argue it undermines efforts to address the state's housing crisis and contradicts the city's simultaneous encouragement of accessory dwelling units (ADUs).</p>

The case was dismissed "without prejudice," which allows Baldwin's legal team the option to refile the claim at a later date.

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has formally submitted a competing proposal for the long-debated expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, directly challenging the plan put forth by the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, a design choice that would notably avoid the extremely costly and disruptive process of diverting the M25 motorway. The company asserts that its proposal, estimated to cost under £25 billion, offers a lower-risk and more cost-effective path to increasing the airport's capacity. This development introduces the first-ever competing bid for the massive infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis examines the tangible economic consequences of the Trump administration's aggressive tariff strategy, noting that the average U.S. tariff rate has soared to its highest point in nearly a century. While this policy has tripled the government's monthly tariff revenue, it has also contributed to a widening of the U.S. trade deficit, partly because firms stockpiled imports to avoid the taxes. The tariffs have significantly curtailed Chinese exports to the U.S., but China has successfully pivoted to other markets. Meanwhile, early data indicates that U.S. consumer prices for certain imported goods are beginning to rise. (not investment advice)</p>
