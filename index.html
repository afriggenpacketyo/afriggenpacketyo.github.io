          <h2>Remembering Charlie Kirk's Passion for College Football Following His Death</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 18:10:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers a tribute to the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, focusing on a lesser-known aspect of his life: his passion for sports, particularly college football. As a devoted fan of the Oregon Ducks, Kirk often posted about the team and shared photos with players like Bo Nix. The piece notes the lack of widespread in-stadium tributes on the first college football Saturday after his death but suggests his memory was honored by players and student bodies. It serves as a personal remembrance, highlighting a part of his identity beyond the political sphere.</p>

          <p>The legendary rock band Queen, represented by Sir Brian May and Roger Taylor, made a historic appearance at the Last Night of the Proms, performing a symphonic version of "Bohemian Rhapsody." The performance, which celebrated the song's 50th anniversary, featured the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus at London's Royal Albert Hall. The event marked the culmination of the eight-week Proms concert series and also included performances by comedian Bill Bailey and trumpeter Alison Balsom in her retirement concert. The evening concluded with traditional patriotic songs, providing a celebratory climax to the season.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists, including NASA researchers, has identified significant shortcomings in the U.S. space agency's capabilities for long-term lunar habitation, warning that these gaps put American competitiveness at risk. The report, published in the journal npj Microgravity, points to past funding cuts and policy decisions that have hindered research into bioregenerative life support systems. This assessment comes as China and Russia collaborate on establishing their own lunar research base, highlighting an urgent need for NASA to develop the critical technologies required for a sustainable presence on the moon.</p>

Despite a strong batting performance from Hampshire, including 85 runs from Toby Albert, Somerset secured victory with an over to spare.

          <p>Congressional Democrats are establishing healthcare as a non-negotiable issue in the ongoing government funding talks, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. Democratic leaders have stated they will oppose any Republican spending bill that does not extend Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are set to expire and could cause premiums to rise significantly. The party is also demanding the reversal of recent cuts to Medicaid, creating a contentious standoff with Republicans ahead of the September 30 funding deadline.

The move is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, a change praised by the UN Refugee Agency as a potential "regional benchmark." The decision may also help address labor shortages in Thailand following the recent departure of many Cambodian migrant workers.</p>

          <p>The issue of Ukrainian children forcibly relocated to Russia remains a significant point of contention in the ongoing conflict, with Ukraine demanding their return as a condition for peace talks. While Ukraine's official list contains nearly 20,000 names, the exact number is disputed, and Russia denies any abductions, claiming it "rescued" the children. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and his children's rights commissioner for the unlawful deportation. Despite international pressure, the process of repatriation is slow, with organizations like Save Ukraine helping return only 60 to 70 children per month to their relatives.</p>

          <p>Russia and its ally Belarus have begun their quadrennial joint military exercise, known as "Zapad" (West), amid heightened tensions with neighboring NATO countries. The drills, taking place primarily in Belarus near the borders of Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, simulate repelling enemy attacks and include preparations for the use of nuclear-capable missiles. The exercise is causing concern among NATO members, as the 2021 Zapad drills served as a precursor to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In response, Poland has closed its border with Belarus and launched its own military exercises, "Iron Defender."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stern ultimatum to NATO allies, stating that the U.S. will only impose "major" sanctions on Russia if all member nations cease purchasing Russian oil and agree to similar punitive measures. In a letter, he also urged the alliance to collectively place 50% to 100% tariffs on China, which he claimed would help end the war in Ukraine quickly. This demand represents a significant escalation in pressure on allies, particularly those like Turkey that still import Russian oil, and complicates the diplomatic landscape surrounding the conflict.

While condemning the act, Rubio stated that it is still unclear whether Russia deliberately targeted Poland, a NATO member. The incident, which prompted Poland to shoot down the drones, marked the first time a NATO country has fired on Russian targets during the Ukraine war. Following the violation, NATO announced plans to strengthen its eastern flank, and Poland has rejected suggestions from President Trump that the incursion could have been a mistake.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers and advocates are raising alarms that approximately 1,000 unaccompanied children from Central America, including dozens in California, are at risk of being deported before their court cases are complete. This concern follows a near-deportation of 76 Guatemalan children over Labor Day weekend, which was halted by a federal judge's emergency order. Advocates believe the government is now expanding this effort to include children from Honduras and El Salvador, as some of their court hearings have recently disappeared from official calendars. They argue that these removals violate the children's rights and return them to dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>The arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson for the killing of Charlie Kirk has intensified the political debate surrounding the event, with questions about the shooter's motivations remaining unanswered. While authorities have not declared an official motive, Utah's governor stated the suspect was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," fueling partisan narratives. The article explores the varied reactions from conservative figures, some of whom have softened their rhetoric towards the individual suspect while continuing to blame broader liberal ideology. This situation highlights the deep divisions in American political discourse and the immediate rush to frame acts of violence within existing political conflicts.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" analyzed the immediate social media reactions and what they reveal about the state of American political discourse. Panelists observed a familiar pattern where acts of political violence prompt calls for de-escalation and unity from both sides, yet these sentiments often fail to create lasting change. The discussion highlighted a cycle of regret and finger-pointing that quickly follows such tragedies. The conversation suggests that while there is an initial impulse to pull back from extreme rhetoric, it is rarely sustained in the highly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office specifically questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US, the BBC understands. The questions were reportedly sent after initial vetting flagged the relationship, but his answers were deemed sufficient at the time. Mandelson was dismissed this week after newly surfaced emails showed him sending supportive messages to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. The revelation raises further questions about the prime minister's judgment and the thoroughness of the vetting processes that failed to uncover these emails.</p>
