          <p>Thames Water's future is in jeopardy after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest Â£4bn into the company. The company, serving a quarter of the UK population, called the news "disappointing" and stated it would work on an alternative plan to avoid government administration. Sources close to the situation cited the politicization of the water industry as a major disincentive for investors. Thames Water has accumulated significant debt since privatization in 1989 and faces regulatory challenges, with an independent review calling the current system "chaotic."</p>

The FBI encourages reporting of any hospitals, clinics, or practitioners performing these surgical procedures on children. This initiative follows President Trump's executive order aimed at protecting children from chemical and surgical procedures.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge is facing criticism for being classified as an England and Wales project, despite having no tracks laid in Wales. This classification means Wales will not receive additional funding through the Barnett Formula, leading to accusations of unfairness. Welsh politicians argue that Wales is being denied significant funding that could transform its own rail network, with some comparing the situation to the HS2 controversy. The UK government maintains that the project is funded through its rail network enhancements pipeline, which benefits both England and Wales.</p>

          <p>Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down a lucrative offer from Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal. The offer would have more than doubled his current salary, but Fernandes decided to remain with Manchester United after discussing the matter with his family. United is reportedly pleased with the decision, especially after head coach Ruben Amorim expressed confidence in Fernandes staying at Old Trafford. Al-Hilal was prepared to offer a substantial sum for the 30-year-old midfielder, who has made 290 appearances for United since joining in 2020.</p>

          <p>The US State Department is implementing performance metrics for American ambassadors in Africa, evaluating them based on the number of business deals they secure. This shift reflects the US government's new "trade, not aid" approach to the continent. The Trump administration has secured multiple deals worth billions of dollars in Africa within its first 100 days. This strategy contrasts with previous approaches, including overhauling USAID, suspending foreign aid, and imposing trade tariffs, as well as dismantling the Millennium Challenge Corporation.</p>

          <p>A key rule for understanding the second Trump administration is recognizing that a lot happens, but a lot also un-happens. This pattern of policy announcements followed by reversals and legal challenges creates uncertainty for businesses and investors. The article highlights examples in trade, foreign policy, and immigration, where the administration's actions have been inconsistent and subject to change. While this slipperiness can be a political strength, it undermines the stability needed for long-term economic investment.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores whether the decline of deep reading is negatively impacting political discourse and engagement. The article draws on the work of Walter Ong to compare modern digital communication with pre-literate oral cultures. It questions whether the shift away from deep literacy is contributing to a decline in abstract thought, rational debate, and commitment to liberal democracy. However, it also cautions against overstating the social harms of cultural marginalization and notes that some empirical research challenges the direct link between literacy and abstract thought.</p>

The flawed list, which was removed from the Homeland Security website, has drawn criticism and mockery from politicians.

A low-pressure system is expected to bring a chance of thunderstorms, particularly in the mountains and Antelope Valley, with potential for downburst winds and dry lightning. Coastal areas are under a beach hazard advisory due to elevated surf and rip currents. Authorities are also entering fire weather high-season operations, urging residents to prepare for potential wildfires.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search in Portugal for Madeleine McCann, nearly two decades after her disappearance. The search is focused on the municipality of Lagos, near Praia da Luz, and is expected to continue until Friday. German investigators, who identified Christian BrÃ¼ckner as their prime suspect in 2020, are leading the case. BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a sentence for a separate crime, and authorities fear he will disappear after his release if not charged in the McCann case.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated that many market participants view continued reductions in government bond purchases as appropriate, signaling a move towards policy normalization. Ueda noted limited calls to revise the current reduction plan through March 2026 during a mid-May meeting with market participants. The BOJ plans to discuss the purchase reduction at its next policy meeting, aiming to gradually shrink its balance sheet. Ueda also mentioned the BOJ's cautious stance on raising policy rates due to uncertainties from U.S. tariffs.</p>

The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to 1.6% for this year and 1.5% for 2026, due to tariff fallout, policy uncertainty, and a slowdown in net immigration. The OECD also lowered its global growth forecast, noting that the slowdown is concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

          <p>Scientists in the U.S. are expressing concerns about the future of science under the Trump administration due to budget cuts and immigration restrictions. As the United States reduces funding and limits immigration, China and Europe are offering researchers money and stability. This shift raises fears that the U.S. is losing its position as a global leader in scientific research and innovation.</p>

          <p>A guest essay analyzes the increasing U.S. debt pile and its implications for the economy and markets. The author notes the rising Republican deficits, the refusal to consider revenue-raising measures, and the administration's communication strategy. The concern is shifting to the $29 trillion market for U.S. Treasuries, where macroeconomics and politics intersect. The piece also touches on the potential for a tax on foreign capital inflows, and the downgrade of U.S. Treasuries from Moody's. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michael Boren, nominated by President Trump to lead the Forest Service, is facing scrutiny over past actions. Boren is accused of threatening trail workers with a helicopter, building an airstrip without a permit, and placing a cabin on federal property. These allegations raise questions about his suitability for leading the Forest Service and his commitment to environmental protection.</p>
