          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests following ICE operations, with President Trump citing the inability of California's governor and Los Angeles's mayor to manage the situation. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, asserting that local authorities can handle the situation. The deployment involves 2,000 National Guard troops under Title 10 authority, which allows the president to use the military for law enforcement in specific cases, bypassing the Posse Comitatus Act. The events follow ICE raids in Los Angeles, leading to arrests and widespread demonstrations.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men’s participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China.

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may be an eating disorder in disguise. Intermittent fasting, where people consume calories on a 16:8 plan or other variations, is touted for its benefits, but experts say it could lead down a slippery slope for those affected by disordered eating. Registered dietitian nutritionist Becky Mehr explains that intermittent fasting can serve as a socially acceptable disguise for disordered eating behaviors. Dr. Anne Marie O’Melia warns that any form of caloric restriction or adherence to rigid food rules significantly increases the risk of developing eating disorders.</p>

          <p>Japan is not doing enough to avoid "toilet panic" in disasters, despite its reputation for disaster preparedness. The Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024 highlighted the dire state of public restrooms and the lack of knowledge about portable toilets. Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets in times of disaster to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Educational efforts are underway to teach children how to use portable toilets and encourage families to stockpile them.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to embrace China's '996' work culture, citing concerns about overwork and its impact on employee wellbeing. Venture capitalists sparked debate by suggesting European startups need to adopt a more intense work ethic to compete globally. However, many founders argue that overwork is counterproductive and that Europe needs more funding and resources, not longer hours. They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures and work-life balance.</p>
