        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.9% in July, significantly surpassing expectations and marking the largest monthly increase since June 2022, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Core PPI, excluding food and energy, also saw a substantial rise, indicating potential inflationary pressures within the U.S. economy. This unexpected surge in wholesale prices led to a decline in stock market futures and an increase in shorter-duration Treasury yields, suggesting investor concerns about the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. While PPI is considered an important indicator of pipeline prices, escalating questions regarding BLS data accuracy have emerged due to budget cuts and changes in data collection methods, potentially influencing market interpretations and economic policy decisions.

          <p>Richard Kim, a former executive at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, has been indicted on securities and wire fraud charges for allegedly misappropriating approximately $4 million in investor funds for his online casino company, Zero Edge. Kim reportedly lost most of the funds through gambling on another site, Shuffle, and concealed his actions from investors, falsely claiming the losses were due to a "treasury management strategy." Galaxy Digital, where Kim previously worked, was among the investors who lost money in the scheme. Kim admitted to the FBI that his actions were wrong and unjustifiable, and he now faces legal proceedings after failing to reach a resolution with prosecutors. The optimism score is 10.</p>

          <p>A trial concluded regarding President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, with arguments focusing on the Posse Comitatus Act and the limits of presidential authority. California sued, seeking to limit the military's role in immigration enforcement, arguing it was an unlawful military crusade, while the Justice Department defended the deployment as protection of federal property. The judge questioned the scope of presidential power and the relevance of the Posse Comitatus Act, expressing concern over the potential for a national police force. A ruling is pending, with the case raising questions about the balance of federal and state power. The optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>President Trump intends to seek congressional approval for "long-term" control of Washington DC's police department, invoking a clause that allows a 30-day federal takeover. He also signaled plans for other US cities to change their laws in response to his deployment of national guard troops and federal agents. The administration argues this is necessary to combat what Trump calls an "out of control" crime problem, which city leaders dispute.

          <p>President Trump's portrayal of Washington, D.C., as overrun by crime contrasts with federal data showing violent crime is at a three-decade low. While the city experienced a crime spike in 2023, that trend has since reversed, according to the Justice Department. However, a Washington Post poll revealed that many residents still perceive crime as a serious problem. Experts suggest the gap between perception and reality stems from how crime makes people feel.
