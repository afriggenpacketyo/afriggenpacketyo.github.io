          <p>Cassie Ventura's trial against Sean Combs continues with cross-examination focusing on text messages between the two. The defense is attempting to show Ventura had more agency in their relationship than she previously claimed. Ventura acknowledged that she told Combs she loved when they made love after "freak off" sessions, and that she understood his career could be ruined when her lawsuit was publicized. She also admitted to dreaming of a beautiful future with Combs early in their relationship, based on messages from 2007 which she described as reading like a journal entry in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship and limit the scope of nationwide injunctions. The justices questioned the legality and practicality of Trump's order, with some expressing concern about the potential for unlawful executive orders to remain in effect for extended periods. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that nationwide injunctions create an unfair legal playing field for the government and encourage forum shopping, while Justice Sotomayor countered that the order violates Supreme Court precedent. The court also debated whether limiting nationwide injunctions would create a "Catch Me If You Can" system of justice.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that passenger complaints against U.S. airlines reached a record high in 2024, with a 9% increase in complaints outpacing a 4% rise in passenger volume. The surge is attributed to widespread cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage, despite new regulations requiring automatic refunds for significant flight disruptions. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints, while Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian Airlines performed best in terms of overall customer satisfaction. The report also highlighted nationwide air traffic controller shortages that could lead to more schedule disruptions in 2025.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration initiative to arrest undocumented migrants for trespassing on a newly declared ‚Äúnational defense‚Äù zone along New Mexico‚Äôs border with Mexico is facing legal challenges. A federal judge dismissed charges against nearly 100 migrants, citing a lack of evidence that they knew they were entering a restricted military area. Defense lawyers argue that some migrants were arrested before warning signs were posted or were unable to read them. The situation has caused confusion and concern among residents, volunteers, and recreational users of the public lands now under military jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Three major wildfires continue to burn out of control in northeastern Minnesota, exacerbated by near-critical fire weather conditions. The fires, including the Jenkins Creek Fire, Camp House Road Fire, and Munger Shaw Fire, have collectively consumed over 32,000 acres. The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed numerous structures, leading to evacuations and emergency relief efforts. The Eastern Area Complex Incident Team has taken command of the Jenkins Creek and Camp House fires, managing them as the "Brimson Complex," as crews also battle massive wildfires just north of Minnesota in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces.</p>

          <p>House Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin, are investigating President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million private jet from the Qatari government. They're seeking a legal memo, reportedly drafted by Attorney General Pam Bondi, justifying the acceptance of the plane. Democrats argue that accepting the gift without congressional approval violates the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. They suggest the gift may be a bribe, given Trump's comments about delays in the delivery of his new Air Force One and the plane's eventual donation to his presidential library.</p>

Analysts have also warned of potential inventory shortfalls due to tariff-induced supply chain issues.

He has never been charged in the McCann case and denies any involvement in her disappearance in 2007.

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling 273,789 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition vehicles due to a poorly installed front brake line that may lead to reduced brake function. Affected vehicles may have "a bent brake line" that could come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, which could result in a brake fluid leak, potentially increasing the risk of a crash. Ford is not aware of any reports of any accidents or injuries as a result of the faulty brake line. The recall affects 2022-2024 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition models.</p>
