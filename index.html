            <p>A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following a house explosion in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, that resulted in the death of 53-year-old David Howard. Emergency services responded to the scene on John Street, where one terraced house was destroyed and two others partially collapsed. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, and authorities are urging the public to avoid speculation while they work to determine the circumstances surrounding the tragic event. Approximately 50 people were evacuated from their homes, and a clear-up operation is underway to remove debris and assess the damage to surrounding properties.</p>

            <p>Hamas has reportedly rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza that included a demand for the group to disarm. According to a Palestinian official familiar with the talks, Hamas views the proposal as lacking commitment to ending the war or withdrawing Israeli troops, which are key conditions for releasing hostages. The rejection comes amid continued Israeli military operations in Gaza, including an airstrike on a field hospital in Khan Younis. The UN has warned of a worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza due to restrictions on the entry of supplies, a claim refuted by Israel.</p>

CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted the resilience of consumers and the strong performance of business clients as contributing factors.

            <p>A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that the U.S. would be unable to fill a potential shortfall of rare earth elements if China imposes export controls, posing a threat to Washington's military capabilities. China holds a virtual monopoly over global heavy rare earths processing, which are crucial for advanced defense technologies. The report highlights the U.S.'s vulnerability in these supply chains and the need for a long-term effort to develop domestic mining and processing capabilities. The Department of Defense has set a goal to develop a complete rare earth element supply chain by 2027.</p>

            <p>Apple's suppliers in India, Foxconn and Tata, reportedly shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the United States in March, a record high, to circumvent potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company ramped up production in India and chartered cargo flights to transport the devices, ensuring sufficient inventory in one of its largest markets. The move followed the imposition of 26% duties on imports from India, although those tariffs were later paused for most countries except China. The initiative highlights Apple's efforts to mitigate the impact of trade tensions on its supply chain.</p>

While China hopes to stimulate domestic spending to make up for export losses, many Chinese consumers are hesitant to spend due to falling house prices.</p>
