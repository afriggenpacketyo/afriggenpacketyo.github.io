          <p>The White House has begun demolishing its East Wing to construct a new, privately funded ballroom, a project President Trump says will be paid for by donors and himself. This move has drawn public attention, especially after images revealed the extent of the demolition, contradicting earlier statements that the existing structure would not be touched. Corporate donors, including Alphabet and Lockheed Martin, are reportedly contributing millions to the estimated $250 million project. The construction is being managed by Clark Construction with design by McCrery Architects, marking a significant and controversial architectural change to the historic executive residence.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers may face higher turkey prices this Thanksgiving, as wholesale costs have soared by 40% compared to last year, reaching an estimated $1.32 per pound. The price hike is primarily driven by a reduced supply of turkeys, a consequence of avian flu outbreaks and a decade-long decline in the number of birds raised by farmers. In response, major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering competitive deals on turkeys, often using them as "loss leaders" to attract shoppers for other holiday groceries. Despite the wholesale surge, food economists suggest that the increase in consumer prices will likely be more moderate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American missionary, who has worked in Niger for over a decade, was kidnapped from his home in Niamey by three armed assailants. The abduction occurred in a highly secured district, merely yards from the presidential palace where the nation's ousted president is being held. The U.S. Embassy has issued a heightened security alert for its citizens, citing an increased risk of kidnapping throughout the capital. While no group has claimed responsibility, regional security officials speculate that an ISIS affiliate, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, may be involved, as the victim's phone was tracked to an area they control.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported its third-quarter financial results, revealing mixed performance that has captured the attention of investors and market analysts. The electric vehicle manufacturer posted adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share, falling short of the 54 cents per share anticipated by analysts polled by LSEG. However, the company surpassed revenue expectations, bringing in $28.10 billion against a forecast of $26.37 billion. This divergence between earnings and revenue presents a complex picture of the company's profitability and operational efficiency during the period, prompting discussions about its future financial trajectory.

          <p>The director of the Louvre Museum, Laurence des Cars, has publicly admitted that significant security failures allowed thieves to steal €88 million worth of French crown jewels. Speaking to French senators, she described the museum's perimeter CCTV system as "aging" and "very unsatisfactory," noting that the only camera monitoring the thieves' entry point was pointed in the wrong direction. This lapse enabled the gang to access the Gallery of Apollo undetected and complete the heist in under ten minutes. Des Cars acknowledged the museum had been "defeated" by the criminals and highlighted the urgent need for security investment to protect its priceless collections.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are sharply criticizing a non-binding ruling from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that obligates Israel to cooperate with the UN agency UNRWA. Critics argue the decision ignores substantial evidence of the agency's infiltration by Hamas, an issue that led the U.S. to cease its funding. Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at George Mason University, warned that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent that could compel the U.S. to work with organizations it boycotts. Israel's Foreign Ministry has categorically rejected the opinion, labeling it a political maneuver disguised as international law that overlooks UNRWA's documented involvement in terrorist activities.</p>

          <p>New port fees from the Trump administration have unexpectedly hit U.S.-based shipper Atlantic Container Line (ACL) with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill. The issue stems from a reclassification of the company's hybrid roll-on/roll-off container vessels, which now face fees based on tonnage rather than cargo type. ACL's CEO warns that this unforeseen financial burden could make their U.S. operations unviable, potentially disrupting supply chains for American manufacturers who rely on their unique services. The U.S. Trade Representative has indicated the classification is based on vessel construction and is unlikely to change. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit pertains to a Wall Street Journal report about a risqué letter allegedly sent by Trump to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday. The dinner, attended by Murdoch's wife and key executives from his media companies, highlights the complex and often cozy relationship between Trump and Murdoch's conservative media empire. Just days after the dinner, Trump's legal team filed a vigorous response to a motion from Murdoch's lawyers to have the defamation case dismissed.</p>

          <p>The ongoing demolition of the White House's East Wing for a new $250 million ballroom is being interpreted by critics as a potent metaphor for Donald Trump's presidency. This article suggests that the act of literally taking a wrecking ball to the historic structure reflects his broader approach of dismantling political norms and institutions. The project, which Trump says is privately funded, is seen by some as treating a public asset like private property. While the White House has defended the renovation by citing historical precedents of presidential additions, critics like David Frum argue it symbolizes a shift in Trump's focus from policy to his past career as a real estate developer.</p>

A majority of voters supporting the proposition view it as a way to push back against the Trump administration, which many Californians feel treats their state unfairly. Conversely, those opposing Prop 50 tend to see it as a state-level issue, worrying it will shift power to urban areas and be costly.

          <p>According to jewelry experts, the criminals who stole priceless treasures from the Louvre will likely struggle to profit from their heist. While the French government valued the intact pieces at over $100 million, their worth could plummet by as much as 90% if the gems are removed from their settings to be sold on the black market. Master jeweler Stephen Portier explains that the market for fine jewelry is a small, interconnected network, and dealers worldwide will be on alert for these specific items. The unique characteristics, or "DNA," of each stone and the distinctive old-fashioned cut of the diamonds would make them easily identifiable, even if altered.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acclaimed documentarian Ken Burns explores the multifaceted nature of the American Revolution, coinciding with his new film on the subject. He argues against simplistic, binary interpretations, suggesting the event was simultaneously a triumphant fight for liberty and a tragic civil war that victimized Indigenous and enslaved populations. Burns emphasizes that a nuanced understanding, which acknowledges figures like George Washington as both heroic and flawed, ultimately enlarges the power of the Revolution's core ideas. He contends that embracing this complexity is essential for understanding America's origins and its ongoing identity struggles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, in a joint letter with Qatar, is demanding that the European Union roll back new climate and human rights regulations that could hinder imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The letter warns that the EU's directive, which requires exporters to demonstrate sustainability and human rights protections, poses an "existential threat" to European economies. This move aligns with the administration's broader agenda to boost fossil fuel use globally. The pressure comes as the U.S. Department of Energy approved the controversial CP2 LNG export terminal in Louisiana, a massive project that critics say will raise domestic energy prices and exacerbate the climate crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates again in October and December, potential homebuyers are weighing whether to lock in current mortgage rates or wait for them to fall further. Locking a rate now, around 6.3%, provides certainty and protects against unexpected market spikes, allowing for confident budgeting. However, waiting could lead to additional savings if the Fed's actions push rates lower, though there's no guarantee this will occur or that lenders haven't already priced in the cuts. Homebuyers should also consider potential "float down" fees from lenders if they lock a rate and then wish to secure a lower one later. (not investment advice)</p>

The precious metal is now down more than 6% from the record intraday high it reached on Monday. According to analysts at UBS, the pullback is not driven by macroeconomic factors but is largely a technical correction as speculative investors take profits following a prolonged rally. Despite the decline, the bank believes the fundamental drivers for gold, including inflation and political instability, remain strong, suggesting it is premature to turn negative on the metal.

          <p>Nia DaCosta's new film adaptation of "Hedda Gabler," titled "Hedda," offers a sharp and rollicking modern take on the classic play, with a marvelous lead performance by Tessa Thompson. The film reimagines the story within a single, debaucherous 1950s party, tightening the narrative and amplifying its rage against the societal constraints placed on women. Thompson portrays Hedda as a clever, viciously bored newlywed who channels her frustrated ambitions into manipulating those around her. The adaptation boldly layers in themes of race and sexuality, creating a vibrant and compelling psychological drama that feels both timeless and fiercely contemporary.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, it is crucial to understand how the process works for couples. Ideally, both spouses should be listed as co-borrowers, which requires both to be at least 62 years old and meet other eligibility criteria. This ensures that the surviving spouse can remain in the home if one passes away. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which can result in access to less equity than if calculated for an older, single borrower. Couples must carefully weigh these factors and undergo mandatory counseling to ensure the loan aligns with their long-term financial plan.</p>
