          <p>An inquest into the death of Paloma Shemirani, who rejected chemotherapy for cancer in favor of alternative treatments, has highlighted the dangers of parental influence rooted in conspiracy theories. The coroner ruled that Paloma was "highly influenced" by her mother, a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, and that this influence contributed to her death. The case raises broader legal and ethical questions about when authorities should intervene to protect children, including adult children, from harmful misinformation spread by their parents, especially concerning medical decisions. This situation is part of a larger trend of rising medical disinformation, which has led to decreased vaccination rates and other public health concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has invited nine prominent U.S. universities to sign a "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," which would grant them priority access to federal funding. To qualify, the institutions must agree to several conditions, including freezing tuition for five years, capping international student enrollment, and abolishing departments perceived as hostile to conservative ideas. This move represents a significant effort to influence higher education policy, tying financial incentives to ideological alignment. The proposal has already drawn criticism, with the University of Pennsylvania's faculty association describing it as a threat to the university's mission and self-determination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, this time from drugmaker Evita Solutions. This regulatory decision, which increases the number of low-cost options available, was met with immediate criticism from anti-abortion groups and conservative politicians. The approval comes as top health officials in the Trump administration face pressure to reevaluate the drug's safety, despite it being deemed safe and effective for 25 years. Pro-choice advocates argue the approval is a routine process that has been politicized, while opponents call the decision reckless and unconscionable.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that American pessimism regarding the U.S. economy and job market is deepening, a negative trend that has persisted for years. A majority of respondents report that prices for goods and services are still rising, which continues to be the primary factor shaping their negative economic outlook. The survey also reveals significant public concern about the impact of artificial intelligence, with most Americans believing AI will have a net-negative effect on job availability in their fields over the next decade. While currently employed individuals feel secure, most believe finding a new, desirable job would be difficult.</p>

          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth experienced a significant jump in after-hours trading following comments from CEO Barbara Humpton confirming the company is in "close communication" with the Trump administration. This development comes after the administration has recently taken equity stakes in other critical mineral companies like Lithium Americas and MP Materials. The investments are part of a broader government strategy to bolster the domestic rare earth supply chain and reduce U.S. dependence on China for these essential materials. The company is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A low-speed collision occurred between two Delta Air Lines planes on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport, resulting in minor damage and one minor injury to a flight attendant. The incident involved an arriving flight from Charlotte and a departing flight to Roanoke, when the wing of one aircraft made contact with the fuselage of the other. The Federal Aviation Administration stated that air traffic control had instructed one plane to hold its position and yield. The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the collision and has recovered the flight recorders from both aircraft for analysis.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's tenure reveals a leadership style described as chaotic and fixated on public image rather than substantive policy. The article points to an unusual recent gathering where President Trump suggested using U.S. cities as military training grounds, followed by a meandering speech from Hegseth. Sources suggest Hegseth's appointment was based on his television persona and that his leadership has been marked by high turnover, leak investigations, and a growing paranoia within his inner circle. This has allegedly led the department to become a mere mechanism for implementing executive orders rather than a hub for creative strategy.</p>

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study reveals that a growing number of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, making it increasingly difficult to save for retirement. The report found that 42% of younger workers have no spare savings after covering essential expenses, a significant increase from 31% in 1997. This financial strain is attributed to the rising costs of housing and healthcare, which consume a larger portion of income than in previous decades. The findings highlight the inadequacy of the current 401(k)-based retirement system, which places the savings burden primarily on individual workers facing mounting financial pressures.

He was subsequently shot and killed by police at the scene, and three people have since been arrested in connection with the investigation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack and praised the synagogue's security and rabbi for preventing further casualties.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic explores the history of university rankings, tracing their evolution from controversial, informal lists in the early 20th century to the influential cultural force they are today. Early attempts, like a 1911 federal report, were suppressed after causing outrage among unranked institutions. By the 1980s, as college became a mass-consumer good, publications like U.S. News & World Report capitalized on institutional anxiety and consumer demand to create a rankings juggernaut. The article notes how these lists have shaped public perception and the American meritocracy, reflecting and sometimes reinforcing societal biases over objective measures of educational quality.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Economy Is Restructuring, Not Collapsing, Thanks to New Entrepreneurs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that viewing China's economy solely through a lens of stagnation misses a profound transformation driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Unlike their predecessors, this cohort of business leaders, born in the 1960s to 1980s, is technically trained and focused on innovation and co-creation. These entrepreneurs, often from business-centric provinces like Zhejiang and Guangdong, are blending their experience of past scarcity with modern market opportunities. This dynamic is fostering a competitive restructuring of the economy, suggesting resilience and continued integration into global systems rather than an impending collapse.</p>

          <p>A team of divers from a shipwreck salvage company has discovered over 1,000 gold and silver coins worth an estimated $1 million off the coast of Florida. The treasure is from a Spanish fleet that was wrecked by a hurricane in 1715 while transporting the fortune back to Spain. The coins, believed to have been minted in Spanish colonies in present-day Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru, are remarkably well-preserved, with some still showing visible dates and mint marks. The find is considered extraordinary, offering a tangible link to the history of the Spanish empire's golden age.</p>

          <p>Paramore lead singer Hayley Williams has confirmed that a lyric in her song “Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party” refers to country star Morgan Wallen. In the song, she sings about being at a "racist country singer's bar," and in a recent interview, she stated, "I’m always talking about Morgan Wallen." The comment alludes to a 2021 incident where Wallen was caught on video using a racial slur, as well as his Nashville bar, which opened last year. Williams, who grew up in Tennessee, has been increasingly vocal about racial issues and religious hypocrisy in her recent music.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, conservation groups are urging the public to stay away from national parks due to safety and preservation concerns. With more than half of the National Park Service workforce on furlough, skeleton staffing leaves parks with limited facilities and emergency services, putting visitors and natural resources at risk. The National Parks Conservation Association warned that visitors would be "probably on your own." This situation echoes the 2018 shutdown, which resulted in widespread vandalism, littering, and damage to protected landscapes and historical sites due to the lack of federal oversight.</p>

          <p>A feature essay delves into the history and spiritual practices of Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean religion developed by enslaved West Africans in Cuba as an act of survival and resistance. The article aims to demystify the tradition, explaining that it emphasizes balance, character, and connection to deities called orishas, which are tied to nature. Scholars argue that the religion is often misunderstood and demonized as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black prejudice, while its core tenets focus on healing and community well-being. The piece addresses and contextualizes controversial aspects like animal sacrifice, framing them within a system of holistic spiritual health.</p>

According to reports, Arrington declined a request to remove an original sword from the library's collection to be presented to the King during President Trump's UK visit, explaining that it was a donated artifact. Despite offering a replica, which was ultimately gifted, administration officials were reportedly unhappy with his refusal. Arrington stated he was told to either resign or be fired, believing he was no longer trusted with confidential information.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has called on his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, citing a controversy surrounding the animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park." The show, which was canceled in 2023, featured a transgender character and has been the subject of conservative backlash. Musk's posts on his X platform accused Netflix of promoting a "transgender woke agenda" and responded to criticism of the show's creator. Despite the high-profile call for a boycott, analysts suggest it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Netflix's large subscriber base or financial performance, viewing it as a fleeting social media controversy.</p>
