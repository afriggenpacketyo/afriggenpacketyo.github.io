          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been found guilty of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass and her colleague Katie Breathwick over a four-year period. The man, diagnosed with schizophrenia, sent numerous disturbing items to their workplace, including an air pistol, handcuffs, and a will-writing kit, causing what Klass described as "sheer terror." The court heard evidence of the significant distress caused to both women, with the defendant's sentencing scheduled for next month.</p>

Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, argued that Norris remains a danger to the public and should not be released, highlighting his lack of full accountability and remorse.</p>

          <p>Due to the government shutdown halting the release of official jobs data, investment firm Carlyle provided its own analysis, indicating minimal employment growth in September. The firm's proprietary data showed a gain of just 17,000 jobs, aligning with other private-sector reports that suggest a significant hiring slowdown. Despite the weak employment figures, Carlyle's data also pointed to some economic resilience, with underlying GDP growth at a 2.7% annualized pace and a rise in business investment.

Gaza's healthcare system has nearly collapsed, and acute malnutrition is rampant, particularly among children, while dozens of Israeli hostages are still believed to be held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>Recent drone sightings that suspended flights at Munich Airport have sparked a debate within the German government over who holds responsibility for defending critical infrastructure. A key point of contention is whether drone defense should be managed by federal authorities or individual states, with constitutional limits preventing the German military from intervening in domestic airspace. The incidents highlight a significant gap in Germany's internal security framework, as police forces lack the necessary equipment to counter aerial threats effectively.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Tim Kaine has defended Virginia Attorney General candidate Jay Jones, stating he remains a supporter despite the emergence of disturbing text messages from Jones. In the texts, Jones envisioned the murder of a top state Republican, Todd Gilbert, and made disparaging remarks about Gilbert's family. While Kaine called the comments "indefensible," he noted Jones's apology and expressed his belief that the statements were out of character for the candidate he has known for 25 years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge to a Colorado law that prohibits licensed counselors from practicing "conversion therapy" on minors, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The case was brought by a Christian counselor who argues the ban infringes on her free speech rights by censoring conversations with young patients who seek to align their identity with their biological sex.

          <p>Despite the government shutdown forcing hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, members of Congress will continue to receive their salaries. This is because congressional pay is funded by a permanent appropriation established in 1983 and is protected under the Constitution, meaning it does not require annual renewal. The president's salary is also constitutionally protected, but many White House staffers and most other federal employees will see their paychecks delayed until a funding agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown will not interrupt the distribution of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) checks, as these benefits are covered by mandatory, pre-approved spending. However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has warned that other services could be impacted due to a reduced operating budget and furloughed employees. Services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards may be halted or delayed until the government reopens.</p>

          <p>Ghana is facing a critical healthcare challenge due to the high demand for organ transplants, particularly for kidneys and corneas, and the absence of a legal framework to regulate donations. The cost of a kidney transplant can be around $50,000, and there is a severe shortage of surgeons, forcing many Ghanaians to seek expensive and risky treatment abroad. A proposed Organ and Tissue Donation Bill, which would establish a regulatory authority and a national registry, is pending in parliament and aims to make procedures safer and more affordable for citizens.</p>

          <p>When choosing between traditional (pretax) and Roth 401(k) contributions, many people mistakenly compare their current marginal tax rate to their expected future marginal rate. A financial planner suggests a more effective method is to compare one's current marginal rate with their likely *effective* tax rate in retirement, which is often much lower. This calculation, which divides total taxes paid by total income, can provide a more accurate picture and may show that pretax contributions are more advantageous than commonly believed.

If this deadline passes without a deal, however, some fear the shutdown could become even more prolonged.</p>

Jenrick argued this move is necessary to prevent judges who "blur the line between adjudication and activism" from being appointed to the bench.</p>
