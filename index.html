        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Utah defense attorney suggests the prosecution's timeline could be a significant weak spot in the case against Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The expert, Skye Lazaro, notes that the defense will likely scrutinize the timing of Robinson's alleged return to the crime scene and the timestamps of incriminating text messages. With the discovery process just beginning, the defense is expected to prolong proceedings for up to a year to meticulously piece together events and challenge the prosecution's narrative, potentially exploiting any inconsistencies found in the evidence.</p>

          <p>A Thai hitman has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Lim Kimya, a 74-year-old former Cambodian opposition parliamentarian, in Bangkok. Lim Kimya, a member of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was shot and killed in January, an event witnessed by his French wife. The defendant's sentence was commuted from a potential death penalty because he confessed to the crime. Two other Cambodian suspects, including one allegedly linked to the former ruling party, are still being sought in connection with the politically charged assassination.</p>

Using advanced techniques like hormone injections and artificial fertilization, they are breeding thousands of toads in a controlled lab environment. This assisted reproduction program, combined with habitat restoration efforts on private lands, represents the species' best chance for survival after its population declined by over 90% due to habitat loss and invasive species. The project highlights a hopeful, science-driven approach to preserving biodiversity.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues into its third day, the Senate is scheduled to reconvene to vote on two competing stopgap funding measures from both Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have blocked previous Republican-led bills, demanding that any resolution also address their concerns about healthcare subsidies. Meanwhile, the shutdown's effects are beginning to ripple through federal agencies, with the Health and Human Services Secretary confirming the FDA's approval of a generic abortion pill was legally required, even as he pledged a new review of the medication's accessibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair as a key figure in his 20-point plan for postwar Gaza, where Blair would serve on a "Board of Peace." Blair, known for his role in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, has called Trump's plan "bold and intelligent." However, his involvement is controversial due to his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has tainted his reputation internationally. The proposal has received a mixed and skeptical reception, with some Palestinian officials expressing cautious welcome while others, including Hamas, strongly denounce Blair's participation.</p>

          <p>Following a push by President Trump, congressional Republicans have withdrawn all federal funding for public media, a move that is disproportionately harming rural and tribal stations like South Dakota Public Broadcasting. The network has lost nearly a quarter of its budget, forcing it to slash its newsroom from eleven journalists to four and cancel its signature daily public affairs show. This has created an ironic situation where the station, in order to fill airtime, must rely more heavily on national programming from NPR and PBS—the very networks conservatives criticized—because creating local content is more expensive.</p>

          <p>Don Rea Jr., the president of the PGA of America, has issued a formal apology for the "disrespectful" and "inappropriate" behavior of some fans during the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black. The event was marred by profane and personal chants directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy. Rea, who had initially downplayed the vitriol, condemned the behavior in a letter to PGA members, stating it was not representative of the sport. The apology follows widespread criticism of the organization's initial response to the hostile crowd environment during the tournament.</p>

          <p>A district court in Finland has dismissed a case against the captain and two officers of the oil tanker Eagle S, who were accused of damaging undersea power and internet cables in the Baltic Sea. The court ruled that it lacked the jurisdiction to apply Finnish criminal law to the incident, which occurred in December of last year. Prosecutors had alleged the crew intentionally dragged the ship's anchor for 90 kilometers, but the crew maintained they were unaware of any issue. The incident is one of several recent disruptions to Baltic infrastructure, raising concerns about potential sabotage.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning that if the United States supplies long-range missiles, such as Tomahawks, to Ukraine, it would represent a "completely new stage of escalation." Speaking at a forum, Putin stated that using such weapons would be impossible without direct U.S. military involvement, qualitatively changing the conflict. His comments follow reports that the Trump administration is considering providing Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles and the intelligence needed to strike targets deep inside Russia, a significant potential shift in U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether the Nobel Prizes, first awarded in 1901, remain relevant in the contemporary scientific landscape. While the awards are effective at popularizing major scientific achievements and inspiring interest in STEM fields, they also face significant criticism. Critics argue the prizes perpetuate the myth of the lone genius, overlooking the collaborative nature of modern research where thousands of uncredited scientists contribute to discoveries. Furthermore, the awards have been historically biased towards men and researchers from Western institutions in the US and Europe, raising questions about inclusivity and fairness.</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released an updated report promoting a "planetary health diet," which emphasizes varied plant-based foods and significantly less meat and sugar to benefit both human health and the environment. However, the findings are being targeted by what a new investigation calls a "coordinated campaign" of online misinformation, allegedly linked to the meat and dairy industry. This campaign uses social media influencers and industry-friendly scientists to portray the research as dangerous and elitist, a tactic that was also used against the commission's original 2019 report.</p>

Running on a populist platform, he positions himself as an anti-establishment outsider who will run the country like a successful company, despite being a long-standing member of the elite. His political career has been marked by persistent controversies, including allegations of EU subsidy fraud, conflicts of interest, and collaboration with the communist-era secret service.

          <p>A Nigerian man, deported from the United States to Ghana as part of a controversial "third-country deportation" policy, claims he and five other deportees were secretly and illegally transferred to neighboring Togo by Ghanaian officers. He alleges they were told they were being moved to better accommodations but were instead "dumped" across the border without documentation, leaving them stranded. This incident raises further questions about Ghana's agreement with the U.S. to accept deportees from various West African nations, a deal that has already faced criticism from opposition MPs and human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>At the request of the Trump administration, Apple has removed ICEBlock and similar applications from its App Store. These apps allowed users to report and track the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in their communities, often to help undocumented immigrants avoid arrest. The Justice Department argued that the apps endangered law enforcement officers by increasing their risk of being targeted for violence. Apple cited "safety risks" identified by law enforcement as the reason for the removal, which comes amid a broader crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Direct flights between India and China are set to resume by late October, ending a five-year suspension that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. The halt in air travel continued due to prolonged and deadly border tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors in the Himalayas. This move is described by the Indian government as part of a "gradual normalization of relations." The announcement follows Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to China, signaling a potential thaw in the otherwise frosty relationship between the two Asian powers.</p>
