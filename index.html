        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pay review bodies have recommended that ministers provide public sector workers, including teachers and NHS staff, with pay increases of up to 4%, exceeding the government's budgeted 2.8%. This recommendation is likely to strain public finances, potentially leading to tax increases or spending cuts in other areas. The government's decision could spark a new wave of strikes, especially if higher pay is funded through existing budgets and efficiency savings. Prime Minister Starmer has emphasized ending strikes as a key part of improving the NHS and reducing waiting lists, making the situation politically sensitive.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly thanked North Korean forces for their contributions in the conflict in the Kursk region of Ukraine, marking the first official acknowledgment of North Korean involvement. North Korean state media confirmed its troops participated in operations to repel Ukrainian units, lauding their "heroic feats" and "high fighting spirit." Western intelligence estimates suggest that North Korean forces have sustained significant casualties, with thousands killed or wounded.

          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England is urging the government to ban AI applications that generate sexually explicit images of children, citing a disproportionate targeting of girls and young women. Dame Rachel de Souza's report highlights that children are avoiding online engagement to reduce the risk of being targeted by these technologies. The government has stated that creating and distributing such material is illegal and that the Online Safety Act requires platforms to remove this content, but the commissioner believes more needs to be done to protect children from this emerging threat. The government has also announced plans to tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images being generated by AI, which include making it illegal to possess, create, or distribute AI tools designed to create such material.</p>

          <p>Trump Coins, a venture selling commemorative coins, claims that rising gold prices are due to President Trump's economic policies and leadership. However, experts argue that the surge in gold value is a reflection of economic uncertainty caused by Trump's trade policies and anticipated inflation. They note that gold prices typically rise during times of economic turmoil, acting as a safe-haven asset. Despite the marketing claims, experts suggest that investors seeking to capitalize on gold's value should consider ETFs rather than commemorative coins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Lake County, Montana, individuals with mental health crises are often held in small jail cells due to a lack of adequate mental health services and inpatient psychiatric beds. Some individuals wait months for an opening at the Montana State Hospital, leading to deteriorating mental health while incarcerated. This situation exemplifies a nationwide problem, with nearly half of local jail inmates in the U.S. suffering from mental illness. The state is attempting to address the issue through grants for jail-based mental health stabilization services, but advocates emphasize the need for more inpatient beds and community-based services.</p>

These insects, characterized by their red eyes and loud buzzing, appear in 17-year intervals. The brood's emergence is predicted to be concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller pockets along the East Coast. The timing of the emergence is linked to soil temperature, with cicadas exiting the soil when it reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump should regularly meet with small business owners to understand their challenges and needs, as they are often overlooked in favor of larger corporations. Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy, accounting for a significant portion of private sector activity and job creation. The author contends that small businesses have been disproportionately affected by government mandates, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, and that their voices should be heard in policy discussions. The author advocates for less government interference and a level playing field for small businesses to thrive.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that this week is critical for determining the U.S.'s continued involvement in Russia-Ukraine war talks. Donald Trump's administration is assessing whether both sides genuinely desire peace after 90 days of effort. Trump suggested that Zelensky is willing to cede Crimea to Russia, a claim not publicly confirmed by either leader. Germany warned Ukraine against territorial concessions for a ceasefire, adding complexity to negotiations.</p>
