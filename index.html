          <p>An increasing number of couples are choosing to include their dogs in their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral members of the family. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, flower girls, and official greeters, reflecting a cultural shift where pets are seen as providing significant emotional support. To meet this demand, specialized dog chaperone services have emerged, which handle all aspects of the pet's involvement, from transportation to grooming and practicing their role. This trend highlights the deepening bond between humans and their pets, with many owners considering their dogs to be like children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its component suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics, to halt production of its H20 artificial intelligence chips. These chips were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls for the Chinese market. The directive follows reports that the Chinese government has urged local tech companies to stop purchasing the H20 chips due to national security concerns, including the potential for remote-access "backdoors." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged Beijing's security queries and stated the company is in discussions to resolve the issue, hoping to resume shipments under U.S.-approved licenses.</p>

          <p>Court documents from a legal dispute between Elon Musk and OpenAI have revealed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to participate in a $97.4 billion takeover bid for the AI company in early 2025. The proposal was made when Musk, an OpenAI co-founder, became concerned about its transition to a for-profit entity. The filing, part of OpenAI's counter-claims against Musk, states that Zuckerberg and Meta were approached with a letter of intent but ultimately did not sign on to the financing consortium. This disclosure highlights the intense competition and complex relationships among top tech leaders in the race for AI dominance.</p>

          <p>A California parole board has denied the release of Erik Menendez, who was convicted alongside his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents. The panel determined that Menendez, despite claims of acting in self-defense after years of abuse, continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, citing numerous prison rule violations as a primary factor. While family members supported his release, the board stated he must wait three years for his next hearing, urging him to improve his conduct. The decision comes ahead of his brother Lyle's parole hearing.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and his social media company, X, have reached a settlement in principle with former employees who sued for $500 million in unpaid severance. The lawsuit was filed after Musk's 2022 takeover of the platform, then called Twitter, led to the termination of approximately 6,000 workers. The former employees argued they were denied promised severance packages, with some receiving only one month's pay or nothing at all. While details of the agreement have not been made public, the parties have requested a postponement of a court hearing to finalize the terms, potentially closing a significant legal chapter from the tumultuous acquisition.</p>

The family is now working with the International Game Fish Association to certify the catch, which would break the previous junior record of 59 pounds set in 2002.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, registered at 3.1% for July, slightly higher than the 3% forecast by economists but down from the previous month. This marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, fueling debate over the central bank's interest rate policy. The cooling was partly attributed to easing rice prices, which had previously skyrocketed. Despite this, the "core-core" inflation rate, which also excludes energy, held steady at 3.4%, indicating persistent underlying price pressures in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision is a significant victory for a coalition of environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe, who argued the facility's hasty construction violated environmental protection laws.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a highly complex and fractured ruling regarding the Trump administration's cancellation of National Institutes of Health grants, creating significant jurisdictional confusion. The decision effectively allows the administration to proceed with the cuts while forcing plaintiffs into a convoluted legal process split between different courts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a dissent, criticized the ruling as "Calvinball jurisprudence" designed to ensure the administration wins, warning it will make vindicating the rule of law nearly impossible. The practical effect is that crucial public health research into areas like suicide prevention and Alzheimer's disease will likely be lost.</p>

          <p>Families campaigning for an independent inquiry into maternity care at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust have expressed frustration after a meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a national review. The group, who lost babies due to alleged medical errors, felt that the chair was unprepared and that no progress was made on their specific demands for an inquiry led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden. They also criticized the appointment of a former Care Quality Commission inspector to the review team, raising concerns about the investigation's independence. The families stated they feel "ignored, exhausted and dismissed" by the process.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for the online message board 4chan has stated the company will refuse to pay fines proposed by Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, under the new Online Safety Act. The regulator has provisionally decided to impose a £20,000 fine with daily penalties for failing to provide requested information. 4chan's legal team argues that as a U.S. company, it is protected by the First Amendment and that American courts will not enforce foreign censorship codes or penal fines. This standoff represents a significant international challenge to the UK's authority to regulate online content hosted by U.S.-based firms.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that suggest health benefits without scientific backing. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the new recommendations, with the government stating it will consider alternative measures if the industry fails to make sufficient changes.</p>

The visit was intended to highlight the administration's takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department and deployment of the National Guard, which Trump claims has made the city safer.

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite a strong quarterly performance and an upgraded full-year forecast. He described the quarter as exceptionally good for any retailer, noting that the company is successfully growing its top line and expanding margins while absorbing tariff impacts. Simon suggested that investors may have overreacted to a narrow earnings miss caused by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues. He now believes Walmart's value proposition is effectively retaining the high-income shoppers it attracted during the peak of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying. China and Russia are considered leaders in this advanced weapons technology, having invested heavily in their programs for years, while the U.S. and UK are now working to catch up. These weapons pose a significant challenge to existing defense systems because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept. The proliferation of this technology is altering strategic calculations and raising concerns about a new era of geopolitical military competition.</p>
