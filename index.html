          <p>Australians are voting in a general election where the high cost of living and housing shortages are major issues. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party seeks a second term, while Peter Dutton's conservative opposition aims to unseat the first-term government, a feat not achieved since 1931. With early voting already high, the election also highlights changing demographics, as Millennials and Gen Z outnumber Baby Boomers for the first time. Both parties have promised policies to help first-home buyers, but they differ on energy policy, with the opposition favoring nuclear power and Labor focusing on renewables.</p>

          <p>Hall of Fame pitcher Mariano Rivera and his wife, Clara Rivera, have been named as defendants in an amended lawsuit alleging sexual abuse. The original lawsuit, filed in January, accused an older individual of victimizing a young girl during events linked to the church the Riveras co-founded. The amended suit claims the Riveras took inadequate measures to protect the girl and allegedly disregarded her claims of sexual abuse, isolating and intimidating her to remain silent about the incident. The Riveras' attorney denies the allegations, calling them "completely false."</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), a school leaders' union, is launching legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The NAHT is seeking a judicial review of plans for new school report cards, arguing they represent "another crude grading system." This action follows criticism of Ofsted's current inspection methods, particularly after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry. Ofsted defends the proposals, stating they support mental health and that the union's claims are "plainly untenable."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and has permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's attempt to use government power to target lawyers for their representation of disfavored clients. The judge noted the importance of lawyers standing up in court to vindicate constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will reduce its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, approximately 10% of its schedule, after experiencing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby cited air traffic controller staffing shortages and the FAA's technology problems as the cause. Kirby said that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark were absent after technology failures, making it impossible to handle the scheduled number of planes. He is urging the FAA to establish flight restrictions similar to those in place at other congested airports.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has ceased direct shipping of products from China to customers in the United States, now shipping all U.S. orders from local warehouses.

Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices after the policy change. The company states that pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model and actively recruits U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that establishing clear communication channels with agreed-upon negotiators is crucial to easing trade tensions between the US and China. While Chinese officials propose special envoys appointed by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the US prefers direct negotiations between Trump and Xi. The lack of bilateral trust is fueled by disputes over China's role in fentanyl production, leading to tariff increases and a decline in trans-Pacific shipments. China may use fentanyl cooperation as a bargaining chip in future trade negotiations.</p>

          <h2>RFK Jr. Calls for Placebo-Controlled Trials for New Vaccines</h2>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, a policy described as a "radical departure from past practices." This change would necessitate studies comparing vaccine results against a placebo. While placebo-controlled trials are used for new drugs and vaccines, some experts deem it unethical when a safe and efficacious vaccine already exists. The policy's impact on updated vaccines, like those for flu and COVID, remains unclear, but the agency insists it will follow the "Gold Standard of Science."</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming the school "deserves" it. Harvard has responded that there is "no legal basis" for such a move, which would endanger its educational mission and financial aid. While it is unclear if the IRS will proceed with the revocation, federal law prohibits the president from directing the agency to conduct tax investigations. The move is part of a broader pressure campaign against elite universities accused of antisemitism and discrimination.</p>

A federal judge ordered the reinstatement of funds, but an appeals court granted a stay, freezing the order.
