          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise relaxation and health benefits is facing scrutiny from health professionals. Nutritionists express skepticism, suggesting the small amounts of supplements like L-theanine and Lion's Mane are unlikely to produce the advertised effects. An advertising ban against a leading brand for making unproven health claims has highlighted the issue, though some experts note the drinks can be a positive alternative to alcohol. A psychologist suggests the perceived calming effect may stem more from the ritual of taking a mindful break than from the ingredients themselves.</p>

Despite the changing times and the shift to digital news, Akbar continues his work not for financial reasons, but for the joy and independence it brings him while reflecting on the neighborhood's evolution.</p>

          <p>Residents of Pampa Clemesí, a small village in Peru, live without access to the national power grid despite being located next to the country's largest solar complex. The Rubí and Clemesí solar plants can power over 350,000 homes, yet the 150 villagers rely on torches or inadequate personal solar panels. The plant's operator states it has invested in infrastructure to connect the village, but the final government-led step to wire individual homes has stalled. This paradox highlights a system focused on profitability over serving remote populations, leaving residents in a daily struggle for basic necessities.</p>

The event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates unique and unconventionally beautiful dogs, awarding the winner $5,000. Organizers emphasize that the contest demonstrates that a dog's pedigree does not define its value. Many of the contestants are rescue dogs from shelters or puppy mills, highlighting the positive aspects of animal adoption and providing loving homes for pets regardless of their appearance.</p>

Perez Gomez faces charges of patronizing a minor for sexual activity and other child sex crimes. ICE had placed an immigration detainer on him following his initial arrest by Portsmouth Police, but the detainer was not honored, leading to his release. ICE officials located and re-arrested him hours later, stating he posed a "clear threat" to the community and will remain in federal custody pending removal proceedings.</p>

Several allied nations and a group of over 20 countries have issued statements strongly rejecting the plan, warning it will worsen the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that the planned summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield "dead solutions" if it excludes Ukraine. He emphasized that any peace deal must respect Ukraine's non-negotiable territorial integrity and cannot be decided without Kyiv's participation. Zelenskyy's comments address fears that a bilateral meeting could sideline Ukrainian interests, particularly following Trump's suggestion that a deal might involve "swapping of territories." The Ukrainian leader affirmed that his country would not give up its land or reward Russia for its aggression.</p>

          <p>A man in Leicestershire was incorrectly issued a £165 parking charge after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle. The system's photographic evidence showed his Hyundai entering the car park but captured a different car, a Kia with a nearly identical license plate, leaving nine hours later. The driver, Richard Lynn, only became aware of the issue after receiving a letter from solicitors threatening legal action. The parking company stated the issue was rectified once brought to their attention, highlighting a potential flaw in automated enforcement systems that may affect other drivers.</p>

          <p>A recent comment by singer Ed Sheeran, who described himself as "culturally Irish" despite being born and raised in England, has ignited a conversation about identity in 2025. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection to the country where his musical tastes were formed. The debate touches on the complexities of identity beyond citizenship, especially for second-generation immigrants and in post-conflict regions like Northern Ireland. Experts note that identity is evolving and multifaceted, embracing blended traditions and moving beyond historical binaries, a trend reflected across culture from music to literature.</p>

The 54-pound rock, the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023. It was reportedly sold by locals to an international dealer before making its way to an Italian gallery and then to auction. Nigerien officials and heritage advocates argue the export was illegal under laws protecting the nation's natural and cultural heritage, raising questions about illicit international trafficking of significant artifacts.</p>

Critics and film enthusiasts suggest that movies with exceptionally low ratings can be more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. The appeal often lies in earnest efforts that fail spectacularly, revealing the filmmaking process in a charmingly unpolished way. This phenomenon has created cult followings for films like 'The Room' and 'Samurai Cop,' which are celebrated for being so bad they become a unique form of entertainment.</p>

While concerns over data security and links to the Chinese government persist, DeepSeek demonstrated that smarter, more efficient engineering could compete with resource-intensive approaches. This has prompted a shift toward developing smaller, more cost-effective models in the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chief Financial Officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the full-time Town Administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town located 2,000 miles away. Wilton officials claim they were unaware of the dual employment until recently. However, the former CFO, Dawn Norton, asserts that she had kept Wilton's leadership fully informed and was working remotely for the town while on family medical leave. The controversy emerged amid a review of Wilton's Finance Department, which had been struggling with issues attributed to being overworked and understaffed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals upon receiving a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, those with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away and barred from re-entering the UK, with their home country deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this would save taxpayer money, as foreign offenders comprise about 12% of the prison population. Critics, however, warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals, questioning the plan's feasibility.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA on social media for a tribute it posted about a Palestinian footballer that omitted the circumstances of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that Suleiman al-Obeid, a former national team player, was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. UEFA's post on X remembered al-Obeid as a talent who gave hope but did not mention how he died. Salah responded directly, asking UEFA to specify how, where, and why he was killed, bringing wider attention to the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist is highlighting pomegranates as a top fruit for supporting brain health, particularly for individuals over the age of 50. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these nutrients may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein buildup associated with Alzheimer's disease. While fresh pomegranates can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract can be a year-round alternative, though consumers should watch for added sugars. Other beneficial fruits include blueberries, dark grapes, and avocados.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Westminster for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. Protesters intentionally defied the ban by displaying signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action," prompting mass arrests. The government proscribed the group in July, making any support a criminal offense, after activists vandalized military aircraft. While the government defends the ban based on security advice, human rights groups like Amnesty International have called the arrests disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over a request to use confidential taxpayer data to locate undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security had asked the IRS to cross-reference a list of 40,000 names, but the agency declined to share the information it found, citing taxpayer privacy rights. This resistance appears to have conflicted with the administration's goal of using the IRS to aid in its immigration crackdown. The incident highlights growing pressure on federal agencies to align with administration priorities.</p>

Despite a stunning late acceleration and a 100-run partnership with Chris Green, the target proved just out of reach. Spirit's total was built on an unbeaten 70 from opener David Warner, giving them the win and leaving both of Fire's teams winless in the competition.</p>

          <p>Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez has completed a transfer from Liverpool to Saudi Pro League team Al-Hilal for a reported fee of €53 million. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for a large sum but struggled to consistently meet high expectations, scoring 40 goals in 143 appearances across all competitions. Despite moments of brilliance, including several crucial late winners, he was used less frequently under the new head coach last season. The move marks a significant change for both the player and for Liverpool, who are rebuilding their squad for the upcoming season.</p>

The talks, held at the request of the US, come just before a planned summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which has raised concerns among allies. The summit follows Trump's suggestion that a peace deal could involve Ukraine ceding territory, a position Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has firmly rejected. In response, several European leaders issued a joint statement reaffirming that Ukraine's future cannot be decided without its participation.</p>
