          <p>Chris Mason's article discusses the UK's ongoing and complex relationship with the EU, even after Brexit, highlighting the limitations imposed by the government's self-imposed guardrails during negotiations. The new deal seeks to reduce trade frictions, but numerous details, timelines, and costs remain to be addressed. Some critics argue that the agreement concedes too much power to the EU through 'dynamic alignment,' while ministers view it as a worthwhile compromise. The first UK-EU summit is planned to be the first of many, emphasizing the continuous need for conversation and negotiation between the two entities. The article emphasizes that the UK's relationship with the EU is a permanent or semi-permanent reset, and the direction of the current government is towards a closer relationship.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article details the Trump administration's efforts to acquire a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, driven by President Trump's desire for a new plane while still in office. The plan involved secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with Trump's Middle East envoy playing a key role. The proposed arrangement has faced condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans, raising ethical concerns about currying favor with the administration. Despite Qatar's denial of influence campaigns, questions remain about the financial sense of refitting the plane and its readiness for Trump's use before his term ends.</p>

          <p>Netflix has reached an agreement to bring Sesame Street to its streaming platform after Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with HBO. Starting later this year, Netflix will offer its global subscribers the 56th season of the show, along with 90 hours of previous episodes, while PBS will simultaneously have access to the episodes. Sesame Street has had a long history of influencing social issues, with segments on healthy eating and appearances before Congress.

          <h2>China Cuts Lending Rates to Boost Economy Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, as Beijing seeks to stimulate its economy amidst trade tensions. The People's Bank of China lowered the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. These rate cuts follow earlier reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders and are part of a broader package of stimulus measures. Trade-war fears have eased after a meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives, leading some investment banks to raise China's economic growth forecasts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision and allowed construction to restart on the Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island, after a month-long stop-work order. Governor Kathy Hochul stated that she pressed President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to lift the hold on the $5 billion project. The project, being built by Equinor, is expected to power 500,000 New York homes. The administration's initial halt had stunned observers and threatened the project's completion.</p>

President Trump is expected to visit House Republicans to urge them to support the bill. The legislation faces resistance in the Senate, and the inclusion of a debt limit increase adds urgency to its passage.</p>
