          <h2>US and Japan Announce Major Trade Agreement Lowering Auto Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:31:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which President Trump described as "massive." The agreement lowers the tariff on Japanese auto exports to the U.S. from 25% to 15%, a key concession for Japan's economy. In return, Japan will reportedly invest $550 billion in the United States and further open its markets to American goods, including vehicles and agricultural products. The deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who faces domestic pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new trade agreement between the United States and Japan has sparked optimism in the European automotive sector, leading to a rally in stock prices for major carmakers like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. The deal, which reduces U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles to 15%, has raised hopes that the European Union could secure a similar breakthrough in its own trade negotiations with Washington. The EU has been trying to avoid a threatened 30% tariff on its auto exports to the U.S. This development is seen as a potential blueprint for future agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams has made history by becoming the oldest woman to win a WTA Tour-level singles match since Martina Navratilova in 2004. At 45 years old, Williams defeated world number 35 Peyton Stearns, who is 22 years her junior, in the first round of the Washington Open. This victory marks a significant comeback for the seven-time Grand Slam champion, who had not played a singles match since March 2024. Williams asserted that she is playing for herself and has nothing to prove, demonstrating her enduring passion and commitment to the sport.</p>

The couple, who lived in Afghanistan for 18 years running education projects, are being held without charge.

The report highlights that China added ten times more power capacity last year than the U.S., a disparity that is becoming critical as the AI sector's energy demands skyrocket. With the U.S. AI industry projected to require at least 50 gigawatts of power by 2028, this energy gap is described as a "concerning" bottleneck that could hinder American competitiveness in this crucial technological field.</p>

The new law grants the prosecutor general greater control over these agencies, a move that has triggered the largest anti-government protests in Kyiv since the 2022 invasion. Western allies, including the EU and G7, have expressed serious concern, as a robust and independent anti-corruption framework is a key condition for Ukraine's financial aid and its path toward EU membership.

          <p>A SpaceX rocket launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base was aborted with just 45 seconds left on the countdown due to a major power outage in the Santa Barbara region. The outage disrupted communications at the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center, creating an unsafe condition for the launch. The rocket was carrying two NASA satellites for the TRACERS mission, designed to study the Earth's magnetosphere. The FAA also issued a ground stop at the local airport due to the outage. The launch, with its payload still in good condition, has been rescheduled for the following day.</p>

          <p>British musician FKA Twigs and actor Shia LaBeouf have reached a private settlement in the 2020 lawsuit in which she accused him of physical, mental, and emotional abuse during their relationship.

FKA Twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, had detailed multiple instances of alleged abuse, while LaBeouf had previously stated that many allegations were untrue but apologized for his actions.

          <p>Following his sentencing for the murders of four university students, Bryan Kohberger is anticipated to spend his life in Idaho's only super-max prison under extremely restrictive conditions. Experts suggest he will likely be placed in long-term segregated housing for his own protection, as inmates who harm women are often targeted by the general population. This would mean spending 23 hours a day in his cell, a harsh and solitary existence. This protective custody is designed for the state's most dangerous criminals or those who would be at risk from other prisoners.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, faces sentencing today, where he is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences without parole. The hearing will feature victim impact statements, allowing the families of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin to address the killer directly in court. The plea deal, which spared Kohberger the death penalty, has divided the families but will prevent a lengthy trial and appeals process. Kohberger admitted to the killings but has not yet provided a motive for the attack.</p>

The men, from various countries that refused to accept them, were sent to Eswatini under a "third country" deportation agreement. Eswatini's largest opposition party condemned the deal as "human trafficking disguised as a deportation," raising concerns about transparency and safety. US officials described the deported men as "depraved monsters," while Eswatini's government has assured its citizens that the men are securely imprisoned and that the US is covering all costs.</p>

Both artists commanded the stage, stripping back gimmicks to focus on their extensive and celebrated back catalogues.

          <p>Columbia University has taken disciplinary action, including suspensions and expulsions, against dozens of students who participated in pro-Palestinian campus protests earlier in the year. The protests, which included the occupation of a university library, made Columbia an epicenter of nationwide student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The university stated that the students were assessed individually for violating school policies that prohibit the disruption of academic activities. The move comes as the university attempts to restore federal funding that was cut by the Trump administration over its handling of the protests and alleged antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing a 13-million-year-old fossil have discovered evidence of a battle between two of South America's ancient top predators. The fossil, a leg bone from a large, flightless "terror bird," features distinct teeth marks that have been matched to a giant, five-meter-long crocodilian species called Purussaurus. Researchers believe the massive reptile likely ambushed the formidable bird at the water's edge in what was then a swampy region of Colombia. The finding provides rare insight into the predator-prey dynamics of the Miocene epoch, suggesting even the fearsome terror birds were vulnerable to attack.</p>

However, hours later, the Trump administration's Justice Department responded by firing Grace, accusing the judges of being "rogue" and "partisan."
