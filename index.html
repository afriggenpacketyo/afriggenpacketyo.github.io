          <p>A man in Norway was surprised to find a large container ship had run aground in his front garden, narrowly missing his house. Johan Helberg was alerted by his neighbor who saw the ship heading towards the shore in Byneset, near Trondheim, around 5:00 local time. The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, NCL Salten, carrying 16 people, had gone off course while traveling through the Trondheim Fjord. No injuries were reported, and authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, while the head of NCL expressed gratitude that no one was hurt and stated that they are awaiting the conclusion of the ongoing investigation by the relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the maker of the popular Labubu dolls, has temporarily stopped selling them in all UK stores until June due to reports of customers fighting over the toys. The decision follows incidents of chaos and unsafe conditions witnessed by customers, driven by the dolls' viral popularity on TikTok. Retail experts warn that this stock suspension may further increase demand, as the company works on a fairer system for distribution when the dolls return to shelves. The Labubu dolls, created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, have become a sought-after fashion accessory, with prices ranging from £13.50 to hundreds of pounds on resale sites.</p>

          <p>Questions are being raised about why President Joe Biden, one of the most medically scrutinized people, was not tested for prostate cancer for over a decade. Biden's aides claim that doctors stopped analyzing his PSA in 2014, following US regulations for men over 70, while others suggest a cover-up, as previous presidents released their PSA scores. Medical experts debate the appropriateness of halting testing at 71, especially given Biden's high public office and longer life expectancy. The debate also includes discussion of newer, more accurate tests and less invasive treatments for prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is set to stop producing new pennies following a decree by President Donald Trump, who considers the coin "so wasteful." The US Mint has made its final order of penny blanks and expects to halt production once these are used. Trump claims the penny costs the country too much, with the Treasury expecting annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs. While some argue for the penny's usefulness in charity drives, advocates for its abolishment cite its high production cost and limited utility. Jay Zagorsky, professor at Boston University, supports ending penny production but suggests Congress legislate the rounding of prices to eliminate demand.</p>

          <p>BYD surpassed Tesla in European battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales for the first time in April, despite tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. BYD's BEV sales increased by 169% year-on-year, reaching 7,231 units, while Tesla's sales fell by 49% to 7,165 units. This shift is considered a watershed moment for Europe's car market, as Tesla has led the BEV market for years. Chinese carmakers' BEV sales jumped 59% year-on-year, accounting for a significant portion of the growth in the European electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The term "DEI hire" is being used as a playground taunt, feeding an age-old grievance and a lurking sense that someone has a job that could have been yours. This creates a climate where prejudices, once unsayable, can be expressed with confidence. The fear is that these prejudices will spill back out into real-life conversations. The article argues that Britain is not America, not yet, but only if we make the effort to keep it that way.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa was overshadowed by Trump's focus on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. Trump presented misleading information about violence against white farmers, diverting the conversation from serious issues like trade and South Africa's genocide case against Israel. Despite Ramaphosa's attempts to steer the discussion towards bilateral trade and economic cooperation, Trump remained fixated on promoting his false claims. The meeting has drawn criticism for damaging diplomatic relations and prioritizing political theater over substantive discussions.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for the highest-paying customers of his personal cryptocurrency, prompting protests and ethical concerns.
