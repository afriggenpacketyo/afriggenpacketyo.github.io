          <p>PayPal has announced a new service, "Pay with Crypto," that will permit businesses to accept payments in more than 100 different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The service aims to simplify cross-border commerce by automatically converting crypto payments into fiat currency or stablecoins, such as PayPal's own PYUSD. To encourage adoption, PayPal is offering a promotional transaction rate of 0.99% until July 2026, which is notably lower than typical credit card fees. The company believes this will help address crypto's volatility and complexity challenges for merchants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that he intends to implement a baseline tariff of 15% to 20% on imports from countries that do not have specific trade agreements with the United States. This represents an increase from the 10% rate he previously announced and comes just before his August 1 deadline for nations to secure individual deals. The announcement was made in Scotland, where Trump noted that making separate deals with over 200 countries is not feasible. This policy shift could significantly impact smaller nations that were anticipating a lower tariff rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Shows Human Immune System Can Be Triggered by Visual Cues of Sickness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Swiss study has found that the human immune system can be activated merely by the sight of an infection, even in a virtual reality environment. Researchers observed that when participants viewed avatars appearing sick, their brains reacted and triggered a systemic immune response, evidenced by increased activity in specific immune cells in their blood. This response intensified when the sick-looking avatars appeared to move closer. The findings suggest the brain proactively prepares the body for a potential threat, opening possibilities for new non-pharmacological therapies, such as boosting vaccine efficacy or treating allergies.</p>

          <p>During a press conference in Scotland, former U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, calling him a "nasty person" who has done a "terrible job." The comments were made alongside UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who defended the mayor as a friend. This is not the first time Trump has publicly attacked Khan, having previously labeled him a "stone cold loser." Despite his criticism, Trump confirmed he would still visit London for his upcoming state visit to the UK in September.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is booking profits by selling shares of the industrial company Eaton, as its stock price reaches another record high. The sale is motivated by the belief that the recent stock surge, linked to a new U.S.-E.U. trade deal, is an overreaction to the market potential for its LNG-related products. The cash generated from this trade will be used to invest in other industrial stocks like Honeywell and Dover, which are viewed as having more growth potential. This specific transaction realizes a gain of approximately 75% on the shares sold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing a new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a dangerous condition that contributes to 5-10% of general aviation accidents. The system, which could be integrated into a flight suit or pilot's seat, uses haptic vibrations to provide sensory cues, similar to a car's lane departure warning. This would help pilots maintain their orientation when visual and equilibrium senses are compromised, such as in cloudy weather. Given that 90% of accidents caused by spatial disorientation are fatal, this technology could significantly improve flight safety.</p>

          <p>For savers with a substantial sum like $20,000, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently provide a higher and more secure return than high-yield savings accounts. Calculations show that for terms ranging from three months to one year, a CD with a fixed rate consistently earns more interest than a high-yield savings account with a variable rate. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% on $20,000 would earn $880, whereas a savings account at 4.30% would yield $860. The key advantage of a CD is its guaranteed return, which is locked in regardless of future interest rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

While some see it as a one-off financial decision, others view it as a sign of the genre's decline due to rising production costs, falling linear TV ad revenue, and shifting viewer habits. The article notes that while shows like Colbert's lose money on traditional advertising, they can be profitable when digital revenue is included. The fate of other shows, particularly ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026, will be a key indicator of the industry's direction.</p>

          <p>Former Finnish President Sauli Niinistö stated in an interview that he expects former U.S. President Donald Trump to continue his diplomatic approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Niinistö, who has experience dealing with both leaders, advised Trump in 2018 that Putin respects being opposed and that one must be careful with his proposals. He believes Europe must remain involved in these diplomatic efforts. Niinistö also commented that a militarily stronger Europe is necessary, as an aggressive neighbor who perceives you as weak is a dangerous combination, a reality he says Europe must confront.</p>

          <p>A new economic analysis indicates that the housing supply in America's fast-growing Sunbelt suburbs is plummeting, mirroring a trend that previously made coastal cities unaffordable. Economists Edward Glaeser and Joe Gyourko found that restrictive zoning and local opposition to new construction are closing "America's suburban frontier," threatening to make places like Phoenix and Atlanta as expensive as Los Angeles. The article argues that the post-war model of outward sprawl is becoming unsustainable, and without significant policy changes to allow for greater housing density, the nation's housing crisis will worsen.

Officials confirmed that 30-year-old Khalil Bryan, held on multiple charges including aggravated assault with a firearm, was accidentally let go due to a clerical error involving an inmate with a similar last name. The sheriff has taken full responsibility for the error, attributing it to a breakdown in verification protocols and launching an internal investigation.

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to cease funding for the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, they expressed grave concerns about the organization's operations, which they called a "death trap" due to the high number of civilians killed while trying to access its aid sites. The senators are demanding the U.S. resume support for established UN-led aid mechanisms instead.

          <p>In Nigeria's Zamfara state, kidnappers have killed at least 38 of the 56 people they abducted from a village in March, even after ransoms were paid for their release. A local official reported that the gunmen had demanded a ransom for each captive and, after receiving payment, released 18 women and a boy but slaughtered the remaining hostages. This brutal incident underscores the escalating crisis of kidnapping-for-ransom by criminal gangs in the region. Despite a 2022 law criminalizing ransom payments, families often feel compelled to pay due to the government's inability to provide security.</p>

          <p>The Sahel region has become a major hub for smuggling people, drugs, and other illicit goods, fueled by political instability and a shift in alliances towards Russia. Following military coups in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, new regimes have repealed anti-smuggling laws and deepened ties with Moscow, leading to a boom in criminal activity. Seizures of cocaine in the region have increased by over 11,000% since 2020, with criminal networks gaining significant financial power and corrupting local officials.

The team developed a risk-assessment framework to identify global hotspots where these genes are most prevalent and pose the greatest risk to human health.
