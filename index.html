          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to terminate grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities was unlawful. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by humanities organizations after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) abruptly cut congressionally-approved funding.

In a social media post, he stated the "new and highly accurate CENSUS" would utilize data from the 2024 election. This move represents a renewed effort to alter the decennial count, which determines congressional representation and federal funding, and follows a previous Supreme Court-blocked attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.</p>

          <p>A recent Australian study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that eggs are not detrimental to cholesterol levels as once believed. The research, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that saturated fat, not dietary cholesterol, is the primary driver of increased LDL ("bad") cholesterol. This finding supports a recent FDA advisory that deemed eggs "healthy," helping to settle the long-standing debate and reinforcing their nutritional value as a source of lean protein and vitamins.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4% in an effort to stimulate the UK's struggling economy. This move will likely lead to lower repayments for those on variable-rate mortgages but will reduce returns for savers. The article explains the central bank's balancing act, as the rate cut aims to boost growth and a weakening jobs market, even while inflation is projected to rise to 4% by September, complicating the bank's primary goal of price stability.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's broad tariff policies are not rooted in a strategic plan for economic development but rather in a powerful nostalgia for the manufacturing-heavy U.S. economy of the mid-20th century. The right-wing nationalist movement associates that era with social stability and strong family structures, viewing deindustrialization as a source of moral and economic decline. The article contends that this desire to resurrect a past economy is a fantasy, as global economic shifts toward services and automation make a return to mass manufacturing employment impossible.</p>

          <p>The article explores why Switzerland was hit with a high 39% U.S. tariff, suggesting its large trade surplus, heavily skewed by the gold refining industry, is a key reason. Although pharmaceuticals and luxury goods are major exports, the massive value of gold passing through Swiss refineries inflates trade figures, even though the profit margins for refiners are small. Swiss officials argue that gold should be excluded from trade balance calculations, but the U.S. has so far rejected this, leaving other Swiss industries to bear the brunt of the steep import duties.
