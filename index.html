          <p>The White House has clarified that the deployment of up to 1,700 National Guardsmen to 19 states is intended to assist the Department of Homeland Security with illegal immigration processing, not President Trump's wider initiative to combat violent crime in cities like Washington D.C. This operation, announced last month, involves Guard troops providing clerical and logistical support at ICE facilities. The administration maintains these efforts are separate from the federal interagency crime crackdown, which saw the National Guard activated in D.C. and may expand to Chicago and New York. The distinction highlights differing governmental priorities and the legal frameworks governing military assistance in civilian matters.</p>

          <p>The article reviews "Relay," a new paranoid thriller directed by David Mackenzie, starring Riz Ahmed as Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer. Ash specializes in helping whistleblowers disappear from dangerous entities, utilizing a text-telephone service for traceless communication. The film's premise offers a cynical update on classic 1970s thrillers, exploring the uneasy truce between individuals and powerful tormentors. The narrative follows biotech scientist Sarah, played by Lily James, as Ash guides her through a high-stakes cat-and-mouse chase, revealing his own past as a failed whistleblower and the isolating nature of his work.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Northern Virginia is actively working to prevent the extinction of over 20 species, including the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret. Scientists at the institute study reproduction, ecology, genetics, and migration with the goal of reintroducing species to their natural habitats. Conservation biologists express concern over the accelerating rate of species disappearance, noting the cascading effects on ecosystems when one species is lost. The article highlights successful efforts, such as the growth in the black-footed ferret population, demonstrating the critical role these institutions play in global conservation.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the Ukraine war is reshaping geopolitics in the former Soviet Union, notably seen in the US-brokered peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia, reducing Russia's traditional influence. While Russia officially welcomed the deal, some internal voices view it as a significant humiliation for Moscow. Azerbaijan is leveraging this shift to build new alliances with countries like Turkey and Central Asian states, asserting greater independence. The conflict has also exposed Russia's perceived weaknesses, leading other former Soviet states to adopt more multi-vector foreign policies and engage more with powers like China.</p>

          <p>A tour bus carrying 54 people rolled over on the New York State Thruway near Pembroke, resulting in five fatalities and numerous injuries. The bus, operated by M&Y Tour Inc., was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls when it lost control and veered into a ditch. Authorities identified the victims, who were of Indian, Chinese, and Filipino nationalities. While the cause remains under investigation, mechanical failure and operator impairment have been ruled out. Multiple hospitals treated the injured, with some patients in critical but stable condition, highlighting the severe impact of the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department announced it would not defend a decades-old grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), asserting the funding is unconstitutional. The department aligns with a lawsuit from Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, arguing the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity, citing a 2023 Supreme Court ruling. Over 500 colleges, including major universities, are designated as HSIs, receiving significant federal funding for various improvements. Critics, including the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, contend the grants are vital for equitable funding and constitutional, moving to intervene in the legal challenge.</p>

While the coalition agrees on the need for social insurance system reform due to rising costs, the SPD emphasizes imaginative solutions over mere benefit cuts.

          <h2>Alaska Landslide Triggers Massive Tsunami, Raising Climate Change Concerns</h2>

          <p>A colossal landslide in Alaska's Tracy Arm fjord triggered a powerful tsunami, reaching an incredible 1,400 feet up an opposite wall, making it one of the largest ever recorded. Scientists and officials consider it a "close call," as poor weather and early timing likely prevented casualties at the popular tourist destination. The event highlights increasing risks of such landslides near retreating glaciers, possibly due to "de-buttressing" effects and thawing permafrost linked to climate change. Geologists are monitoring other unstable slopes in Alaska, emphasizing the need for better understanding and warning systems for these potentially devastating natural phenomena.</p>

          <p>Experts are concerned that a surge in retail investor exuberance in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) market could be signaling an overheating market. Billions of dollars are pouring into risky, non-traditional ETFs like single-stock, leveraged, and inverse strategies, which are overwhelmingly owned by retail investors. ETF Action's Mike Akins warns that this "product proliferation" and retail-driven flows into speculative products, reminiscent of the 2020-2021 market peak, often serve as a contrarian indicator. Yield-focused products, such as covered call ETFs, are also highlighted as particularly risky if underlying stocks falter, potentially leading to significant losses. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article addresses a common retirement dilemma: a 66-year-old, Alex, who gave a year's notice, is now asked to stay two extra months as a part-time consultant to train his replacement. This scenario raises questions about potential impacts on retirement benefits, particularly Social Security, if he starts collecting while still earning income. The article advises that delaying Social Security could increase future benefits, and continued work allows for more 401(k) contributions and employer-provided health insurance. Ultimately, working longer generally improves retirement finances, but the decision involves weighing financial gains against personal retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 17 major US hospital systems, including Kaiser Permanente and Children's National Hospital, are discontinuing some or all pediatric gender-affirming care services for minors. This trend follows a Trump administration executive order in January stating the US would not fund or support gender transitions for those under 19, citing "legal and regulatory risks." While proponents argue gender-affirming care is crucial for mental health and supported by medical associations, critics question its long-term efficacy and potential risks.

The administration had sought to strip hundreds of millions of dollars in grants, arguing against subsidizing policies that impede immigration control.
