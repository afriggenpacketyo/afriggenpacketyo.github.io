The National Hurricane Center has warned that swells from the storm could generate life-threatening surf and rip currents for the islands by the end of the weekend.

          <p>An increasing number of schools across the United States are implementing Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case, to enforce bans on student cellphone use in classrooms. The system requires students to secure their phones in the pouch upon entering the school, which they carry with them but can only unlock at designated magnetic stations. While educators report positive changes like increased student engagement and social interaction, reactions from students have been mixed, with some welcoming the break from digital distractions and others attempting to bypass the system.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.8 billion for the next drawing, making it the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history. The surge comes after 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, tying a game record for the longest streak. If a single winner emerges, they will have the option of receiving the full amount as an annuity over 30 years or taking an estimated lump-sum cash payment of $826.4 million before taxes. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceptionally low at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>A 62-year-old Costa Mesa woman, Laura Lee Yourex, is facing five felony charges after allegedly registering her dog to vote and casting two fraudulent ballots in its name. According to the Orange County District Attorney's Office, she submitted mail-in ballots for her dog, Maya, in the 2021 gubernatorial recall and the 2022 primary election. The case came to light after Yourex reported herself to the Registrar of Voters, and an investigation uncovered social media posts where she documented her dog's voting activities. She faces up to six years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>At the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China projected its vision for a multipolar global order, positioning itself as a key diplomatic force. The event served as a platform for President Xi Jinping to enhance China's geopolitical profile as an alternative to US influence, particularly at a time of perceived instability in Western leadership. A notable moment of bonhomie between the leaders of China, Russia, and India was seen as a powerful symbol of this shifting dynamic, signaling a united front among nations often at odds with US foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has appeared to threaten the deployment of troops to Chicago for an immigration and crime crackdown, sharing a meme on social media that read, "Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR."

The threat raises concerns over the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, a practice restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act, and has heightened anxiety in Chicago's immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister has labeled rising sea levels a "life and death" issue for the island nation, where 30% of the land is less than five meters above sea level. Projections show sea levels could rise by over a meter by 2100, and up to five meters during storm surges, threatening critical infrastructure like airports and power plants located along the coast. In response to this existential threat, Singapore is investing billions of dollars into comprehensive coastal defense strategies, including the construction of seawalls, barriers, and extensive land reclamation projects.</p>

          <p>US independent director Jim Jarmusch has won the prestigious Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival for his film "Father Mother Sister Brother." The comedy-drama, starring Cate Blanchett and Adam Driver, explores the complex relationships between adult children and their parents. The festival's second-highest honor, the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize, went to "The Voice of Hind Rajab," a powerful film about a five-year-old Palestinian girl killed by Israeli forces. Acting awards were presented to China's Xin Zhilei and Italy's Toni Servillo.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a stunning late-game performance to lead Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four off Ed Barnard, securing the win with just one ball to spare. His unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls single-handedly turned the game around after Somerset's chase of 191 had looked unlikely. The thrilling finish sends Somerset to their record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day.</p>

In response, a Reform UK spokesperson stated that the party does not endorse Dr. Malholtra's scientifically unsupported claims but affirmed its belief in the principle of free speech.

The demonstration in Parliament Square saw hundreds gather to oppose the group's proscription under the Terrorism Act.

While some residents in neighborhoods concerned about crime welcome the potential for federal intervention, many others, particularly on the South Side, are strongly opposed. Community leaders and violence prevention workers argue that local, on-the-ground efforts are already reducing crime and that a military presence is not the answer.
