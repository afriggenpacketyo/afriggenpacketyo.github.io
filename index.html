          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, potentially jeopardizing Martin's confirmation. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases, which were prosecuted by the D.C. Attorney's Office before Trump's blanket pardons. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination faces an uphill battle in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where a tie vote would prevent it from moving forward. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire on May 20.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka staged a predawn demonstration outside an immigrant detention facility slated to become a key part of the Trump administration's deportation efforts. Baraka argues that the facility's owner, GEO Group, lacks the necessary permits to operate, leading to a tense standoff. Fire officials issued three citations for code violations after city officials were barred from inspecting the property. The facility, near Newark Liberty International Airport, has a $1 billion contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 migrants daily, despite lacking a valid certificate of occupancy. This action highlights the ongoing conflict between local authorities and the federal government over immigration enforcement.</p>

The Israeli military stated that the strike targeted flight runways, aircraft, and infrastructure, claiming the airport was totally disabled. The Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have been launching rockets and drones at Israel and ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians. Yemeni analysts suggest that these attacks will not deter the Houthis and may strengthen their political narrative, while civilians in Sanaa view the strikes as collective punishment.</p>

          <p>A late payment can significantly damage your credit score, affecting loan rates and even job prospects. The article outlines several strategies to mitigate the impact, including requesting a goodwill adjustment from the creditor, disputing inaccuracies with credit bureaus, and negotiating a "pay for delete" agreement. If these methods fail, the late payment will remain on your credit report for up to seven years, but its impact diminishes over time. Maintaining consistent on-time payments after a late mark is crucial for rebuilding credit and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Britain and India have reached a trade agreement designed to boost economic cooperation amidst global trade uncertainties. The deal, expected to increase bilateral trade by Â£25.5 billion, involves India reducing tariffs on 90% of goods, with many becoming tariff-free within a decade, including significant cuts on British whiskey and car tariffs. Britain, in turn, will reduce tariffs on clothes, footwear, and food products from India. The agreement is seen as a positive step for both economies, especially for Britain as it seeks to expand trade relationships post-Brexit.</p>

He suggests that even a partial rollback of tariffs would still represent a significant tax increase, negatively impacting economic growth. Jones anticipates that macroeconomic conditions will continue to deteriorate, requiring a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve to prevent further declines.</p>

Some predators even host 'watch parties' to torment victims live online.
