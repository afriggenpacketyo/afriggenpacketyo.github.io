          <p>A British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has publicly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's proposal to recognize a Palestinian state. The former hostage, Emily Damari, argued that such a move risks rewarding terrorism and sends a dangerous message that violence can earn legitimacy. Her statement aligns with concerns from lawyers representing other British hostage families, who fear the policy could disincentivize Hamas from releasing remaining captives. They are urging the Prime Minister to clarify that the UK will not take substantive steps toward recognition until all hostages are freed.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to end the "de minimis" trade exemption for all countries, which previously allowed imported goods valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. This move expands a previous order that targeted China and Hong Kong, impacting online retailers like Temu and Shein that utilized the loophole. The administration stated the policy change is necessary to close a "big scam" that hurts U.S. businesses and facilitates the shipment of illicit substances. The change is set to take effect on August 29, with stock prices for affected companies like PDD Holdings and Amazon slipping after the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, addressed his past calls to defund the police during his first press conference following a deadly mass shooting in Manhattan. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, attributed his 2020 statements to the widespread frustration following the murder of George Floyd. While he has since walked back his stance, he faced questions about whether his prior rhetoric bears any responsibility for threats against the NYPD. Mamdani deflected direct responsibility, instead focusing on his current public safety vision and criticizing political opponents for using the tragedy for political gain.</p>

          <p>For homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) present a viable alternative to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. As of late July 2025, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.40%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 8.26%. These products offer lower rates and potential tax benefits if used for eligible home improvements. However, homeowners must be cautious as the home serves as collateral, risking foreclosure if payments are not made as agreed. (not investment advice)</p>

Some of the packs were found to contain Celsius energy drink cans that had been incorrectly filled with the alcoholic seltzer. This mistake poses a health and safety risk, as consumers could unknowingly ingest alcohol. The issue was traced to a packaging supplier, and while no illnesses have been reported, customers are urged to discard any affected cans and contact the company for a refund.</p>

The January 29 crash resulted in the deaths of all 64 people on the plane and three crew members on the helicopter. The hearing is part of an ongoing investigation to determine the exact cause and prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>A New York woman has pleaded guilty to her role in a $30 million investment fraud scheme that illegally sold foreign nationals access to a 2017 fundraiser with then-President Donald Trump.

The scheme defrauded investors, many from China, with false promises of U.S. residency through a fictitious development project. Li and her co-conspirator charged foreign nationals $93,000 each for access to the event, using the funds for unlawful political contributions.</p>

          <p>A severe hunger crisis is intensifying in Gaza, with humanitarian groups predicting that 100% of the population will soon face acute food insecurity. The situation worsened dramatically after a ceasefire ended in March, leading Israel to cut off aid for two months, severely limiting subsequent deliveries. While Israel denies using starvation as a weapon, critics point to the breakdown of aid distribution systems, with both UN and a new US-backed foundation struggling to operate amid chaos and violence. Experts argue that only a full-scale, unimpeded humanitarian operation and an end to the war can avert further catastrophe.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding its benchmark interest rate steady, borrowers with high-interest debt, particularly from credit cards, are encouraged to explore proactive relief strategies. This article suggests three key moves: conducting a close budget review to cut unnecessary spending, understanding the risks of various debt relief options like credit counseling or debt management programs, and addressing the root causes of debt accumulation. Taking these steps can help individuals regain financial control rather than waiting for potential rate cuts from the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

While Hawaii experienced waves up to 1.7 meters and some coastal flooding, the warning was later downgraded to an advisory. Similarly, other regions including the U.S. West Coast and Japan saw smaller-than-expected waves, and despite the quake's immense strength, no severe damage or injuries were reported.</p>

          <p>After more than three decades, a renewed effort is underway to solve the infamous 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop. Advances in DNA technology are providing new hope that a key piece of evidence, a male DNA profile found on one of the victims, can finally identify a suspect. Previous Y-STR testing led to the release of two men who were convicted based on coerced confessions, as the DNA did not match them. Although a recent potential lead from a public database proved to be a false match, investigators remain hopeful that further scientific progress will solve the case.</p>

          <p>President Trump is calling for an end to the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, which allows home-state senators to effectively veto presidential nominees for federal judges and U.S. attorneys in their states. The call comes after the temporary appointment of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey expired due to opposition from the state's Democratic senators. Trump argues the practice is a "scam" preventing him from installing his choices in blue states. Critics warn that eliminating the blue slip could enable the appointment of loyalist prosecutors and judges, potentially leading to politically motivated trials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International aid organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, are denouncing recent airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza as a "futile initiative" and "symbolic politics." Critics argue that airdrops are notoriously inefficient, dangerous, and up to 35 times more expensive than land convoys, often failing to reach the most vulnerable populations. They contend that the focus should be on pressuring Israel to open border crossings for unhindered ground access, which would allow for a much larger and more effective distribution of aid. These groups state that hundreds of aid trucks are needed daily to address the unfolding famine.</p>

          <p>President Faustin-Archange Touadera of the Central African Republic (CAR) has been nominated by his party to run for a third term, a move made possible by a controversial 2023 referendum.

Amid rising distrust and fears that the 2025 election's integrity is already compromised, opposition groups are demanding a national dialogue before proceeding with the electoral process.

          <p>The city council of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany, has ordered the demolition of a nearly completed mosque due to a contractual failure by the Islamic association building it. The association, VIKZ, was granted a building permit in 2014 with a four-year completion deadline, which it failed to meet. After a legal battle that went to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, the city's right to revoke the permit was upheld. Despite the demolition order and an offer from the city to help find an alternative site, VIKZ has stated it will not tear down the building.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reported that seven more people, including children, have died from malnutrition, bringing the total to 154 since the conflict began. This comes as UN-backed experts warn that a worst-case famine scenario is currently unfolding in the territory. Despite these reports, Israel maintains it is not restricting aid, a claim disputed by its allies and humanitarian agencies. The crisis has prompted a visit from a U.S. special envoy to Israel, while deadly incidents continue to occur near aid distribution sites, complicating relief efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant costs from tariffs on imported materials and vehicles, major automakers have so far avoided passing these expenses on to consumers. Data shows that new vehicle prices have risen less than their historical average, as companies absorbed billions in tariff-related losses to maintain sales and market share. However, this strategy is likely temporary. Industry experts predict that car prices could rise by 4-8% with the arrival of 2026 models, as automakers face pressure from investors to protect their profit margins by either cutting costs elsewhere or increasing sticker prices.

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids in California are causing noticeable economic disruption, according to researchers and business leaders. An analysis of census data revealed a significant decline in the number of people reporting to work, a downturn comparable only to the COVID-19 lockdown period. Industries such as agriculture, construction, and tourism, which heavily rely on immigrant labor, are reporting shortages and reduced business activity. Economists warn that continued disruptions could lead to broader negative impacts, including project delays and increased food prices nationwide.</p>

          <p>Workers at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a former nuclear bomb component facility, discovered a radioactive wasp nest during a routine inspection. The nest, found near tanks storing liquid nuclear waste, had radiation levels 10 times higher than federal regulations permit. Officials stated there is no danger to the public, attributing the radioactivity to legacy contamination from the site's operational history rather than a new leak. The nest was safely removed and disposed of as radioactive waste, though a watchdog group has called for more information on the contamination's source.</p>
