          <p>Social media influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate have been formally charged in the United Kingdom with multiple offenses, including sexual assault and human trafficking. The charges, authorized in January 2024, mark the first time the brothers have faced criminal charges in Britain, though they have been under investigation in Romania for similar crimes. Andrew faces 10 charges related to three women, while Tristan faces 11 charges related to one woman. The brothers, who deny all allegations, are also under investigation for failure to pay taxes in the U.K. and for allegedly trafficking underage girls in Romania.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing Sean Combs trial for sex trafficking and racketeering, a stylist testified about witnessing Combs beating Casandra Ventura and pressuring her into coerced sexual acts.

Los Angeles authorities also detailed calls to Kid Cudi's home following a burglary and arson incident involving Kid Cudi's Porsche, which the police believe Combs was responsible for. The defense's request for a mistrial was denied after arguing prosecutors unfairly suggested Combs was responsible for destroying fingerprint evidence.</p>

          <p>Canada's decision to cull 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm due to avian flu has drawn criticism from U.S. officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz. The ostriches were ordered to be culled after the avian virus spread through Universal Ostrich Farms, but Kennedy and Oz have urged Canadian authorities to consider further testing to understand the virus, with Oz even offering to relocate the birds to his Florida ranch. Veterinarians, however, argue that keeping the potentially infected birds alive poses a public health risk, while the farm owners lost a legal battle to keep the birds alive.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the "TACO" trade acronym, which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out," used to describe his pattern of announcing tariffs and later easing them. When asked about the term, Trump called it a "nasty question" and defended his actions as negotiation tactics. Analysts note investors are becoming more comfortable with this pattern, though concerns remain about the potential impact of tariffs on businesses and the U.S. fiscal outlook. The analyst Adam Crisafulli noted that the market is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly developing a space defense system to protect its Tiangong space station from potentially interfering spacecraft. According to scientist Sun Zhibin, the system would involve deploying small robotic thrusters to latch onto and redirect suspicious objects approaching the space station. This development follows China's report to the United Nations that Tiangong had to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions with SpaceX's Starlink satellites in 2021. The report says Starlink satellites were descending from their usual orbits and entering Tiangong’s operational zone, prompting emergency avoidance actions.</p>

          <p>A group of Tesla investors, including pension fund leaders, has sent a letter to Tesla's board chair demanding Elon Musk dedicate more time to the electric vehicle company. Citing concerns over Tesla's stock price volatility, declining sales, and human rights practices, the investors are requesting Musk work a minimum of 40 hours per week at Tesla. They also seek a clear succession plan and a policy limiting directors' outside board commitments. Tesla's brand value has reportedly declined due to Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities, with the company's stock price down 12% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Nations has condemned Israel's new aid operation in southern Gaza following a chaotic launch where thousands of Palestinians rushed a food distribution site, prompting Israeli forces to fire warning shots. The UN and many humanitarian groups have boycotted the initiative, which aims to bypass both the United Nations and Hamas, accusing it of violating humanitarian principles. European diplomats criticized the program and Israel's offensive, while the Trump administration is pressing for a cease-fire. Jonathan Whittall, a senior U.N. humanitarian official, called the Israeli attempt to seize control of the humanitarian aid for Palestinians part of “an assault on their human dignity.”</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with data center sales jumping 73%, driven by strong demand for AI chips. The company expects about $45 billion in sales in the current quarter, though this guidance would have been higher if not for export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang stated that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry." The company's gross margin was impacted by the China-related charge.

MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated that the school's success depends on attracting talented people from every background and ensuring everyone feels welcome and supported. The closure coincides with the Trump administration's actions against Harvard University, including freezing research grants over alleged discriminatory hiring practices and insufficient action against antisemitism.</p>
