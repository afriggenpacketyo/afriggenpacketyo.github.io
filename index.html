          <p>South Korea has started removing loudspeakers used for anti-Pyongyang broadcasts along its border, a move initiated by President Lee Jae-myung's administration to ease tensions. This action is part of a broader effort to improve relations and restore trust, following North Korea's reciprocal cessation of its own broadcasts. Despite these de-escalation measures, Pyongyang recently rejected an offer for dialogue, signaling that significant diplomatic challenges remain between the two nations, which are still technically at war.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD reported its first monthly drop in deliveries for the year, a consequence of an aggressive price war reshaping the competitive landscape. While competitors like Li Auto and Nio also saw declines, others such as Xpeng and Xiaomi posted record or growing sales, highlighting a fractured market. The intense competition, which saw BYD discount some models by 30%, has prompted warnings from Beijing's top leaders to curb excessive price cutting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Welsh health board in Powys has instructed English hospitals to align their treatment schedules with Wales's longer waiting times for procedures like knee and hip replacements. The board stated it could not afford the faster service provided in England, a move expected to save over £16 million but which has left patients uninformed and facing extended delays. This policy highlights the stark differences in healthcare access, with over 10,000 patients in Wales waiting two years for treatment compared to just 158 in England.</p>

This announcement comes as a record number of over 25,000 people have made the crossing from France so far this year. The initiative aims to track and dismantle the criminal networks responsible, though it has drawn criticism from opposition parties and Reform UK as insufficient to stop the crossings.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the real danger in the UK's current political climate is not the rise of new parties like Jeremy Corbyn's, but the risk of systemic inertia. It argues that both major parties are failing to address critical issues, leading to widespread disaffection and a fragmented political landscape where the establishment maintains power despite its decay. The author suggests this creates a "miserable status quo" of escalating public rage and an impotent government, where new movements struggle to enact meaningful change.</p>

          <p>Germany's birth rate has fallen to a new low of 1.35 children per woman, sparking debate about societal values and economic stability. Experts attribute the decline to multiple crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and inflation, which create uncertainty for young people considering families. The article highlights the "fertility gap," where people desire more children than they have, suggesting that improved work-life balance and more reliable state support like childcare could help address the demographic challenge and prevent long-term economic strain.</p>

          <p>In this article, journalist Rokhaya Diallo describes the persistent challenge of being a Muslim in France, where individuals are often treated as "the enemy within" and pressured to disavow terrorism. She recounts personal experiences of being defamed and links this to a broader political narrative that frames any Muslim voice, from footballers to fashion influencers, as a potential threat of "infiltration." The article argues that the French state fuels this Islamophobic climate, creating a paradox where Muslims are blamed for being both separate from and part of the national community.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a disturbing international network, with members in the UK, that creates and shares videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. Operating on encrypted messaging apps, these groups are believed to have thousands of members who sell graphic content and encourage others to participate, with some UK-based members reportedly discussing adopting kittens from shelters for abuse. The report highlights the extreme cruelty involved and the global reach of this hidden community, prompting calls for police action.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Cuba and the UK have initiated a collaborative mission to save the endangered Polymita tree snails, renowned for their vibrantly colored and patterned shells. The snails' beauty has unfortunately made them a target for the illegal shell trade, which is pushing the six known species toward extinction. The project aims to understand the snails' unique genetics, establish a captive breeding program, and provide crucial information to aid conservation efforts against threats from poaching, climate change, and habitat loss.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for motorists who were mis-sold car finance through deals with hidden commission charges. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while narrowing the scope for many claims, deemed deals with particularly large commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

Benoit emphasized that Israel's control over aid makes it responsible for the crisis, and U.S. backing implicates it as well, a situation she described as an "obvious connecting of the dots."</p>

          <p>Sexual health clinics across the UK have started offering a vaccine for gonorrhoea in a world-first national rollout aimed at curbing record-high infection levels. The vaccine will initially be given to high-risk groups, primarily gay and bisexual men, with health officials predicting it could prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade. This public health initiative comes as doctors grow increasingly concerned about the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of the sexually transmitted infection, which saw over 85,000 cases in 2023.</p>

Real estate agents argue the prices are justified due to scarcity, though potential buyers face significant hurdles, including the growing difficulty of securing home insurance. As insurers pull back from high-risk fire zones in California, the challenge of obtaining coverage is becoming a major obstacle for homeowners and could impact long-term property values.

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has indicated that the tariff rates announced for over 60 trading partners are "pretty much set" and are unlikely to be negotiated down. The statement came after the White House released its tariff plan, which imposes a baseline 10% rate on all imports from dozens of countries, including key allies who have not yet secured deals. This hardline stance is part of the administration's strategy to reduce the trade deficit and rebalance global trade. (not investment advice)</p>
