          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:13:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is actively exploring the option of suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a constitutional right that allows individuals to challenge the legality of their detention in court. Miller argued that the Constitution permits this suspension during times of invasion, reflecting the administration's view of the situation at the border. The administration has faced judicial challenges to its deportation efforts, particularly concerning the deportation of undocumented immigrants without court proceedings, and Miller suggested that Trump's decision hinges on whether the courts align with the administration's deportation policies. This move is highly controversial, as habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in U.S. history, usually with Congressional authorization.</p>

          <p>Several USAID employees who spoke to reporters after receiving termination notices from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an organization overseen by Elon Musk, are now facing internal investigations. The employees received emails accusing them of unauthorized engagement with the press, threatening disciplinary action, including potential removal from USAID. Randy Chester, vice president of the American Foreign Service Association, criticized the inquiry as intimidation, while attorney Abbe Lowell argued it aims to silence criticism. The agency, which faced drastic personnel cuts due to DOGE, is now investigating employees who believed they had already lost their jobs, creating a chilling effect on those with stories to share or lawsuits against the government.</p>

          <p>Speculation about a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, dubbed "Yalta 2.0," did not materialize this week. Instead, Xi and Putin met in Moscow, pledging to extend cooperation and counter what they perceive as Washington's attempt at "dual containment" of their countries. Trump, initially confident in his deal-making abilities, has faced resistance from both Beijing and Moscow on issues vital to their national interests. Trump's tariff and Ukraine policies have also caused global concerns about the unraveling of the U.S.-led post-war order, leaving little prospect for meaningful cooperation between the three nations in solving persistent challenges like the Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to bring white Afrikaners from South Africa to the United States as refugees, citing unjust racial discrimination. This move comes as South Africa considers legislation allowing for expropriation of land without compensation under certain circumstances. Stephen Miller stated that this situation fits the definition of why the refugee program was created, emphasizing race-based persecution. The South African government has criticized this effort, questioning the refugees' status and accusing the Trump administration of undermining South Africa's constitutional democracy and ignoring its history of apartheid. The refugees are expected to be resettled in states like Minnesota, Idaho, and Alabama.</p>

Baraka, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, was taken into custody after demanding access to the facility where a group of protesters and U.S. House Democrats had gathered. Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba stated that Baraka ignored multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials, while Rep.

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives passed a Republican-backed bill to restrict property ownership by citizens of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, gaining momentum after failing to pass two years ago.

Critics, including Democratic representatives and Asian-American groups, have denounced the bill as xenophobic and discriminatory.

          <p>Los Angeles County is experiencing a surge in hepatitis A cases, a highly contagious liver infection, with at least seven deaths reported. Public health officials have declared an outbreak, noting that the virus is spreading among groups not typically at risk, such as those with good hygiene and access to potable water. The hepatitis A virus is transmitted through the oral-fecal route, and symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea, and jaundice. The best way to prevent infection is through vaccination, but many adults have not received the shots, underscoring the need to reassess prevention efforts. There is no specific antiviral medication for hepatitis A, and treatment focuses on rest and fluids.</p>

The outrage following George Floyd's murder initially sparked demands for accountability, but systemic reforms have stalled. The trial, held with an all-white jury from outside Memphis, resulted in no murder convictions for the officers, highlighting the rarity of such convictions and the challenges prosecutors face. The failure to secure convictions and the lack of broader accountability suggest that Nichols will not be the last to suffer an unjust death at the hands of police.</p>

          <p>Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson, in his first all-hands meeting, warned staff not to obstruct his agenda, stating he would "run right over" anyone undermining his efforts to achieve the president's intent. Richardson emphasized his determination to reduce FEMA's scope and carry out President Trump's will, referencing his military experience and commitment to duty. His appointment follows the firing of former acting administrator Cameron Hamilton, who publicly opposed the elimination of FEMA. Richardson's remarks signal a significant shift in the agency's direction, focusing on cost-sharing with states and reducing federal involvement.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to steep tariffs imposed by President Trump, making it costly for U.S. retailers to import goods from China. The data released from China's General Administration of Customs shows a 21% decrease in shipments of goods from China to the U.S. compared to the same period last year. Simultaneously, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, reflecting a shift in trade patterns due to the tariffs. While Trump suggested lowering tariffs to 80%, this rate would still be prohibitively expensive for many U.S. businesses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has praised the new trade pact with the U.K. as a "maxed out deal," but experts suggest it may not be as beneficial as it seems. Although the deal offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports, higher than the pre-Trump effective tariff rate of 3%. While lower than some tariffs imposed on other nations, this baseline levy could still lead to higher costs for U.S. businesses and consumers. Economists warn that the deal may not fully offset the negative impacts of higher tariffs and ongoing trade uncertainty.</p>
