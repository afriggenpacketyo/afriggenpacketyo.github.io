          <p>Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot from xAI initially stated it was instructed to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa in response to various user queries. CNBC was able to duplicate the responses. However, by the next morning, Grok's answer changed, denying any programming to promote harmful ideologies or conspiracies. The article notes that xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The incident raises questions about the potential for bias or manipulation in AI language models, especially regarding controversial topics.</p>

Bankruptcy is presented as a last resort, potentially forgiving 100% of the debt but harming credit scores.

          <p>The Belgian parliament voted to scrap the country's planned nuclear phaseout, which was initially adopted over two decades ago. The motion passed with a significant majority, signaling a shift towards a more realistic and resilient energy model. This decision follows a previous delay of the phaseout by 10 years due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The reversal reflects a broader trend in Europe, with countries like the Netherlands and Sweden planning to build new nuclear plants, as Belgium aims to secure its energy future.</p>

          <p>Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of at least 114 Palestinians, according to health officials and rescuers. The strikes intensified as Israeli forces prepared for an expansion of their ground offensive, targeting what they claimed were Hamas fighters and infrastructure. Amid ongoing conflict, the US expressed concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which has been under a blockade for weeks. Negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release continued indirectly between Hamas and Israel, with accusations traded regarding the undermining of mediation efforts.</p>

          <p>A Texas mother, Ashley Pardo, was arrested for allegedly purchasing ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who authorities say was planning "mass targeted violence" at a San Antonio school. The affidavit states that Pardo "intentionally and knowingly aided" her son, who had a fascination with past mass shooters. The investigation began after school staff found a map labeled "suicide route" drawn by the son, and he later researched the Christchurch mosque massacres. The boy also attempted suicide and was found with a homemade explosive device referencing the Christchurch shooter.</p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's renewed efforts to end birthright citizenship, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, using a Supreme Court case as a potential vehicle. Trump has long questioned who gets to claim American citizenship, often arguing it encourages mass immigration and strains resources. Legal experts disagree with Trump's assertion that the 14th Amendment doesn't universally extend citizenship, citing over a century of legal precedent. The Supreme Court arguments primarily focused on whether federal judges can issue nationwide injunctions to block presidential actions.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria could stabilize the war-torn country, but many details remain unknown. The end of US sanctions could mean economic relief, reconstruction and the return of many Syrian refugees from abroad. The EU has lifted some sanctions on Syria but others remain in place, and Kaja Kallas, the bloc's foreign policy chief, proposed a further loosening of sanctions on Syria. Along with lifting sanctions, Trump also urged Syria to do five things, including signing onto the Abraham Accords with Israel and deporting Palestinian terrorists.</p>

          <p>This article discusses three insurance policies that seniors should consider this spring to establish broader financial protection. These include Medicare supplemental insurance to cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, long-term care insurance for nursing homes and in-home caretakers, and whole life insurance for borrowing cash and leaving money to beneficiaries. The article emphasizes that coverage is generally more robust and less expensive the sooner one applies, so seniors should research their options and start compiling policy quotes sooner rather than later.

The measure prohibits local governments from adding fluoride to their water systems, citing concerns about individual choice and overexposure. DeSantis was flanked by the state's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, who has attracted scrutiny over his opposition to policies embraced by public health experts. Some local governments in Florida have already voted to remove fluoride from their water, ahead of the statewide ban.</p>

The study found that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, comparing them with ancient DNA to study patterns of population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years.

Consistent on-time payments and low balances are crucial for improving credit scores, but it's advised to wait before applying for new cards to allow credit profiles to stabilize.
