          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their opening game of the California Classic summer league to the Golden State Warriors, 89-84, after surrendering a double-digit lead. The team's perimeter defense struggled, though bright spots included Cole Swider, who scored 24 points, and DJ Steward with 20 points. Recent draft pick Dalton Knecht had a difficult game, shooting just three for thirteen from the field. Lakers prospect Bronny James traveled with the team but did not play in the game.</p>

          <p>An expert hydrologist explains the scientific reasons why the Texas Hill Country, known as "Flash Flood Alley," is one of the most dangerous places in the U.S. for flash flooding. The region's unique geography, including steep hills, shallow soil that poorly absorbs water, and the Balcones Escarpment, contributes to rapid and powerful runoff into rivers. The article notes that climate change is intensifying the risk by allowing the atmosphere to hold more moisture, leading to more extreme downpours.</p>

The approach aims to make adversaries and allies believe he is capable of anything, thereby coercing them into making concessions.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its efforts to counter China's influence in the technology sector with a new executive order targeting Chinese-made drones. However, industry analysts and insiders caution that China's overwhelming dominance of the global drone market makes its products incredibly difficult to replace in supply chains. With very few non-Chinese alternatives available, a potential ban is seen as a move that could significantly increase costs and disrupt commercial drone operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration is under fire for sending a widely circulated email that critics have labeled as misleading and partisan. The email claimed that President Trump's new spending bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." However, the legislation actually provides a temporary tax deduction, not a permanent elimination of the tax. Former officials have condemned the communication as an unconscionable political statement from a traditionally apolitical agency. (not investment advice)</p>

The commanding win gives England a strong start to their two-match series against the Pumas ahead of the second Test next week.</p>
