          <p>The UK government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill, granting parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, but the new law will extend the right to cover earlier losses as well. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people crucial time to grieve without the pressure of returning to work immediately. The exact length of the leave and other specific details are still under consultation, marking a significant shift in legal recognition for early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>A paramedic and clinical team leader with the Scottish Ambulance Service has been sentenced to ten and a half years in prison for secretly administering an abortion drug to a woman, causing their unborn child's death. Stephen Doohan committed the act after learning the woman was pregnant with his child while he was married to someone else. He pleaded guilty to assault, sexual assault, and causing an abortion by injecting the crushed pills into the victim at his home. The judge described his actions as leaving the victim with a lifetime of pain and loss, imposing an indefinite non-harassment order.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan, a nation the U.S. government warns its own citizens not to visit due to conflict and instability. None of the men, who are from various Asian and Latin American countries, are citizens of South Sudan. The deportation followed a prolonged legal challenge from immigration advocates who argued the move was unconstitutional and punitive, fearing the men could face torture or other harm. The action represents a significant development in the administration's immigration policy, establishing a precedent for deporting non-citizens to third-party countries regardless of their human rights records.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that morning workouts, particularly between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., can be highly effective for weight loss, as research links this timing to a lower risk of obesity and smaller waist sizes. The benefits are attributed to the release of mood-boosting chemicals like endorphins and dopamine, which energize the body and mind for the day. However, fitness and wellness experts emphasize that these benefits are contingent on getting adequate sleep, typically seven to eight hours per night. Prioritizing sleep over an early workout is recommended if one is sleep-deprived, as rest is crucial for muscle repair, growth, and overall fitness progress.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old from Lurgan, County Armagh, has set a new record by becoming the youngest person to swim the North Channel solo from Northern Ireland to Scotland. Oscar Black completed the grueling journey from the Gobbins to Portpatrick in 16 hours and 38 minutes. Due to strong currents, he swam a total distance of 46km, significantly more than the direct 35km route. Throughout the swim, he endured numerous jellyfish stings and battled strong currents that stalled his progress for hours, describing the ordeal as more of a mental challenge than a physical one, but ultimately worth the effort.</p>

          <p>In contrast to a growing national trend of punitive measures, Los Angeles County is embracing harm reduction to tackle its large-scale homelessness and addiction crises. The new Skid Row Care Campus offers a range of services, from housing and addiction treatment to clean syringes and drug-testing strips for those not ready to quit. Proponents argue this approach saves lives, prevents the spread of disease, and can eventually guide individuals toward recovery by meeting them where they are. The strategy, however, is controversial and stands in opposition to calls for forced treatment and criminalization at the federal level.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's trade policy reveals a preference for using tariffs as a tool for negotiating bilateral deals, a departure from previous multilateral approaches. The article explains that tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. companies on imported goods, with costs often passed to consumers, challenging the narrative that foreign countries pay them. It details the history of the current tariff situation, including the April "Liberation Day" announcement and subsequent 90-day pause, highlighting the uncertainty this creates for global trade and the domestic economy. This approach uses the U.S. economy's size as leverage to secure deals quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

However, many nutrition scientists argue that these claims are overstated, pointing to studies showing that replacing saturated fats with plant-based oils improves health outcomes. While critics raise concerns about chemical processing and an imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids promoting inflammation, research does not consistently support this in real-world human studies. Experts largely agree that the bigger issue is the overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, where seed oils are prevalent, rather than the oils themselves.</p>

While the original Saba Saba had clear political leaders, today's Gen Z-led protests are a grassroots movement, unified by technology rather than specific figures or ethnic ties.

          <p>After making landfall in South Carolina as a tropical storm, Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved into North Carolina. While storm warnings were canceled, the system brought heavy rainfall, with up to six inches in some areas, leading to significant flash flooding concerns. In Chatham County, North Carolina, over 100 roads were reported flooded, and a portion of a state highway collapsed. Emergency crews were rescuing stranded motorists, and residents along the rising Haw River were being notified of the danger. The system is expected to continue weakening as it moves northeast.</p>

          <p>The first round of indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas in Doha has concluded without any significant progress, according to Palestinian sources. The lack of advancement in talks coincides with rising domestic tensions within Israel, as the military announced it will begin sending conscription notices to 54,000 previously exempt ultra-Orthodox Jewish men. This controversial move, following a Supreme Court ruling, could destabilize Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition government, which includes ultra-Orthodox parties. Meanwhile, BRICS leaders issued a statement expressing grave concern over the situation in Gaza and condemning recent military strikes on Iran.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old girl in Buena Park, California, was fatally struck by illegal fireworks during a Fourth of July gathering. According to police, a homeowner had set up a fireworks mortar in the street which began to malfunction, firing projectiles toward a residence where other illegal fireworks were stored. This triggered a secondary explosion that hit the child, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The homeowner has been arrested, and the incident is part of a string of deadly and injurious fireworks-related events across California over the holiday, highlighting the extreme dangers of unauthorized pyrotechnics.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Germany's eastern states have managed to bring several large wildfires under control after a difficult weekend. The state of Thuringia experienced its largest forest fire in over three decades in the Saalfeld-Rudolstadt district, exhausting emergency crews. Hundreds of firefighters were also deployed to battle blazes in the Gohrischheide region between Saxony and Brandenburg, which burned large areas of natural landscape. The fires broke out as Germany and much of Western Europe experienced the first major heatwave of the summer, creating dangerous conditions for fire spread.</p>

The advanced stealth aircraft was diverted to Thiruvananthapuram airport on June 14 due to bad weather and has since been grounded by a technical snag. After an initial assessment by engineers from its carrier, the HMS Prince of Wales, proved unsuccessful, this specialist team was deployed with necessary equipment.

          <p>The United States has lifted a ban on selling American jet engine components to China, a move expected to support the production of China's homegrown C919 aircraft. The agreement allows the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to import critical parts from a joint venture involving GE, ensuring it can fulfill hundreds of existing orders for its narrowbody jet. Analysts note that this access is crucial for Comac's production schedule and its ambitions to expand into foreign markets like the EU. However, they also caution that previous U.S. restrictions have likely strengthened China's resolve to develop its own indigenous engine technology. (not investment advice)</p>

The prosecution built its case around suspicious actions, including Patterson disposing of a food dehydrator containing mushroom traces and lying to police about its existence. Other critical points included her false claim of having cancer to lure the victims to the meal and her use of a different plate than her guests. While the defense argued it was an accident and her lies were born of panic, the jury was ultimately convinced by the pattern of deception.</p>
