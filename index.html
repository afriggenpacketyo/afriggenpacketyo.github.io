          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his return to the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers, allowing one run in one inning against the San Diego Padres. This marked his first pitching appearance since undergoing elbow surgery in August 2023. Ohtani gave up singles to the first two batters before a sacrifice fly scored a run, but he managed to retire the next two batters. His fastball reached speeds of up to 100 miles per hour, and he is gradually increasing his workload after facing hitters in practice sessions. The game also marked his first time batting and pitching in the same game since his injury, showcasing his unique two-way abilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump cut short his visit to the Group of Seven summit in Canada, citing the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel as the reason for his early return to Washington. The White House emphasized that Trump had a productive day at the summit, including a trade deal between the US and UK, but he needed to address the situation in the Middle East. This decision meant Trump missed scheduled meetings with the Ukrainian President and the Mexican President-elect. Trump also posted on social media about Iran's nuclear ambitions, urging Iranians to evacuate Tehran, shortly before reports of explosions in the city.</p>

The shift aims to deepen ties and increase interoperability with allies and partners. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities. The country also seeks to develop its defense industrial base, which has been in poor condition due to reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. Increased arms exports would allow Japan to achieve economies of scale and make domestic production more viable.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump will return early to Washington from the G7 summit due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran. The White House press secretary stated that Trump would participate in the G7 family photo and dinner before departing. Trump's decision follows a series of developments in the Israel-Iran conflict, including his warning to residents of Tehran to evacuate. His early departure impacts discussions on the Middle East and a potential statement calling for de-escalation.</p>

The union said another of its members, a department assistant from the south coast of England, was inserting a cannula as part of a cancer procedure, when the patient's 19-year old daughter started filming on her phone.</p>
