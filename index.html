          <p>The debate over the health effects of seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, continues to generate public discussion. This article explores the conflicting viewpoints on the topic, highlighting claims from figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr., who has called them 'poison,' and contrasting them with the perspectives of many researchers. According to numerous scientific experts, the available evidence does not substantiate the widespread claims that these oils are inherently harmful.

          <p>Virginia Senator Mark Warner condemned what he termed an "outrageous" and explicit pressure campaign by the Trump administration that led to the resignation of University of Virginia President Jim Ryan. According to Warner, Ryan was threatened with significant funding cuts for research, financial aid, and employee salaries if he did not resign by a specific deadline. The pressure was reportedly linked to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Warner expressed grave concerns that this action sets a dangerous precedent for federal overreach into the governance of public universities and threatens academic freedom nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered Palestinians to evacuate several neighborhoods in northern Gaza, including parts of Gaza City and Jabalia, warning that its operations are set to intensify and expand. This directive comes as Israeli bombardments continue, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting at least 86 fatalities in a 24-hour period. Among the casualties were three children killed in a strike on al-Mawasi, an area previously designated as a safe zone. Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump is reportedly pushing for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, though negotiations remain stalled.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection, a decision that follows public attacks from President Trump.

In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating he preferred to spend time with his family rather than navigate another six years of "political theatre and partisan gridlock."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), using historical examples like World War II and the first Gulf War to contextualize the dispute over the effectiveness of recent U.S. strikes on Iran. It argues that preliminary assessments are often incomplete and that the true impact involves not just physical destruction but also functional and indirect effects. Given the use of advanced precision-guided munitions like the 15-ton GBU-57 bunker-busters and ideal delivery conditions, the author suggests the damage to Iran's nuclear program was likely severe and lasting, aligning more with White House claims than with early critical reports.</p>

          <p>According to a new assessment by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the budget bill championed by President Trump could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing healthcare coverage and add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The report specifies that the legislation includes approximately $1 trillion in cuts to healthcare funding, primarily affecting Medicaid. These findings are expected to complicate the bill's passage in the Senate, where Republicans are already facing opposition from within their own party over the legislation's fiscal and social impacts.</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump mentioned a group of "very wealthy people" are prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and suggested a deal could be finalized within weeks. The sale, which requires approval from the Chinese government, comes after Trump repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations, with the latest deadline set for September 17.</p>

          <p>A gold mine collapse in a government-controlled area of Sudan has resulted in the deaths of at least 11 miners, with seven others injured. The state-owned mining company reported that the incident occurred in an artisanal shaft that had previously been closed due to safety risks. Collapses are frequent in Sudan's artisanal mining sector, which suffers from poor safety standards. The gold mining industry is a significant source of funding for both sides in the country's ongoing and brutal civil war, with much of the gold reportedly being smuggled out of the country.</p>

          <p>Mexican boxing champion Kenia EnrÃ­quez has signed an exclusive, multi-fight contract with the mixed martial arts organization Combate Global, citing frustration with the World Boxing Council (WBC). EnrÃ­quez, who has held interim titles since 2017, accuses the WBC of failing to provide her an opportunity to unify her championship against the current titleholder, Gabriela Fundora. Feeling disrespected and stalled in her boxing career, the 31-year-old fighter has decided to transition to MMA, where she has already made a successful debut and feels she has found the support she lacked in boxing.</p>
