            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador and detained in a mega-prison, despite court rulings against the deportation. Van Hollen shared photos of the meeting, while El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele mocked social media speculation about Ábrego García's well-being. The White House criticized the visit, accusing Democrats of siding with an "illegal alien MS-13 terrorist," a claim denied by Ábrego García's lawyers. The senator did not offer an update on Mr. Ábrego García's status in his social media posts, but said more information would be released upon his return to the US.</p>

            <p>In Medford, Oregon, the disappearance of Aaron Friar and his daughter Ellie prompted a police investigation, with Ellie found alive and unharmed. Detective Bill Ford interviewed Russell Jones, Ellie's boyfriend's friend, who initially taunted investigators but requested a cigarette in exchange for information. Ford agreed, leading Jones to confess to helping load Aaron's body and directing police to the location where the body was hidden. Jones claimed he was not responsible for Aaron's death but cooperated in revealing the location in exchange for another cigarette.</p>

Vasquez Sura denied her husband's gang involvement and vowed to continue fighting for his return, while addressing a past protection order she filed against him.

            <p>The U.S. has reportedly presented allies with a peace plan for Russia and Ukraine, involving a ceasefire and a rollback of sanctions on Moscow, according to Bloomberg News. The proposal suggests freezing the conflict, with Russia maintaining control over occupied Ukrainian territories, and Ukraine not joining NATO. In return, Russia would see some sanctions eased, though EU approval is needed for lifting restrictions like unfreezing assets. The plan requires both Russia's agreement to cease fighting and security guarantees for Ukraine, and would need further discussion with Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Students at Florida State University returned to campus in shock after a shooting that killed two people and injured six others, allegedly committed by 20-year-old student Phoenix Ikner. Witnesses described harrowing scenes of barricading doors with desks, chairs, and even chewing gum to block windows. Ikner, the stepson of a sheriff’s deputy, reportedly used his stepmother’s former service weapon in the shooting and was a member of the sheriff’s office youth advisory council. Donald Trump called the shooting "terrible" but did not commit to new gun safety legislation, reiterating his support for the Second Amendment.</p>

            <p>Nintendo announced that retail preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 will begin on April 24, priced at $449.99, following a delay due to concerns over President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on Asian-manufactured goods. The company initially planned to launch preorders on April 9 but postponed the date to assess the impact of the tariffs, which impose a 145% tariff rate on China and a 10% rate on Vietnam. While the console's price remains unchanged, Nintendo warned that accessories may experience price adjustments. The Nintendo Switch 2 is slated for release on June 5, 2025.</p>

            <p>A man allegedly attempted to burn down Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence, citing Shapiro's perceived actions towards Palestinians, in what is being described as textbook anti-Semitism. The article argues that a campaign falsely blaming Shapiro for Israel's conduct, despite his support for Palestinian statehood and criticism of Netanyahu, contributed to the incident. The author contrasts this with the lack of similar campaigns against other politicians with similar views on Israel, suggesting a double standard rooted in anti-Jewish sentiment. The article concludes that such lies and double standards in the public sphere can have dangerous consequences.</p>

            <p>This article discusses Elon Musk's unconventional approach to fatherhood, characterized by numerous children with different mothers and legally binding contracts with nondisclosure clauses. The author argues that Musk's arrangements reduce family relationships to financial transactions, undermining traditional conservative views on the importance of family. The piece contrasts Musk's pro-natalist stance with traditional pro-family values, suggesting a shift in the Republican Party's understanding of family. It explores how Musk's wealth allows him to structure his familial relationships in a way that prioritizes reproduction over traditional bonds of care and responsibility.</p>

            <p>This article critiques the focus on the "diploma divide" in politics, arguing that it distracts from deeper issues of class and economic inequality. It suggests that emphasizing education as the primary political divide risks overlooking the economic interests of the working class and perpetuating a narrative of intelligence or achievement. The author contends that the Democratic party's focus on college-educated voters has alienated the working class, leading to a neglect of their economic grievances. The article concludes that progressives must address class grievances directly to regain political power.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is accused of using manufactured uncertainty to evade adverse court orders, particularly in immigration cases. By twisting the language of court orders and misrepresenting facts, the administration has delayed compliance, prompting judges to open investigations into potential deliberate defiance. This strategy reflects a maximalist interpretation of executive power and a belief that the Supreme Court will ultimately favor the administration's positions. The administration's actions have been met with rebukes from judges, who have expressed concern over the disregard for due process.</p>

            <p>Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is facing controversy over her welfare initiative, Hope Florida Foundation, due to a charity wing's failure to file tax documents and questions surrounding a $10 million donation directed to the charity. The scandal has angered some Florida Republicans, including the house speaker, Daniel Perez, and state representative Alex Andrade. This scandal could potentially derail her prospects for a gubernatorial run, testing her ability to handle negative publicity. Some observers believe the controversy has ended any hope she had of becoming only the second woman, after Wyoming’s Nellie Tayloe Ross in 1925, to succeed her husband as a state governor.</p>

Ábrego García had previously been granted protection from deportation due to potential persecution in El Salvador.
