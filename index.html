          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," via a post on his social media platform, X. He stated the party's goal is to restore freedom and challenge what he describes as a "one-party system" responsible for fiscal waste. The move follows Musk's public criticism of President Donald Trump's administration and a recent tax and spending bill passed by Congress. This announcement marks a significant step for the influential CEO into the formal political arena, introducing a new, unpredictable element to U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Kerr County, Texas, have stated they were caught by surprise by the deadly flash floods that occurred overnight on July 4th. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, leading to what officials described as a "catastrophic" event with at least 32 fatalities. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly explained that the county lacks a river warning system and that the severity of the rainfall was not anticipated by forecasts. The rapid and nocturnal nature of the flooding left residents with little to no time to evacuate to safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Yankees are facing a significant setback as starting pitcher Clarke Schmidt is expected to undergo Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career. This would sideline the 29-year-old for the rest of the current season and likely all of the next. Schmidt has been a key player for the team, holding a 3.32 ERA and recently setting a franchise record for consecutive scoreless innings. The injury adds to the team's mounting challenges, leaving their starting rotation in a precarious state during a difficult stretch of their season.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted raids in Southern California on the Fourth of July holiday, leading to multiple arrests and criticism from local officials. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were seen detaining workers at a car wash in West Hollywood and a food vendor in Eagle Rock. The actions have sparked protests and condemnation from community members and officials who called the timing on Independence Day a "troubling reminder of federal overreach." These raids are part of a larger operation that has resulted in over 1,600 arrests for deportation in the region.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has unilaterally stopped a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles, according to reports. Hegseth cited concerns about depleting U.S. weapons stockpiles, a claim that Democratic lawmakers argue is baseless and not supported by current data. This marks the third time Hegseth has paused aid, a decision that has surprised Congress and European allies. The halt in assistance comes as Russia intensifies its missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, making the delay particularly painful for Ukraine's defense efforts.</p>

This potential change in tactics represents a significant test for the team's defiant "no draws" mantra, established under coach Brendon McCullum.

Twain implemented the 100-year embargo to speak freely without causing immediate harm to those he criticized.

          <p>A Club World Cup quarterfinal match between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich was overshadowed by a horrific ankle injury to German star Jamal Musiala. The 22-year-old's foot was left at an unnatural angle after a collision with PSG's goalkeeper, stunning players and fans as he was stretchered off the field. PSG won the tense match 2-0, advancing to the semifinals, but the primary focus remained on the well-being of Musiala. The incident cast a somber mood over the game, which was held in Atlanta.</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 emergency personnel are battling two major wildfires in the eastern German states of Saxony and Thuringia following a severe heatwave. The fire in the Gohrischheide region, on the border of Saxony and Brandenburg, remains challenging, while the blaze in Thuringia has been stabilized. The Thuringian fire is being called the largest of its kind in the state in over 30 years. The fires broke out after temperatures reached up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), highlighting the increasing risk of wildfires in the region during extreme weather conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has faced strong criticism from Jewish groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" during a rally in Iowa. While discussing his new budget bill, Trump referred to some bankers as "Shylocks and bad people." The Anti-Defamation League called the use of the term, which evokes a centuries-old stereotype about Jewish greed from Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," both "troubling and irresponsible." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware the term was considered offensive and believed it simply meant a moneylender who charges high rates.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ for creating the concept of a "citizen." He emphasized that the nation's founding was a bloody civil war, and understanding its complexity and divisions makes its ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that history is a lifeline, and the Revolution teaches that even in deeply divided times, progress is possible. He stressed that a citizen's obligation is to engage in lifelong learning to sustain the republic, rather than succumbing to anger and distrust.</p>

          <p>An analysis exploring the U.S. tax system reveals that the primary disparity between the wealthy and the middle class lies not in tax rates but in how income is taxed. While the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, they benefit from strategies that favor wealth over work. Billionaires primarily generate wealth through investments, which are only taxed upon sale, unlike wages which are taxed immediately. A key strategy known as "buy-borrow-die" allows them to live off tax-free loans against their assets and pass them to heirs with minimal tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing backlash for sending an email that critics call misleading, claiming President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal taxes on benefits for most recipients. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have labeled the email a "lie" and a partisan political statement. The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors, which phases out for higher-income individuals. Critics argue the communication from the typically apolitical agency misrepresents the legislation's actual impact on seniors' finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A focus group of 2024 Labour voters from Kent, England, has revealed a strong sense of disappointment with the party's first year in power. Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, particularly regarding immigration, and noted the government's frequent policy U-turns. While some felt the government needed more time to "steady the ship," others said they felt "lied to." The sentiment reflects a souring relationship between the party and the public, with some voters indicating they would consider supporting the rival Reform UK party in a future election.</p>

          <p>An analytical article highlights growing concerns over President Trump's recent threats of retribution against political opponents and critics, including Elon Musk and prospective NYC mayor Zohran Mamdani. The piece argues that these warnings, which include threats of deportation, arrest, and loss of citizenship, represent a significant assault on constitutional norms and freedom of speech. Pro-democracy campaigners warn that even if the threats are not acted upon, they create a chilling effect designed to make citizens fear opposing the president. This pattern of behavior is seen as a serious attack on the foundations of American freedom.</p>
