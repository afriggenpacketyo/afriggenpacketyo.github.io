          <p>Dozens of Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a new congressional map. The GOP's proposed redistricting plan, backed by Donald Trump, aims to create several new Republican-leaning seats, which could help secure their U.S. House majority. Democrats argue they are fighting a racist and politically motivated gerrymander, while the Texas governor has threatened them with arrest upon their return.</p>

          <p>An amber weather warning has been issued across much of Scotland and other parts of the UK as Storm Floris is expected to bring high winds and significant travel disruption. Authorities are warning of a potential "danger to life," with train and ferry services already being canceled in anticipation of gusts reaching up to 70mph. Officials have urged the public to plan ahead and avoid unnecessary risks during this unseasonably powerful August storm.</p>

          <p>In a significant conciliatory move, South Korea's military has begun physically removing the loudspeakers used to broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across its border with North Korea. This action follows an earlier decision by the new liberal government to halt the broadcasts as part of a broader effort to reduce tensions and rebuild dialogue with Pyongyang. The gesture aims to foster trust after years of heightened animosity on the Korean Peninsula.</p>

          <p>With diplomatic negotiations seemingly stalled, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly pushing for a "military solution" to free the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This approach suggests a potential expansion of military operations aimed at forcibly extracting the captives. The shift in strategy comes amid growing public pressure from hostage families who are demanding their loved ones' immediate and safe return.</p>

A single cycle of egg retrieval, freezing, and storage costs an average of $12,000 to $13,000, and doctors often recommend multiple cycles to improve the chances of a future successful pregnancy. Since most women lack insurance coverage for the procedure, the high price remains a major barrier.</p>

          <p>Google's AI research lab, DeepMind, has demonstrated a remarkable new model called Genie 2 that can generate an interactive, 3D video-game world from a single static image. This technology allows a user or another AI to navigate and explore a dynamic environment that the model creates in real-time. Beyond entertainment, researchers state the primary goal is to build a "world model" that can be used to train robots in a near-infinite variety of simulated scenarios.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs warned that the United States' increasingly hostile posture toward China could create a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. He described the ongoing trade war as a U.S.-led initiative and suggested China should pivot its economic focus toward developing nations rather than trying to appease the West. Sachs also stressed China's crucial role in the global transition to sustainable energy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in centuries, the Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted, just days after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake shook the region. The eruption sent a large ash plume into the atmosphere, triggering an aviation alert, though no immediate threat to populated areas was reported. Scientists believe the massive quake may have acted as a trigger for the eruption, shaking the volcano's subterranean magma system.</p>
