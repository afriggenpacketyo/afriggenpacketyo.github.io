          <p>A Brazilian court has ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid an investigation into an alleged coup plot. The restrictions, which also bar him from social media and contact with other defendants, were imposed over fears he might flee the country. Bolsonaro, who denies the accusations of trying to overturn the 2023 election results, has called the measures a "supreme humiliation." The case has also drawn attention from the U.S., with former President Trump criticizing the prosecution as a politically motivated witch hunt.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the closure of its primary scientific research division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). This move is expected to impact over 1,500 employees, including many leading scientists, and is part of a broader agency reorganization aimed at cutting costs. The EPA stated the elimination of the ORD will save nearly $750 million, but critics and former officials warn it dismantles a respected research organization. The decision leaves many employees uncertain about their future and has been described as dangerous to public health and environmental protection.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The incident occurred Friday morning at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy in East Los Angeles. The deceased deputies, identified as members of the elite Arson Explosives Detail, were reportedly working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered the previous day. Sheriff Robert Luna described the event as the department's largest loss of life since 1857, and federal agencies including the ATF and FBI are assisting in the investigation.</p>

          <p>China's top disciplinary commission is using a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prominent example of wasteful local government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City" was an ambitious health tourism initiative that collapsed due to a broken capital chain and poor decision-making, leaving multiple buildings abandoned. Initially planned with a 1.65 billion yuan investment, the project is now a cautionary tale for cadres nationwide. The official who championed the project was expelled from the Communist Party after being found guilty of misappropriating funds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at China's Army Engineering University have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic railgun that could nearly double the weapon's firing power. The proposed "X-railgun" involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would allow it to fire heavier projectiles at extreme speeds. This innovation aims to overcome the power limitations of the current naval railgun, which was first mounted on a ship in 2018. The new design could enable shells of up to 30kg to be fired at Mach 7, significantly enhancing its potential military applications.</p>

The move aligns with Russia's broader strategy to reduce dependence on foreign technology and promote state-backed alternatives like the new "MAX" messaging app. This follows a presidential order to restrict software from "unfriendly countries" and comes as lawmakers propose fines for accessing banned platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

An ICE official stated that the U.S. obtained assurances from the Maduro regime that it would not obstruct the travel of any former detainee needed for legal proceedings in the United States.

          <p>A state audit has found that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing. The report revealed a 32% vacancy rate in the last fiscal year, which has crippled the agency's ability to conduct timely inspections and address workplace hazards effectively. The audit noted that overstretched inspectors have closed cases without on-site visits and that documentation of violations was often lacking. Labor advocates argue that chronic understaffing has left California's 19 million workers vulnerable to irresponsible employers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation specifically targets the $250 billion stablecoin market, establishing consumer protections and clear legal definitions for digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The law allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move hailed by the administration and crypto industry as a critical step toward integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system.

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenized assets. The rise of stablecoins and other digital tokens poses significant new challenges to existing infrastructures for payment, clearing, and settlement. According to the adviser, the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of these instruments complicates efforts like anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer regulations, necessitating a proactive global policy debate.

          <p>A Nashville judge has ruled that Tennessee prison officials must deactivate a death-row inmate's implanted heart device just before his execution. The ruling addresses the risk that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) could deliver painful electric shocks in an attempt to restart the inmate's heart as the lethal injection is administered. The inmate's attorneys argued this would amount to torture, while the state contended it was unlikely and that the inmate would be unconscious. The order requires medical professionals to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution.</p>

While many people view wasps as a nuisance at picnics and in beer gardens, entomologists emphasize their crucial role in the ecosystem. As apex predators, wasps provide a free and natural form of pest control for gardens and farms. To coexist peacefully, the public is advised to avoid swatting at them and can distract them by leaving a small amount of a sugary substance nearby.</p>
