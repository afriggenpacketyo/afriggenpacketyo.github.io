          <p>Following the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, President Trump suggested that television networks critical of him should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. His comments came after ABC pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely due to a monologue where Kimmel linked the suspected killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had threatened action against the network, raising concerns among legal scholars about First Amendment protections and government overreach into media content.</p>

          <p>A source familiar with a House Oversight Committee interview stated that Hunter Biden was involved in discussions regarding presidential pardons during the end of his father's term. The information emerged from a closed-door testimony by Jeff Zients, a former Biden administration official, as part of an investigation into the use of an autopen for executive decisions. According to the source, Hunter attended some meetings on the subject with White House aides, though the extent of his influence remains unclear, including any involvement in discussions about his own pardon.</p>

          <p>Legendary late-night host David Letterman has condemned ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" as "ridiculous" and a move toward "managed media." Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, Letterman argued that media companies should not fire someone out of fear or to appease a political administration. He compared the situation to CBS's recent cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," suggesting both actions were politically motivated to avoid conflict with President Trump. Letterman stated he has been in contact with Kimmel, who he says is doing fine.</p>

          <p>A major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck near the east coast of Russia's remote Kamchatka region, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake's epicenter was located approximately 127 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 19.5 kilometers. While the Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a brief tsunami threat, it was later lifted, and there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.

          <p>First Amendment scholars are raising concerns that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may have engaged in illegal "jawboning," or censorship by proxy, by pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show. The controversy began after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr publicly stated the network should take action against Kimmel for his remarks about the killing of Charlie Kirk, implying regulatory consequences. Legal experts argue this creates a direct link between government coercion and the suppression of constitutionally protected speech, setting a dangerous precedent that could have a chilling effect on media criticism of the government.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has been assigned a U.S. Secret Service protective detail, according to multiple sources. This security enhancement comes after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which has heightened concerns about the safety of high-profile public figures. While it is uncommon for a press secretary to have a dedicated security detail, it is not without precedent. The move coincides with Congress considering additional funding to increase security for officials in both the executive and judicial branches of government.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are on track to achieve a historic milestone, surpassing 4 million in total attendance for the first time in the franchise's history. The team, which has led Major League Baseball in attendance every year since 2013, will officially cross the threshold during its final regular-season game. This achievement places them in an exclusive group of teams to have reached this figure, a feat made possible by Dodger Stadium's large capacity. The sustained success on the field, combined with a star-studded roster, has been a major driver of the record-breaking fan support.</p>

          <p>A new Los Angeles County policy is drawing criticism from oversight officials and civil rights advocates who claim it is an attempt to muzzle their independent voices. The rule requires watchdog commissions, such as those overseeing the county jails and the Sheriff's Department, to get prior approval from a county executive office for all public communications, including press releases and social media posts. While the county states the policy is to ensure unified messaging, critics argue it is a restrictive measure intended to control narratives and limit public criticism of county agencies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic approach marks a significant departure from traditional Republican pro-market principles, embracing a form of "state capitalism" that involves direct government intervention. Policies such as imposing tariffs, taking an equity stake in Intel, and negotiating revenue cuts from chip sales to China contrast sharply with the party's historical focus on free markets and predictable rules. This transactional, "Daddy State" doctrine creates profound uncertainty and encourages corporate lobbying over innovation, potentially eroding institutional trust and slowing long-term economic dynamism.
