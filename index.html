          <p>Russia launched one of its largest air attacks of the war, deploying over 500 drones and missiles against Ukraine. In the effort to repel the assault, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was lost and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, was killed after reportedly shooting down seven targets. Despite the loss, Ukrainian air defenses, aided by F-16s, successfully intercepted a majority of the incoming projectiles, prompting President Zelenskyy to reiterate urgent calls for more Western air defense systems.</p>

          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey, Michael Testa, has introduced legislation to officially rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal, which would require state agencies to update all materials, appears to be inspired by a Trump administration order that renamed part of the Gulf of Mexico. Testa, who represents a district bordering the bay, argued that New Jersey's significant commercial and recreational fishing industries justify the name change for the vital body of water.</p>

          <p>This article details the murder trial of Samuel Woodward, who was found guilty of the first-degree, hate-crime murder of his 19-year-old former classmate, Blaze Bernstein, in 2018. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, a member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, targeted Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. After a six-year legal process, Woodward was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole, bringing a painful legal chapter to a close for Bernstein's family.</p>
