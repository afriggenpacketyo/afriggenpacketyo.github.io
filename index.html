          <h2>Japan Considers Increasing Rice Stockpile Release to Curb Price Increases</h2>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its rice reserves to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices, which have reached near-record highs due to supply shortages. This measure involves releasing 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned off. However, this substantial release could reduce the stockpile to a level that raises concerns about the government's ability to respond to future harvest failures. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian representatives are meeting in Istanbul for the first direct talks since the early weeks of the conflict, although Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be in attendance. The return to Istanbul is significant as the city hosted previous diplomatic efforts, including the Istanbul Communiqué in 2022, which outlined a potential peace agreement. While President Trump has expressed optimism and hinted at his possible involvement, analysts remain cautious about the likelihood of an immediate breakthrough, as both sides maneuver to avoid blame for potential failures in the negotiation process. The U.S. delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio. </p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analyst forecasts. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth primarily to the UK services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, shadow chancellor Mel Stride cautioned that growth forecasts for the year have been downgraded by both the Office for Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund. </p>

          <p>Children with hearing impairments in Kosovo struggle in school due to limited resources and institutional support, with some parents hesitant to teach them sign language over fears it will impede speech development. Many deaf individuals in Kosovo find sign language to be the most effective communication method, but its limited use leads to reliance on writing, gestures, and technology. This exclusion can result in anxiety, low self-confidence, and frustration, further hindering their integration into the labor market. Despite efforts to improve education for deaf students, a concrete plan to integrate sign language into the curriculum is still lacking. </p>

A parliamentary committee deemed the haka potentially intimidating to other lawmakers, recommending suspensions for Maipi-Clarke and Te Pāti Māori co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that spending time in nature can aid in recovery from physical injuries, as illustrated by Sarah Allely's experience of reduced pain after a brain injury when she started taking walks in the bush. Studies indicate that nature can help reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and even brief exposure to natural environments can lower pain levels. Experts explain that nature provides a softer form of attention that requires fewer mental resources, allowing the brain to rest and promote emotional well-being, which in turn positively impacts physical recovery. This highlights the potential benefits of incorporating nature into rehabilitation and daily life. </p>

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved legislation that enhances legal protections for police officers, setting new legal standards for the use of force and providing for immunity hearings. Republicans argue the bill supports law enforcement, while Democrats claim it could lead to excessive force against Black individuals. The bill allows an immunity hearing to determine if an officer acted recklessly outside their duties, and requires law enforcement departments to collect data on use-of-force complaints. Critics fear the bill could embolden misconduct. </p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, largely attributed to pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not anticipated to be a major factor, according to the IMF. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system where most of the value comes from intellectual property, with manufacturing contracted to other countries. The U.S. is a key trading partner, but only 3% of total exports are produced in Denmark and pass through customs, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs. </p>

          <p>What was thought to be a copy of the Magna Carta at Harvard Law School is in fact an extremely rare original from among seven surviving versions of the document issued by English King Edward I in 1300, British experts said on Thursday. The "Great Charter," the first extant expression in writing of the principle that a king and his government are not above the law, originally dates from June 1215, when it was signed by King John.

The charity said that some deprived areas around Birkenhead at the time had "tribal" and "tight-knit" communities that made it difficult for people to come forward.
