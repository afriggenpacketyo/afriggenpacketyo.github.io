          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House for a crucial summit aimed at ending the war with Russia. Trump has publicly suggested that Zelenskyy can end the conflict "almost immediately," implying Ukraine should accept territorial concessions, including forgoing Crimea and its ambitions to join NATO. This meeting follows discussions between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where Putin reportedly demanded Ukraine cede its eastern Donbas region for a peace deal. European leaders are attending to support Zelenskyy and defend the continent's security interests amidst the high-stakes negotiations.</p>

          <p>Air Canada's fleet remains grounded after its 10,000 unionized flight attendants defied a government labor board order to end their strike and enter binding arbitration. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) has called the order unconstitutional and is urging the airline to resume negotiations for a fair contract. The primary dispute centers on wages and compensation for ground duties, such as passenger boarding, for which attendants are not currently paid. The unprecedented defiance has escalated the standoff, leaving thousands of passengers stranded and prompting the Canadian government to consider legal enforcement or special legislation.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated his belief that the artificial intelligence market is currently in a bubble, drawing parallels to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. He noted that while investors are "overexcited," he also affirms that AI remains one of the most significant technological developments in recent history. His comments align with growing concerns from other financial experts who have warned that the rapid surge in AI-related investment may be outpacing fundamental value. Despite these concerns and the company's unprofitability, OpenAI is reportedly preparing a secondary stock sale that would value it at approximately $500 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Union diplomats in Beijing are reportedly discussing a collective boycott of China's upcoming major military parade, scheduled to commemorate the end of World War II. The primary concern among the envoys is the confirmed attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, which is seen as highly problematic amid Moscow's intensified aggression in Ukraine. According to sources, some European missions are conflicted about being present at an event that may also feature Russian troops who participated in the invasion. The potential boycott highlights the diplomatic friction between Europe and the Russia-China partnership as the war in Ukraine continues.</p>

The five-year, $400 million project involves replacing three major bridges, widening I-195, and reconstructing several local streets and sidewalks to improve safety and accessibility. To establish a safe work zone, various ramp and street closures will be implemented as needed over the next week. The project also includes the development of a new landscaped park with a shared-use path and skate park beneath the interchange.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump, has publicly called for India to cease its purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the practice as "opportunistic." In an op-ed, Navarro argued that India is undermining international sanctions by acting as a "global clearinghouse" for Russian oil, thereby providing Moscow with essential revenue. His comments follow reports of canceled trade talks and the Trump administration's plan to impose an additional 25% tariff on India over the issue. India has defended its imports as a necessity driven by market conditions, pointing out that Western nations also continue to trade with Russia.</p>

The move comes as the company's stock has surged over the past year, driven by strong investor interest in China's domestic AI sector. This capital injection supports Beijing's broader goal of achieving technological self-sufficiency, especially as publicly owned computing hubs are mandated to source more chips from local producers.

This initiative is part of the European Union's "Vision Zero" program, which aims to virtually eliminate road fatalities by 2050.

The piece references an investigation by +972 Magazine about an Israeli military unit tasked with discrediting reporters by labeling them as militants.

The study, published in Cell Stem Cell, found that the grafted cells helped reduce symptoms like anxiety and anhedonia—the inability to feel pleasure—in the mice. This breakthrough provides proof-of-concept for using cell therapy to treat neuropsychiatric disorders by directly reconstructing and repairing dysfunctional neural circuits in the brain. The development could pave the way for new treatments for major depressive disorder, which affects hundreds of millions globally and is often resistant to conventional therapies.</p>

          <p>On the eve of a critical meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that the responsibility to end the war lies with the Ukrainian leader. In a social media post, Trump claimed Zelenskyy could end the conflict "almost immediately" if he chooses, while also mirroring Russian demands that Ukraine must not join NATO and must accept Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. These comments reinforce the pressure on Zelenskyy to consider significant concessions as part of a U.S.-brokered peace deal, a stance that has caused concern among European allies who will also be present at the Washington talks.</p>

          <h2>Trump Declares Ukraine Will Not Join NATO as Part of Any Peace Agreement</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has explicitly stated that Ukraine will not be permitted to join NATO as part of any potential peace deal to end the war with Russia. In a social media post just before hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, Trump also asserted that Ukraine would not regain the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. These remarks align with long-standing Kremlin demands and signal a significant shift in U.S. policy, placing immense pressure on Zelenskyy to accept these terms. European leaders are joining the talks, reportedly concerned that Trump may push Ukraine into an unfavorable agreement.</p>
