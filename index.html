        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are divided on whether Alex Murdaugh will receive a new murder trial following the indictment of former court clerk Becky Hill on charges including obstructing justice and perjury. While some, like former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, believe the charges weaken Murdaugh's appeal, others, such as attorney Eric Bland, argue the optics favor Murdaugh. The charges against Hill do not include jury tampering, which was a central argument in Murdaugh's appeal for a retrial. Murdaugh's attorneys assert the charges underscore the need for a fair trial, though he would still serve a life sentence for financial crimes even if the murder conviction were overturned.</p>

          <p>The annual Sunday Times rich list highlights the extreme wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, with the gap between the rich and the average person tripling since 1989. The article argues that wealth accumulation, often through passive returns on existing assets, exacerbates inequality. It proposes establishing an 'extreme wealth line' to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful to society, influencing politics, the environment, and economic competition. The author suggests that policymakers should consider measures such as higher taxes or mandatory charitable donations for wealth exceeding this line to curb the excesses of wealth inequality.</p>

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is cracking down on illegal immigration at the border with Austria, implementing stricter controls and turning back asylum-seekers who don't meet specific vulnerability criteria. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt emphasized the government's commitment to stopping criminal activities related to people smuggling and highlighted a significant increase in thwarted illegal entry attempts. This policy shift represents a departure from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum policy and aims to address concerns raised by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). However, neighboring countries like Poland have expressed reservations about the new approach, preferring to focus on combating illegal immigration at the EU's external borders.</p>

Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas.

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a complex and evolving set of tariffs on various countries and industries, with many initially proposed tariffs being either paused or modified. Tariffs currently in effect include a 10% universal tariff, 25% on cars and auto parts (with exceptions), 30% on Chinese imports (with exceptions), and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered in the USMCA. Tariffs that have been paused include 'reciprocal' tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods. Key exemptions have been made for goods covered in the USMCA and certain electronics imported from China. Trump continues to threaten additional tariffs on specific industries, but the future of these measures remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Two countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Haiti and St Lucia, sent delegations to a high-level forum in Beijing, highlighting mainland China's flexible approach to courting Taipei's remaining official partners. According to analysts, this suggests Beijing has adopted a more pragmatic approach in dealing with countries that recognize Taiwan, and that participation in the event does not necessarily indicate a shift in allegiance. Taiwan's foreign ministry said the two countries had notified it in advance that their officials would attend and that relations remained 'friendly and stable.'</p>

          <p>Automatic gunfire was heard in central Gaza early Saturday, hours after the Israeli military announced its forces had begun mobilizing for a broader plan to advance further into the territory. The gunfire followed intense Israeli bombardment overnight, prompting some civilians on the eastern edge of the city to flee westward. Mediators are seeking to broker a new temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, who have been at war since October 2023. Despite the immense toll of Israelâ€™s military campaign, the fighting has failed to either decisively defeat Hamas or force the group to free all the hostages.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election with the outcome determining whether the pro-European government led by Donald Tusk can proceed with its reform plans, which have been blocked by the current conservative president. The two front-runners are Rafal Trzaskowski, a left-wing liberal backed by Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, a historian supported by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party. The election is seen as a referendum on the government's ability to implement its agenda, which includes restoring the rule of law, liberalizing abortion legislation, and introducing more rights for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani hit his MLB-leading 16th home run in the game, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Angels' lead.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that supporters of President Donald Trump claimed was a veiled threat on the president's life. The post showed seashells arranged to form the shapes '86 47,' which some interpreted as a call to assassinate the 47th president. Comey said he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post. Despite his explanation, Trump and top administration officials rejected Comey's defense and called for further investigation.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent gang, citing concerns over due process. The justices sent the case back to an appeals court to examine claims that the migrants could not be legally deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling underscored the treacherous balancing act that Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to pull off with a narrow majority: Changes to win the backing of conservatives could alienate the more moderate Republicans. The legislation as currently written would cut taxes, while providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement, while cutting health, nutrition and education to pay for it.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, reducing visibility to near zero and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has issued such a warning and the first time including the city itself.

Residents described the event as something out of the history books, with skies clearing up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas affected.</p>
