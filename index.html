            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed concerns about the weakening U.S. economy, suggesting it may already be in a recession due to the uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs. Fink noted that while some economic data, like job growth, appear strong, consumer and business sentiment surveys indicate a slowdown. He believes consumers may have been stocking up on goods ahead of tariffs, masking underlying economic weakness. Despite these concerns, Fink does not foresee a financial crisis and expects long-term economic trends like artificial intelligence to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Vox report highlights how the poultry industry's genetic alterations to chickens, aimed at maximizing growth and efficiency, have resulted in severe animal welfare issues. Chickens are bred to grow rapidly and have larger breasts, leading to lameness, heart failure, and premature death, with a significant percentage dying on farms before slaughter. While consumers may be aware of cruel factory farming practices, the impact of genetics remains largely invisible. The article suggests that addressing genetics is crucial to reducing the suffering of billions of animals on factory farms.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, must be returned to the U.S. The court declined to block a lower court's order to facilitate his return, though it questioned the judge's authority. The Trump administration had appealed the order, but now must explain its steps to bring Garcia back. Garcia's lawyers have accused the government of delaying and flouting court orders.</p>
