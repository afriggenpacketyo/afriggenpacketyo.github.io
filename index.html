            <p>Singapore has announced a general election to be held on May 3rd, with parliament dissolved by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Nomination Day is set for April 23rd, followed by nine days of campaigning and a cooling-off day. This election marks Lawrence Wong's first as prime minister, succeeding Lee Hsien Loong, amid voter concerns over cost of living and unemployment. The ruling People's Action Party, in power since 1965, is expected to face challenges for all 97 parliamentary seats in a landscape of heightened global economic uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Prince William and Kate Middleton are reportedly in disagreement over the future schooling of their eldest son, Prince George, who is second in line to the British throne. Kate is said to favor a less traditional, co-educational environment like Marlborough College, while William prefers Eton College, his alma mater. Experts suggest Kate aims to avoid the bullying she experienced in her youth, while William values the traditional royal education and proximity to Windsor. The decision reflects the ongoing balancing act between royal tradition and modernizing the monarchy.</p>

            <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening as job vacancies have fallen to a near four-year low, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While average pay continues to rise, increasing employment costs are impacting hiring decisions. The number of workers on payrolls has also declined, leading to concerns about future economic slowdown.

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off amidst market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs, leading to a spike in Treasury yields. This outflow of safe-haven assets during a time of uncertainty has prompted speculation about who was selling. Potential sellers include China, facing pressure to devalue the yuan, and Japanese life insurers, seeking to reduce exposure to U.S. policy uncertainty. Hedge funds and European pension accounts might also be involved in shifting investments. (not investment advice)</p>

The debate reignited after a concert in Texcoco ended in a brawl when a singer refused to perform narcocorridos due to local regulations. Attempts to ban the music have existed for decades, with experts questioning their effectiveness and attributing the recent surge in prohibitionist sentiment to political demagoguery.</p>
