          <p>The G7 summit concluded with statements on AI and critical minerals, but without a unified statement on Ukraine. According to an unnamed Canadian official, the US delegation watered down the language condemning Russia, undermining the group's ability to negotiate. The other six member countries opted to reflect the statement's contents in a statement issued by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump has repeatedly declined to blame Russia for invading Ukraine, claiming G7 members were responsible for expelling Russia in 2014. The US stance prevented a strong, unified message against Russian aggression.</p>

The White House stated this extension will be used to ensure a deal is closed to protect American users' data. The previous agreement was stalled due to trade issues with China, and any deal requires Chinese government approval. Congress has been largely silent on the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering adjustments to the tax bill, a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda, potentially setting up a clash with the House. The Senate Finance Committee released the legislative text, addressing Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. The Senate version maintains the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, which is a point of contention for House Republicans. Both chambers face narrow majorities and a July 4 deadline to pass the bill.</p>

This chip is a product of Amazon's Annapurna Labs and a win for the company's custom strategy, challenging traditional semiconductor players like Intel and AMD. The real battle is with Nvidia in the AI infrastructure space, with AWS looking to reduce AI training costs and provide an alternative to Nvidia's expensive GPUs. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model launched on Trainium2 GPUs, according to AWS, and Project Rainier is powered by over half a million of the chips – an order that would have traditionally gone to Nvidia.</p>
