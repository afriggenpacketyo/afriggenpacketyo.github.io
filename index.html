            <p>China's Commerce Ministry is urging the U.S. to completely abolish reciprocal tariffs, deeming recent U.S. tariff exemptions a "small step." The ministry emphasized the need for equal dialogue based on mutual respect to resolve differences, while also evaluating the impact of the tariff exemptions on tech products. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated there are currently no plans for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to communicate directly on the issue, which China views as a retreat by the U.S. government and evidence that Chinese supply chains are difficult to replace.

            <p>Clinical psychologist Diana Hill and movement specialist Katy Bowman suggest retraining the brain to crave physical activity for stress relief rather than resorting to phone scrolling. Using the concept of psychological flexibility, individuals can learn to open up to uncomfortable emotions and take value-oriented action, like moving more. Strategies include surfing the urge to scroll, savoring favorite activities, and transforming worry into compassionate action. By choosing movement, individuals can boost their mood, reduce fatigue, and improve concentration.</p>

            <p>Global trade networks are facing disruption due to President Trump's tariffs, as companies scramble to adjust supply chains and avoid higher costs. The decision to pause tariffs for countries other than China has provided some relief, but uncertainty remains, impacting shipping rates and port congestion. Companies are considering alternative sourcing locations and re-routing products, while ports are preparing for potential congestion and shifts in trade flows. The introduction of tariffs comes at a particularly tricky time for many U.S. importers, which traditionally finalize annual long-term shipping contracts with carriers in March and April, to come into force on 1 May.</p>
