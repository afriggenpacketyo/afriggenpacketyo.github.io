            <p>Three former Department of Defense aides, recently dismissed amid leak concerns, have publicly questioned their abrupt termination, stating they received minimal information about the investigation. The aides, military veterans, expressed disappointment and refuted claims of character defamation by unnamed Pentagon officials. They emphasized their commitment to information security and support for the Trump-Vance Administration's mission, while one is consulting legal counsel. The aides are unsure what they were being investigated for, if there was an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of leaks to begin with.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders". The IDF claimed troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, citing poor night visibility and a failure to identify the vehicles as ambulances. A deputy commander has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The Red Crescent and other international organizations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident after video footage showed the clearly marked ambulances with lights on and their emergency signals flashing.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" start to economic activity followed by a slowdown in the summer. Businesses are stocking up on inventory and consumers are panic buying in anticipation of the tariffs, which could inflate economic activity in April before a potential slump. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook, but cautioned about uncertainty surrounding the tariffs. Sectors like the auto industry are likely to stockpile inventory before import levies potentially rise. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed the front line had been hit by more than 46 Russian assaults since the start of the day on Sunday. In response, Russia's defence ministry said it had "repelled" attempted assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells, according to state media sources. Zelensky dismissed Putin's declaration as a "PR" exercise, while Russia insisted its troops had "strictly observed the ceasefire".</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that his trip to El Salvador was to support Kilmar Ábrego García’s right to due process, which he believes is essential for protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans. He criticized the White House's claims about Ábrego García's gang affiliation, demanding evidence in court. Van Hollen accused the Trump administration of flouting court orders and creating a constitutional crisis by denying Ábrego García's rights. He also refuted claims that his meeting with García was a trap, emphasizing his goal was to ensure his well-being.</p>

The president and the market both agree on the need for a more efficient and streamlined process for attracting high-net-worth immigrants.</p>

Israel at first claimed that the medics' vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked. The military investigation found that the deputy battalion commander, "due to poor night visibility," assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants, however footage from the incident shows the ambulances had lights flashing and logos visible. Palestinians and international human rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel's military of failing to properly investigate or whitewashing misconduct by its troops.</p>

While media and economists often focus on metrics like consumer sentiment and GDP, the author argues these are often contradictory and unreliable. Instead, the author suggests looking at actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital, and labor, such as Walmart, major banks, and payroll companies like Paychex, to get a more accurate picture of the economy's health.
