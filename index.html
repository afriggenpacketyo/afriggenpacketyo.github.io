          <p>Tennis legend Bjorn Borg recently opened up about his "extremely aggressive" prostate cancer diagnosis from 2023, revealing he now takes life "day by day, year by year." The 69-year-old, a winner of 11 Grand Slam titles including five Wimbledons, is in remission after 2024 surgery but faces a continuous battle with "sleeping cancer cells" and undergoes bi-annual tests, acknowledging the significant psychological impact of the disease, which often presents without symptoms. Borg also reflected on his iconic rivalry with John McEnroe, particularly the memorable 1980 Wimbledon final, which he considers his most satisfying match. Their intense on-court competition has since evolved into a strong friendship, with both legends now discussing contemporary tennis rather than past glories, highlighting personal resilience.</p>

          <p>Four men have been released on conditional bail following their arrest for projecting images of Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle walls. This protest, which also included quotes and headlines about their relationship, took place ahead of Trump's state visit to the UK, coinciding with public and political debate over his presence and past. The individuals, aged 36 to 60, were held on suspicion of offenses like malicious communications and public nuisance, underscoring the strong sentiments surrounding the visit. This incident highlights the ongoing public dissent and scrutiny surrounding the US president's controversial past associations, as Thames Valley Police continue their investigation into the matter.</p>

This high-value experience, including pre-dinner champagne and a private tour at Singapore's National Gallery, was a key part of the museum's 10th-anniversary gala, which successfully raised over SG$2.8 million. The funds are designated to advance the Gallery's mission of making art accessible to all, supporting new exhibitions, curatorial research, and community engagement programs.

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in US investment, projected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major firms like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google are pledging significant funds over the next decade, aiming to deepen economic ties between the two nations and support key sectors like life sciences and advanced manufacturing. This comes as some pharmaceutical companies have paused UK investments due to perceived challenges, and domestic businesses face slowing investment amid rising costs. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the commitments as a testament to Britain's economic strength, despite some critics calling the investment "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table."

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood vowed to fight "vexatious, last-minute claims," asserting that migrants claiming modern slavery on the eve of removal make a "mockery of our laws." However, the UK's independent anti-slavery commissioner expressed deep concern, stating there's no evidence of system abuse and that such government rhetoric puts vulnerable lives at risk. This legal challenge, the first against the scheme, raises significant questions about its enforceability and effectiveness in curbing small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK includes a mix of ceremonial duties and critical business discussions, despite tradition not usually extending such an invitation to a second-term president. After spending Wednesday with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, Trump is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers for trade and geopolitical talks, focusing on economic prosperity and global conflicts. The agenda for Thursday includes viewing the Sir Winston Churchill archives, a private meeting, a business reception, and a joint news conference. The visit, while marked by pageantry and royal engagements, also faces protests in London and Windsor, highlighting the complex reception for the US president.</p>

          <p>The Italian protest song "Bella Ciao," a global symbol of resistance against oppression, has gained renewed attention after its phrase was found etched on a bullet casing linked to Charlie Kirk's alleged killer. While its connection to the murder remains unconfirmed, the article delves into the song's divergent origins, from Italian rice paddy workers' protests against harsh labor conditions to its widespread adoption as an anti-fascist anthem. Its melodic simplicity and adaptability have allowed it to be repurposed by various movements, including feminist and climate activists, and even achieve pop culture fame through "Money Heist." This enduring melody continues to serve as a powerful "portable monument" of memory and struggle across diverse contexts, transcending ideologies.</p>

          <p>EU environment ministers are struggling to agree on a new emissions-cutting plan, making it likely the bloc will attend an upcoming UN climate summit without updated targets. A European Commission proposal to cut emissions by 90% by 2040 faces significant opposition from several member states, including Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, who fear it is too ambitious and would damage their economies. Security and defense concerns, alongside economic problems stemming from Chinese competition and US tariffs, are currently sidelining urgent climate action, despite the EU's established goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Ministers now aim for a "statement of intent" instead of a firm plan, highlighting deep internal divisions on environmental policy.</p>

While not expected to directly impact the US, it may cause high surf and dangerous rip currents on the East Coast and eastern Caribbean islands. This development breaks a rare lull, as September typically sees high tropical activity, despite this year's Atlantic basin experiencing dry, stable air and stronger wind shear that have hindered storm formation.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, plan to present photographic and scientific evidence in a US court to prove Mrs. Macron is a woman. Their lawyer, Tom Clare, stated this will occur in a defamation suit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has repeatedly promoted the belief that Brigitte Macron was born male. Mrs. Macron found the claims "incredibly upsetting" and is prepared for the "unpleasantness and discomfort" of publicly presenting proof to set the record straight, emphasizing her firm resolve. This legal action follows a similar case in France, highlighting the Macrons' determination to combat widespread online misinformation and defend personal honor against baseless allegations.</p>

          <p>Fraud investigators are warning of a surge in Blue Badge fraud, with more fake, doctored, and stolen permits being sold online than ever before. The Blue Badge scheme provides essential parking access for disabled people, offering free parking and London Congestion Charge exemptions, making them highly desirable to fraudsters. However, the system is being "thoroughly abused" by individuals using badges belonging to family members, including deceased relatives, or entirely counterfeit ones. This widespread misuse not only takes up limited disabled bays, causing significant inconvenience for genuine users, but also makes legitimate badge holders targets for theft. Investigators are calling for increased enforcement and prosecutions to combat this growing problem.</p>

          <p>Edward Enninful, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, warns that the fashion industry risks reverting on diversity due to rising "anti-woke" rhetoric. He suggests that being "super-thin and European" is again becoming the beauty norm, despite years of progress towards more inclusive modeling and representation. Enninful, who championed diversity during his tenure, expressed excitement about returning to the industry with his new "inclusive" media platform, EE72, which focuses on women over 50. His comments highlight a significant cultural shift and the ongoing challenges in maintaining and advancing representation within fashion, emphasizing the need for the industry to redefine its values.</p>

          <p>China's jobless rate for individuals aged 16 to 24, excluding students, rose to 18.9% in August, marking a two-year high and indicating a deepening job crunch. This increase from 17.8% in July highlights significant challenges for young graduates entering the workforce, as job offers are rescinded and suitable positions are scarce. The article shares the experience of Maggie Li, a hotel management graduate who has struggled to find suitable employment despite numerous interviews, often finding roles different from those advertised. This data from the National Bureau of Statistics underscores a pressing economic and social issue for China's youth, with potential long-term implications for the country's economic stability and social cohesion.

          <p>Blake Snell delivered his best performance as a Dodger, pitching seven scoreless innings with a season-high 12 strikeouts in a 5-0 shutout victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Manager Dave Roberts initially approached the mound in the seventh after two walks, but trusted Snell to finish the inning, a decision Snell emphatically validated by striking out the final batter. This dominant outing provided a much-needed boost for the Dodgers, whose bullpen had been struggling, and helped them maintain a two-game lead in the National League West. Snell's performance, characterized by excellent fastball command and lethal breaking pitches, demonstrated his potential to be a key player for the team in their quest for a World Series title.</p>

          <p>A union representing CDC workers accuses the agency of jeopardizing accommodations for disabled employees by pausing remote work arrangements, following an updated Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) telework policy. This new policy does not explicitly include telework as a reasonable accommodation, causing significant confusion. Yolanda Jacobs, president of AFGE Local 2883, stated that disabled employees are awaiting clarity, with the CDC deferring to HHS guidance and pausing new requests for remote work accommodations until further notice. This situation has created significant concern among staff who rely on remote work due to their disabilities, with the union directing members to resources for potential legal action.</p>

          <p>A US immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered the deportation of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil to Algeria or Syria, citing his failure to disclose information on his green card application. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal, arguing the Trump administration is retaliating against him for exercising free speech, a claim Khalil echoed, calling it a "kangaroo immigration court." The judge found Khalil "wilfully misrepresented material fact(s)" to circumvent the immigration process, despite his denial of the claims. This ruling continues a legal battle for the former Columbia University student, who was previously detained for months amid a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus protests by the Trump administration.</p>

The agenda is pending, but German lawmaker Engin Eroglu will lead the European side, with plans for a biannual exchange, including a return visit to Beijing in May 2026.

          <p>The US is grappling with a dangerous spiral of hatred and violence following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with many doubting the country can lower its political temperature. The article highlights that political incentives reward outrage and extremism, exacerbated by social media, which Utah Governor Spencer Cox directly blames for recent political violence. While historical periods of US division exist, this era is distinct due to the amplification of anger by digital platforms and the economic models that profit from engagement. The deep polarization, with opposing narratives emerging after Kirk's death, makes reconciliation challenging, underscoring a critical threat to national unity and security.</p>
