        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has revealed that a power outage causing a complete shutdown of Heathrow Airport stemmed from an issue first identified seven years ago. The problem, moisture in an electrical substation, was detected in 2018, but necessary maintenance was never performed. The resulting fire and power failure affected over 66,000 customers and disrupted travel for approximately 270,000 passengers. This incident has prompted an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and raised serious concerns about the UK's energy infrastructure resilience and maintenance protocols.</p>

          <p>Alexi Saenz, the leader of a Long Island-based MS-13 clique, is set to be sentenced for his involvement in a federal racketeering case that includes eight murders and other violent crimes. Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, highlighting his continued gang activity while incarcerated and the "senseless" nature of the killings, which gained national attention. Saenz's defense is arguing for a 45-year sentence, citing his remorse, intellectual disabilities, and traumatic upbringing as mitigating factors. The case underscores the brutal violence of the gang and was previously highlighted by President Trump.</p>

While the university stated it was complying with NCAA rules at the time, it acknowledged that some athletes were disadvantaged by those policies.</p>

          <p>Canada's national soccer team's early exit from the Gold Cup tournament has left coach Jesse Marsch with significant challenges just a year before co-hosting the World Cup. The team's loss to Guatemala, a much lower-ranked opponent, has been attributed to a lack of composure, questionable tactical decisions, and an inability to perform under pressure. This disappointing result follows a similar failure in the Nations League finals, extending Canada's trophy drought since 2000. The premature exit also robs the team of valuable competitive matches needed for its World Cup preparations.</p>

          <p>An $88 million satellite named MethaneSAT, designed to track greenhouse gas emissions with high resolution, has been lost in space after it stopped responding to ground control. The project was backed by Jeff Bezos's Earth Fund, the New Zealand government, and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). Officials called the development disappointing but highlighted that space missions are inherently challenging. The EDF described the event as a setback rather than a failure, emphasizing the valuable knowledge gained.

          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has explicitly targeted what it calls "disorderly low-price competition" as a problem requiring government regulation. The term was used at a high-level economic meeting to describe the intense price wars affecting numerous Chinese industries. This direct language marks a shift from the more ambiguous term "involutionary competition" previously used by officials. Beijing views curbing these price wars as essential for fostering innovation, improving product quality, and ensuring the healthy development of its economy by phasing out outdated production capacity.</p>

The lawsuit alleged election interference due to editorial choices, a claim many legal experts viewed as weak. The settlement, which includes legal fees but no apology, was reportedly pushed by Paramount's corporate leadership against the wishes of CBS News executives. This deal is seen by some observers as an attempt by Paramount to secure regulatory approval from the Trump-led FCC for its pending sale to Skydance Media.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has stated that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire deal in Gaza. In a social media post, Trump urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which he said would be delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt, warning that conditions would only worsen otherwise. Israel has not publicly confirmed its agreement, and there has been no immediate response from Hamas. The announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict continue.</p>

The chaotic episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority just weeks after a commanding election victory.

The deal, which succumbs to US pressure, effectively weakens the "Pillar Two" agreement designed to ensure large companies pay at least a 15% tax rate on profits globally. Critics argue this move creates an uneven playing field, incentivizes a "race to the bottom" on tax policy, and undermines the multilateral process that included over 140 countries, prioritizing corporate interests over global equity.
