          <p>Model Emily Ratajkowski made her debut on the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show runway, wearing a pink lingerie set and orchid-shaped angel wings. Although this was her first runway walk for the brand, the 34-year-old previously featured in its 2023 Icon Campaign, expressing admiration for past legends like Gisele Bündchen and Naomi Campbell. Ratajkowski's career began at age 14 and gained significant momentum after her controversial appearance in Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" music video.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, announced that a complex repair plan has begun to restore the main power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The facility, which is Europe's largest nuclear station and currently under Russian control, has been relying on backup diesel generators for four weeks, posing significant safety risks. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have reportedly engaged constructively with the IAEA, establishing ceasefire zones to allow specialists to conduct the crucial repairs. Ukraine's energy minister noted this is the 42nd time power lines have needed restoration since the full-scale invasion began.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a competitive job market, applicants are increasingly using AI tools to create professional headshots, offering a fast and affordable alternative to traditional photography sessions that can cost hundreds of dollars. Services like HeadshotPro and Canva's new feature allow users to generate polished profile pictures for platforms like LinkedIn, with some users reporting a significant increase in recruiter outreach after updating their photos. However, the trend raises concerns about authenticity, as recruiters express wariness of overly stylized or fake-looking images. While the technology offers greater accessibility, it creates a new tension between maintaining a genuine personal brand and leveraging AI for a professional advantage.</p>

U.S. officials have acknowledged the difficulty in locating all the bodies amid the widespread destruction, stating that the U.S. is sharing intelligence with Hamas to aid in the recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Zions Bancorporation's stock value dropped by $1 billion after the company disclosed it was unlikely to be repaid on $60 million worth of loans, sparking a wider selloff in regional bank shares. The bank's subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, has filed a lawsuit alleging that borrowers from funds named "Cantor Group" engaged in a "sweeping betrayal of trust" by secretly subordinating the loans and eliminating the collateral. The issue was discovered after a related Cantor fund was sued for fraud by another bank, Western Alliance. Zions will charge off $50 million, impacting its third-quarter earnings.

The decision was made in discussion with King Charles III to prevent the accusations from distracting from the Royal Family's work.

While he will remain a prince by birthright, he gives up prestigious titles like Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, five years after stepping back from public duties.</p>

The event underscores the deep cultural and religious traditions of sumo, with organizers working to present an authentic experience for a largely Western audience.

While the 'X' marker remains legally valid on the passport itself due to a court order, the new data entry requirement creates ambiguity and potential for discrimination by individual agents. Legal experts are monitoring the practical implementation of the rule, which currently does not affect domestic flights or land crossings.</p>

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types, placing gold in the second category of items that produce nothing. He argues that unlike productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate value, gold's worth is entirely dependent on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future. Buffett famously illustrates this by stating that all the world's gold would fit into a cube about 68 feet on a side, an object one could admire but which would remain inert. He concludes that he prefers to invest in assets that deliver tangible output and value over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cities across the world, from New York to London and Ghent, are increasingly redesigning streets to prioritize cyclists, a movement aimed at creating cleaner, quieter, and more sustainable urban environments. By implementing protected bike lanes, redesigning intersections for better visibility, and adjusting traffic signals, cities are making cycling a safer and more appealing option for residents of all ages. This shift not only reduces carbon emissions and noise pollution but also offers significant health benefits and saves families thousands of dollars annually compared to car ownership. The growing popularity of e-bikes is further expanding the accessibility and reach of this transportation revolution.</p>

          <p>Marissa Coreno was 27 years old with no family history of cancer when she discovered a lump in her armpit, which she initially dismissed. After colleagues urged her to get it checked, she was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes. Her story highlights a rising trend of breast cancer diagnoses in women under 50, who often face more aggressive tumors and are too young for routine mammogram screenings. After undergoing chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation, Coreno is now cancer-free and hopes her experience encourages others to advocate for their health and investigate unusual symptoms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant political gender divide is emerging among Gen Z, with young women in the U.S. identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in modern history, while their male peers trend more conservative. This shift is attributed to young women feeling more directly impacted by political issues like reproductive rights, economic inequality, and social justice, leading them to view politics as a form of self-defense. Many reject the 'liberal' label, seeing both major parties as beholden to corporate interests and failing to address their material concerns. The polarizing effect of social media algorithms is also cited as a key factor in shaping these divergent worldviews.</p>

Troutman, currently the chief lobbyist for the American Cleaning Institute, has previously worked to weaken chemical disclosure laws.

          <p>An increasing number of American investors and celebrities are buying stakes in British soccer teams, with over half of the top 92 clubs in England and Wales now having some form of U.S. ownership. Investors are attracted by the global reach of leagues like the Premier League and the relatively affordable franchise prices compared to major U.S. sports leagues. This trend, highlighted by owners like Bill Foley at Bournemouth and celebrities like Ryan Reynolds at Wrexham, is bringing a more commercial approach to the clubs. The growing U.S. audience for British soccer, combined with popular media like "Ted Lasso," is further fueling this transatlantic investment wave.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced Friday that he has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, stating that Santos will be released immediately. In his announcement, Trump claimed Santos had been "horribly mistreated" while in custody. Santos had been serving a more than seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to federal charges of wire fraud and identity theft, surrendering himself to a New Jersey prison in July. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not erase the conviction, unlike a pardon, meaning Santos' criminal record will remain intact.</p>

          <p>As the U.S.-China trade war continues, China is demonstrating its economic leverage through strategic countermeasures and market diversification. Beijing has retaliated against U.S. tariffs by imposing its own and restricting exports of critical materials like rare-earth minerals, for which the U.S. is heavily dependent. Furthermore, China has successfully redirected its exports to other regions, with shipments to Africa and Southeast Asia growing significantly, reducing its reliance on the American market. While deep economic ties remain, China is also decreasing its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, signaling a gradual but deliberate financial disengagement.</p>

          <p>A significant buildup of U.S. military forces in the Caribbean, including thousands of troops and advanced hardware, has fueled speculation about a potential operation to remove Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power. The Trump administration has conducted at least five lethal strikes on boats alleged to be operated by Venezuelan drug cartels and has authorized covert CIA operations within the country. President Trump has framed the actions as a response to cartels and accused Maduro of weaponizing gangs and migration against the U.S. While the White House has not confirmed plans for direct intervention, the escalation marks a continuation of its "maximum pressure" campaign.</p>
