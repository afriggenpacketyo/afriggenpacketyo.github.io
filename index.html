          <p>President Donald Trump has commenced his second state visit to the United Kingdom, an honor not previously extended to a U.S. president. The visit includes significant royal pageantry, such as a carriage procession and a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III, aimed at reinforcing the U.S.-UK "special relationship." However, the event has been met with mixed reactions, including protests against Trump's policies and controversy surrounding the projection of an image of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein onto the castle. Security is extensive as the visit will also include policy discussions with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities are searching for a suspect, identified as Donald Henson, who allegedly rammed his car into an entrance gate at the FBI's Pittsburgh field office early Wednesday. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted attack" and an "act of terror against the FBI," noting that the suspect fled the scene on foot after the crash. No injuries were reported, but the suspect is considered potentially dangerous and may be experiencing a mental health issue. Authorities revealed that Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint that was determined to have no federal nexus.</p>

          <p>Climate change, urbanization, and global travel are contributing to a resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases across the United States, posing a significant public health threat. While once considered "tropical diseases," illnesses like Dengue, Chikungunya, and Malaria are re-emerging in the U.S., joining the already entrenched West Nile virus. A new threat, the Oropouche virus, is also being monitored as it spreads through South America and appears in U.S. travelers. Experts warn that the nation's public health infrastructure is fragile and may be unprepared to handle the accelerating risks from these vectors.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company after 47 years, stating that parent company Unilever has eroded the brand's independence and social mission. He expressed profound disappointment that the ice cream maker has been "silenced" and can no longer pursue its values, particularly referencing a 2022 dispute over sales in West Bank settlements. The resignation highlights the long-standing tension between the company's activist roots and the corporate objectives of Unilever. A spokesperson for Unilever's ice cream subsidiary disagreed with Greenfield's perspective, reaffirming their commitment to the brand's mission.</p>

          <p>Manchester United achieved a record financial revenue of £666.5 million for the last fiscal year, despite the men's team's worst league finish since the 1973-74 season. The record earnings were driven by strong commercial and matchday revenues, including a new front-of-shirt sponsorship deal with Snapdragon. Chief Executive Omar Berrada highlighted the club's financial resilience during a challenging period on the pitch.

          <p>A major Israeli ground offensive in Gaza City has prompted thousands of Palestinians to evacuate south, with many traveling on foot or in makeshift transport. The Israeli military announced it had struck over 150 targets and opened a second, temporary evacuation route to a designated "humanitarian area" that aid groups say is already severely overcrowded. The offensive has drawn widespread international criticism, including from the UN and Pope Leo XIV, amid reports of high casualties and attacks near hospitals. The operation is part of Israel's ongoing war against Hamas, which has resulted in a dire humanitarian crisis and a rising death toll in Gaza.</p>

The case involves unsolicited, flirtatious WhatsApp messages and explicit images sent to several men working in politics from accounts named "Charlie" or "Abi." Steadman is accused of making unwarranted demands for the phone numbers of up to 12 individuals. The scandal gained prominence after a Conservative MP admitted to sharing colleagues' numbers with a man he met on a dating app. Steadman was suspended from the Labour party following his arrest and has since resigned as a councillor.</p>

          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since last October has caused a massive spike in homeowner refinancing activity. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance a home loan jumped 58% last week and were 70% higher than the same period last year. The average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.39%, prompting many homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek savings. While purchase applications also rose slightly, the surge was overwhelmingly driven by refinances as consumers react to more favorable borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The article posits that while Swift and Kelce represent a conventional American fairytale, Electra and Rodman provided a bizarre and compelling narrative for misfits and outsiders. Their brief, tumultuous marriage challenged norms around race, gender, and celebrity, embodying a raw, anti-conformist spirit that stood in stark opposition to today's more polished celebrity pairings. The piece reflects on how their relationship offered a different kind of wish fulfillment, one that celebrated eccentricity over perfection.</p>

The article details how Trump's focus on personal relationships and perceived slights has alienated key allies like India, undermining a cornerstone of U.S. strategy to counter Beijing's influence in the Indo-Pacific.

This asymmetry, the article argues, forces a difficult choice: either maintain the high road while ceding influence or temporarily abandon it to reclaim power and push for a federal solution.

          <p>The union Unite claims that workers in the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) supply chain are being laid off with reduced or no pay and told to apply for universal credit following a major cyberattack. The hack has forced the carmaker to halt production, creating a shockwave through its extensive network of suppliers, many of whom are small and medium-sized firms dependent on JLR. Unite is calling on the UK government to establish a furlough scheme to protect the thousands of jobs at risk from the extended disruption. The production halt is estimated to be costing JLR at least £50 million per week.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is fueling a broad campaign on the American right to repress political opposition, which some analysts are calling a new "Red Scare." Prominent figures, including Vice President JD Vance and Stephen Miller, have vowed to use federal power to "dismantle and destroy" left-wing organizations they baselessly blame for the killing. This movement is leveraging social media to create blacklists and pressure employers to fire individuals for expressing opinions critical of Kirk. The article argues this represents a dangerous moment for free expression, combining the state's repressive power with modern "cancel culture" tactics.</p>

          <p>Executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a publicly traded company that owns dozens of strip clubs, have been charged with bribing a New York state tax auditor to evade over $8 million in sales taxes. The indictment alleges that over a decade, the company provided the auditor with perks including complimentary trips, meals, and up to $5,000 per day for private dances at its clubs. In exchange, the auditor allegedly assessed substantially lower tax liabilities during at least six audits. The New York Attorney General's office has charged the company, five of its executives, and three Manhattan clubs with conspiracy, bribery, and tax fraud.</p>

Speaking during a budget debate in the Bundestag, Merz identified three major threats: direct dangers to freedom from actors like Russia, economic pressure on Germany's free-trade model, and political forces seeking to divide society. He urged lawmakers to prepare for sweeping changes concerning how the country lives, works, and does business. His call for action comes as his conservative party is edged out by the far-right AfD in a new national poll.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have issued a health advisory about the New World Screwworm, a parasitic fly whose maggots infest the living flesh of warm-blooded animals, including humans. The fly has been spreading rapidly north from Panama, with hundreds of human infestations and several deaths reported in Mexico, and a case recently found in a traveler in Maryland. The fly's name, hominivorax, translates to "maneater," as its larvae burrow into and consume living tissue. While the risk to humans in the U.S. is currently low, the advisory warns of the potential economic devastation to the livestock industry if the pest becomes established.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom and national Democratic figures held a virtual rally framing the vote as essential for protecting democracy from President Trump. They argue it is a necessary response to gerrymandering in Republican-led states. Opponents, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, condemn the measure as a partisan power grab that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission and democratic principles, arguing that one cannot fight Trump by adopting his tactics.</p>

The initiative aims to combat the crisis of loneliness and disconnection that can make young men vulnerable to extremist ideologies. The article notes that Kirk's Turning Point USA organization was effective at providing a sense of belonging and purpose, something many young men lack. Newsom's program seeks to offer a similar sense of community and connection, but rooted in inclusive values and personal development rather than divisive politics.</p>

The incidents have roiled the Orange County city, which has a history of white supremacist activity and has more recently become a hub for the MAGA movement.

          <p>A $2.7-billion plan to expand the Los Angeles Convention Center is now in jeopardy after a city council committee voted to recommend a much smaller package of repairs and upgrades instead. Citing significant risks to the city's finances and a tight construction timeline before the 2028 Olympics, the committee opted for a less expensive alternative. City analysts warned that the full expansion could force cuts to basic services like fire and police for years to come. While business and labor groups have strongly advocated for the expansion as a crucial economic catalyst for downtown, the committee's decision reflects growing fiscal caution at City Hall.</p>

          <p>A Pentagon proposal to restrict civilian air traffic over the Johnson Valley Off-Highway Vehicle Area in California is facing strong opposition from recreational users, pilots, and local officials. The U.S. Marine Corps wants the restricted airspace to expand training exercises from its nearby Twentynine Palms base, but critics fear it will limit public access and compromise safety. Opponents argue the restrictions could prevent medical evacuation helicopters from reaching injured off-roaders and threaten major events like the annual King of the Hammers race. Many also see the proposal as a step toward a complete military takeover of land previously designated by Congress for shared public use.</p>

The move comes after a summer of increased deportations and concerns that the vast amount of location data collected on drivers could be used for immigration enforcement.
