          <p>A Cessna 208B aircraft carrying skydivers went off the runway at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey. All fifteen people on board sustained injuries, ranging from minimal to more severe, and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, noting that the same aircraft was involved in a previous runway excursion in July 2023.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled against a Trump administration order that sought to deny asylum to individuals crossing the southern border. The court determined that the president does not have the authority under federal law or the Constitution to implement such a sweeping ban. Immigrant rights groups, including the ACLU, had challenged the policy, arguing it was an unprecedented and unlawful prohibition on asylum. The ruling effectively halts the administration's attempt to supplant existing immigration statutes enacted by Congress.</p>

          <p>The Senate's latest major bill includes a provision for a 1% tax on international cash transfers, a move experts believe is aimed at discouraging illegal immigration. This "remittance tax" would apply to money sent by immigrant workers to their home countries, a practice that constitutes tens of billions of dollars annually. Proponents argue that taxing remittances makes it harder for undocumented immigrants to send money home, thereby reducing a key incentive. However, critics warn it could destabilize the economies of Central American countries and potentially spur more migration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following recent U.S. and Israeli military strikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran has passed a law halting cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. This move prevents independent verification of its program's status, raising concerns among nuclear proliferation experts that Tehran might pursue a more secretive and aggressive path to developing nuclear weapons. Some analysts fear this could lead Iran to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, similar to North Korea. The international community is left with little insight into Iran's rebuilding efforts, creating a precarious moment for regional stability.</p>

          <p>The Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73 individuals, is facing a severe threat due to the decline of their primary food source, the Chinook salmon. Conservation groups highlight that the salmon's own population is crashing due to habitat destruction. Their concerns are amplified by a proposed Trump administration change to the Endangered Species Act, which would narrow the definition of "harm" to exclude habitat damage. Experts warn this change could undermine critical conservation efforts and jeopardize the survival of the orcas.</p>

Prosecutors successfully argued she orchestrated the murder with her lover, Robert Baker, to collect on a life insurance policy. The case against her was built on extensive circumstantial evidence, including an affair with Baker, sharing home security credentials with him, and her suspicious behavior on the day of the murder. Despite Baker later testifying that Monica was not involved, the jury sided with the prosecution, and she has been sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson has stated that recent U.S. military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities have likely set back its program by approximately one to two years. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's claims of complete obliteration but suggests significant damage was inflicted, particularly to centrifuges at the Fordo enrichment site. The analysis comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the IAEA, making external verification of the damage difficult. The true extent of the setback remains a critical factor in determining the timeline for Iran's potential nuclear weapons capability.</p>

          <p>An aesthetic beautician in County Durham, England, has been identified as the source of illegal anti-wrinkle injections that left multiple women seriously ill, with one requiring resuscitation. The practitioner, Gemma Gray, used an unlicensed South Korean product called Toxpia, which led to at least 28 diagnosed cases of botulism, a life-threatening condition. Victims reported severe symptoms, including vision problems and difficulty breathing, after paying a discounted price for what they believed was Botox.
