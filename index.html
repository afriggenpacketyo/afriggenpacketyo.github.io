          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes adding up to two years of imprisonment for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings, aiming to prevent offenders from avoiding justice and providing a moment of reckoning for victims' families. The families of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, whose killers did not attend sentencing, advocated for this change. While powers exist to compel court attendance, they are infrequently used due to risks associated with restraining disruptive defendants, but additional restrictions like limited family visits and parole ineligibility are being considered.</p>

These efforts are designed to offer companies alternatives to potential delisting from U.S. exchanges and to reassure foreign investors, with plans to add yuan-denominated stock counters to the southbound Stock Connect mechanism and support cross-border investment products in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek’s mausoleum in Taoyuan as a “camp area,” reflecting the island’s authorities' efforts to erase the legacy of the former Kuomintang (KMT) leader. The mausoleum of Chiang’s son and successor, Chiang Ching-kuo, was also reclassified. The sites will no longer be referred to as “mausoleums” or “spirit-worship facilities.” The military said the revised guidelines reflected updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff argues that President Trump’s plan to weaken the dollar, as proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis. While the dollar's reserve-currency status plays a role in trade deficits, it is just one of many factors. Miran's plan overlooks crucial details such as the fact that foreign countries can accumulate Treasury bills without running trade surpluses. Rogoff suggests that closing the fiscal deficit is a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war, and that the strength of the American economy is a key factor behind the current account deficit.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden has criticized the Trump administration's pressure on Ukraine to cede territory to Russia as "modern-day appeasement," expressing concern over the potential breakdown of US-Europe relations. Biden emphasized that Putin believes Ukraine is part of Russia and that giving up territory would not satisfy him. He defended his own record on Ukraine, stating that he provided them with everything needed for their independence and was prepared to respond more aggressively if Putin moved again. He also condemned Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama Canal, acquire Greenland, and make Canada the 51st state.</p>
