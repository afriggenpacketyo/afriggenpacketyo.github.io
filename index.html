          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced strong criticism from House Democrats during a hearing on the DHS budget for 2026, particularly regarding immigration policies. Democrats accused Noem of breaking the law, hurting people, and making America less safe, citing incidents like the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka during a congressional visit to a detention center. Noem defended the administration's focus on border control, highlighting deportations of known terrorists. The hearing included contentious exchanges over access to legal counsel for detainees and the authenticity of a photo allegedly showing MS-13 tattoos. The overall tone was highly partisan, with Democrats expressing deep dissatisfaction with Noem's leadership.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt balances declining but interest rates remaining high, this article emphasizes the importance of strategic debt consolidation. Borrowers are advised to take the initiative rather than waiting for interest rates to drop, and to shop around for lenders to find the most cost-effective debt consolidation loan. The article suggests exploring both personal loans and debt relief companies, and considering alternatives like home equity lines of credit (HELOC) or home equity loans. By making these moves, borrowers can potentially reduce interest costs and simplify their debt management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Justice Secretary announced that over a thousand inmates in England and Wales will be released early to alleviate severe prison overcrowding. This measure, involving offenders serving one to four years who breached their licenses, aims to free up approximately 1,400 spaces. Shabana Mahmood stated that a £4.7bn investment would fund new prisons, but construction alone cannot resolve the crisis. A senior Ministry of Justice official warned that without action, the government would run out of prison spaces by November, so this action is being taken to avoid that outcome.</p>

She testified about "freak offs," drug-fueled events where she was allegedly forced to perform sexual acts with hired sex workers, feeling disgusted and humiliated by these experiences.

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber has chosen to cut his own pay by 25 percent, starting in July, as the university faces over $2.6 billion in federal funding cuts and clashes with the Trump administration over academic independence. This symbolic gesture accompanies other cost-saving measures, including a hiring freeze and suspended merit raises. The decision follows Harvard's expanded lawsuit against the administration, contesting accusations of insufficient action against antisemitism. Ninety tenured professors have also pledged to take a 10 percent pay cut to protect staff and students affected by the funding reductions.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Republican-backed Medicaid work requirements are a thinly veiled attempt to cut health care coverage for low-income individuals. The author explains that the policy is designed to fail, creating complex reporting demands that lead eligible recipients to lose their health care rather than encouraging employment. Evidence from state-level experiments shows that work requirements do not increase employment but instead create administrative burdens that deny coverage to eligible Americans. The author contends that the true aim is to finance regressive tax cuts by taking away health insurance from those who need it most.</p>

          <p>A study by Australian podiatrists found that Barbie doll's foot posture has evolved over time, correlating with her career or hobby. Researchers examined 2,750 dolls produced between 1959 and 2024, noting a shift from exclusively arched feet to a mix of arched and flat feet, with "employed" dolls more likely to have flat feet. Mattel confirmed that this design decision was intentional, reflecting expanded leisure choices and reimagined footwear options for Barbie.

          <p>The Israeli military conducted a strike in Khan Younis, Gaza, targeting Muhammad Sinwar, a top Hamas leader, but there was no immediate confirmation of his death. Israel has been systematically assassinating top Hamas officials throughout the war. Muhammad Sinwar is the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, a key figure in the October 7 attacks. He is known for his hard-line stance against compromises with Israel and is linked to the abduction of Gilad Shalit.</p>
