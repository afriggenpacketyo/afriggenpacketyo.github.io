          <p>Amazon successfully launched its first batch of Kuiper internet satellites into space aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, marking the beginning of its effort to rival Elon Musk's Starlink system. The mission aims to deploy a constellation of internet-beaming satellites in low Earth orbit, with plans to launch over 80 missions to meet the FCC's deadline of having half its constellation operational by July 2026. Amazon is investing up to $10 billion in the Kuiper network, anticipating commercial service for consumers, enterprises, and government entities later this year. Amazon expects Kuiper to become a meaningful operating income and return on invested capital business.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged with murder after allegedly driving into a crowd at a Filipino heritage festival in Vancouver, resulting in 11 deaths and numerous injuries. Witnesses described a scene of chaos and devastation, with the suspect apprehended by bystanders before police arrived. Authorities have ruled out terrorism as a motive, citing the suspect's history of mental health issues, and are investigating the incident. Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed condolences, and the tragedy has drawn comparisons to a similar attack in Toronto in 2018, prompting increased security measures for upcoming events like the Vancouver Marathon.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the prestigious legal journal was selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. This action follows the administration's earlier decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard due to concerns about antisemitism on campus and other issues, which prompted a lawsuit from the university. The investigations, conducted by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services, are in response to information suggesting discriminatory practices in journal membership and article selection, potentially violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its conflict with Democratic-led states and cities over immigration enforcement by announcing executive orders aimed at penalizing "sanctuary cities." The orders direct federal agencies to publish a list of jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration laws and empower law enforcement to pursue criminal aliens. This move follows a recent court ruling in California that barred the administration from withholding federal funds from sanctuary cities, highlighting the legal challenges and political resistance to Trump's immigration policies. The administration's focus on immigration is a key aspect of Trump's platform, as he approaches his 100th day in office.</p>

Using a radar with a long wavelength, the 1.2-tonne satellite will analyze slices through the trees to build a picture of the woody material present, helping scientists model climate change and track deforestation rates more accurately.</p>

          <p>Amnesty International's annual report asserts that the first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency have "supercharged" a global rollback of human rights, pushing the world towards an authoritarian era. The report cites growing inaction on climate change, violent crackdowns on dissent, and a backlash against the rights of migrants, refugees, women, and LGBTQ+ people as consequences of the "Trump effect." Amnesty warns that the situation will worsen as Trump continues to dismantle the rules-based world order, noting mass arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and lethal force as increasingly widespread tools of repression.</p>

          <p>Mexico and the United States have reached an agreement regarding the sharing of water from the Rio Grande basin, with Mexico committing to immediately increase water transfers to Texas farmers. The agreement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs and sanctions earlier in the month. The countries affirmed the 1944 treaty regulating water sharing and both countries agreed that it was still beneficial for both countries and not in need of renegotiation.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has experienced a mass exodus of attorneys following the confirmation of Harmeet Dhillon, who has outlined a shift in priorities under President Trump. Dhillon indicated the division would move away from traditional focuses like voting rights and policing reform to concentrate on culture war issues, prompting over 100 attorneys to resign. Democrats have raised concerns about the "politicization" of the division, while Dhillon has stated her intention to staff up the division to pursue the administration's priorities.</p>

          <p>60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley suggested that Paramount, CBS News' owner, has been increasing scrutiny of its content, particularly stories about the Trump administration, potentially compromising the program's editorial independence. This increased supervision is allegedly linked to Paramount's desire to gain FCC approval for its proposed merger with Skydance Media. The implication is that the Trump administration could influence the FCC to block the merger as a consequence of unfavorable coverage, raising concerns about freedom of the press.</p>
