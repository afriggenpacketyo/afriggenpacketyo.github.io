          <p>Police in Kathmandu, Nepal, opened fire on protesters demonstrating against a government-imposed social media ban and widespread corruption, resulting in at least 14 deaths and dozens of injuries. Tens of thousands, including students, marched towards Parliament, clashing with authorities who initially used tear gas before resorting to live fire. The unrest was triggered by the blocking of 26 unregistered platforms like Facebook and X, which officials defended as necessary for accountability, but which critics denounced as censorship. This event underscores deep public frustration over internet restrictions and broader governance issues in the fragile democracy, with hospitals reporting chaotic scenes and a volatile situation persisting despite curfews.</p>

          <p>Financial giant BlackRock's bid to acquire Minnesota Power, a Duluth-based electric utility, is drawing significant opposition from environmental and consumer advocates. Critics warn the $6.2 billion deal could lead to increased utility rates for over 150,000 customers, despite BlackRock's subsidiary, Global Infrastructure Partners, agreeing to a one-year rate freeze and non-binding green energy investments. An administrative law judge has already recommended rejecting the proposal, citing concerns that private equity firms prioritize profits over public interest and may not adequately fund the state's decarbonization goals by 2040. This article highlights the broader trend of Wall Street firms eyeing utilities due to rising energy demand from AI data centers, raising fears of "floodgates" opening for similar acquisitions.

The article highlights the cancellation's timing, following Colbert's public criticism of CBS for a settlement with Donald Trump, which Trump celebrated. While CBS attributed the decision to financial headwinds in late-night television, many industry observers interpret the Emmy win as a reaction to the public consternation surrounding the show's unexpected termination.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey strongly advised a Boston couple, Nick and his wife, to sell $250,000 worth of stocks and apply the proceeds directly to their mortgage, leaving a $30,000 emergency fund. Ramsey called their current approach "insanity," emphasizing the importance of rapidly eliminating debt. The article explores various strategies for faster mortgage payoff, such as lump-sum payments, increased regular contributions, or biweekly payments, while also cautioning about prepayment penalties. Ultimately, it stresses that the best financial move depends on individual circumstances, recommending consultation with a financial advisor for personalized guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump family, once "real estate guys," has undergone a significant "orange-pilling" conversion, embracing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency after facing ostracization from traditional finance post-presidency. Donald Trump, who previously called Bitcoin a "scam," now champions himself as the most crypto-friendly president, with his family reportedly making billions from various crypto projects. This article details how financial institutions cut ties with the Trumps, leading them to see conventional markets as a "Ponzi scheme" and find alignment with the crypto world, particularly during the Biden administration's crackdown. Concerns about conflicts of interest have arisen due to the family's extensive crypto holdings and the administration's pro-crypto policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The current job market is described as a "late-capitalist nightmare" for job seekers, with millions struggling to find employment despite strong corporate profits and a 4.3% jobless rate. This article highlights the frustration of applicants like a recent UC Davis graduate who received 200 rejections, often without response, after applying for hundreds of jobs. The proliferation of AI in hiring platforms, used for everything from resume screening to chatbot interviews, has created a "Tinderized" experience where applicants use AI to craft resumes, further fueling a cycle of impersonal rejections. The piece notes a low-hire, low-fire equilibrium, with Black workers and young people particularly affected, and warns of a likely recession.</p>

Wilson's views, including Christian nationalism, opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion, and downplaying slavery's horrors, are finding a receptive audience as evangelicalism aligns with the Republican agenda.

These laws weaken unions by allowing workers to opt out of paying dues for services received. The report showcases Illinois's success in adding 27,000 union members after guaranteeing collective bargaining rights, leading to better outcomes in homeownership, health insurance, and reduced reliance on government assistance for union members.</p>
