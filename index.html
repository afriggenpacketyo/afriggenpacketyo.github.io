          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 05:34:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced that all suppliers must offer a tariff with a lower standing charge by the end of January, though it is unlikely to reduce overall bills. This change addresses complaints from low-energy users who are disproportionately affected by fixed daily fees. However, consumer advocates and charities have criticized the move as insufficient, as the lower standing charge will be offset by higher per-unit energy costs, doing little to alleviate the burden of high energy prices. The new policy aims to provide more choice but does not fundamentally alter the total cost for most consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 05:31:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of Super Typhoon Ragasa, scientists are highlighting the connection between climate change and the increasing frequency and strength of major storms. Experts explain that warmer ocean temperatures, which have risen by approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius in the Pacific over the last century, provide more energy for typhoons. This additional energy allows storms to intensify more rapidly, transforming from a tropical storm to a super typhoon in a shorter period. Furthermore, these more powerful storms are more likely to stall over coastal areas, leading to prolonged periods of torrential rainfall and greater destruction.</p>

The company noted that comparable sales were down in all regions, with the largest decline seen in North America. In response to the challenging economic environment and rising operating costs, JD Sports is focusing on cost-saving measures and optimizing its store locations.

          <p>Following a meeting at the UN General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised President Donald Trump for being "well informed" after Trump signaled a major shift in his stance on the war with Russia. Trump stated on social media that he believes Ukraine is now in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to concede territory. Zelenskyy described the pivot as a "big shift," suggesting that Trump now has a better understanding of the battlefield situation and US intelligence aligns with Ukraine's.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has caused significant destruction in Hong Kong and southern China with hurricane-force winds and a massive storm surge, after already causing 14 deaths in Taiwan. In Taiwan, heavy rains led to a dam breach that unleashed a deadly wall of water. The storm, one of the most powerful globally this year, brought severe flooding to Hong Kong, trapping residents and causing extensive damage. In preparation for the typhoon's arrival, authorities in southern China evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from low-lying coastal areas.</p>

          <p>This opinion article scrutinizes Secretary of State Marco Rubio's recent praise for Mexico's cooperation in combating crime, questioning whether it reflects a true strategic partnership or a temporary appeasement. While acknowledging recent tactical measures by Mexico, such as increased extraditions, the author argues that the fundamental problem of collusion between the Mexican state and drug cartels remains unaddressed. The piece suggests that without tackling this deep-seated corruption, any current cooperation is likely superficial and that a more severe crisis is inevitable. The author calls for a visible signal from Mexico's president affirming sovereignty from cartel influence.</p>

They were not only used for flavor but also as markers of wealth, status, and even holiness in medieval Europe. The word "spicy" itself evolved around the 19th century from its literal meaning to also describe anything provocative, racy, or tantalizingly interesting.</p>

However, some local officials express concern that city-specific issues and candidates could be overshadowed by higher-profile national contests, and that longer ballots might overwhelm voters.</p>

          <p>Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old Mexican national and former DACA recipient, has died while in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Adelanto Processing Center. According to his family, Ayala-Uribe was in good health when detained but became visibly ill and was denied adequate medical care before suffering a fatal cardiac arrest. ICE stated that comprehensive medical care is provided to all detainees and that it has notified the relevant authorities. His death marks the 14th in ICE custody since January and has drawn renewed criticism of conditions at detention facilities.</p>

          <p>A total of 430 new laws are set to take effect in Maryland, introducing significant changes across various sectors. Among the most notable is a new sliding scale for speed camera fines, which will now range from $50 to $425 depending on how far over the speed limit a driver is traveling. Other key legislation includes the Expungement Reform Act, which expands eligibility for clearing criminal records, and Eric's ID Law, allowing a voluntary symbol on licenses to indicate an intellectual or developmental disability to emergency responders.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup approaches, Team Europe aims to win on American soil for the first time since their historic 2012 comeback at Medinah. Key to their strategy will be managing the notoriously raucous home crowd at Bethpage, a challenge captain Luke Donald is preparing his players for. Europe benefits from retaining Donald as captain and having a largely unchanged team from their 2023 victory, fostering continuity and experience. The performance of veteran leaders like Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm will be crucial in silencing the crowd and securing an early lead.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in public funds lost to fraud over the last year, aided by a new artificial intelligence tool. The technology cross-references data across government departments to identify and block fraudulent activity, including unlawful council tax claims and pandemic-related loan schemes. This represents the largest single-year recovery by government anti-fraud teams. The Cabinet Office has announced that the AI tool will now be licensed for use by international partners, including the United States and Australia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After President Trump highlighted a non-working escalator and teleprompter during his visit to the United Nations, a UN spokesperson clarified the cause of the incidents. The escalator reportedly stopped because a videographer from the U.S. delegation inadvertently triggered a safety mechanism at the top. Additionally, a UN official noted that the faulty teleprompter used during the president's speech was being operated by the White House, not UN staff. The incidents occurred amid ongoing budget cuts at the UN, which have occasionally led to the shutdown of building services.</p>
