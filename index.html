This move, part of an accelerated cost-saving program under new CEO Philipp Navratil, aims to save 3 billion Swiss francs by 2027. The announcement was met with positive market reaction, causing the company's shares to rise by nearly 8% as investors responded favorably to the decisive turnaround strategy.

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, surging 39.1% from the previous year and exceeding market expectations. This significant growth is primarily attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strengthening AI trend, TSMC raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure. The company's performance highlights its dominant position in the semiconductor industry amid the global AI boom.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would cease purchasing oil from Russia, a significant supplier to the nation since the Ukraine invasion. In response, India's Foreign Ministry did not confirm or deny the claim, stating its priority is safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring stable energy supplies. This development highlights the ongoing diplomatic pressure from the U.S. on India to reduce its economic ties with Russia. India has historically defended its decision to buy discounted Russian oil despite criticism from Western partners.</p>

          <p>The National Rifle Association, along with other gun rights organizations, has filed a lawsuit against the state of California over a new law banning the sale of Glock-style handguns that can be easily converted to fully automatic weapons. The lawsuit argues that the ban, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, infringes upon the Second Amendment by prohibiting the sale of firearms in common use. The challenged law, Assembly Bill 1127, is scheduled to take effect in July 2026 and aims to address the rising use of converted automatic weapons in crimes.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened with mixed results on Thursday, continuing a week of fluctuating trade as investors navigate economic uncertainties. Major indices like the U.K.'s FTSE and Germany's DAX saw slight declines, while the overall pan-European Stoxx 600 remained relatively flat. This follows a volatile week where markets hit a two-week low before rebounding, driven by gains in luxury brands and political developments in France. Investors are now awaiting key U.K. GDP data and corporate earnings reports for further direction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a modest 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.1% contraction in July. The slight expansion was primarily driven by a 0.7% increase in the manufacturing sector, while the dominant services sector showed no growth. Despite this return to growth, economists predict the economic outlook will remain sluggish due to rising costs for households and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming Budget. The figures place pressure on the government to stimulate a more robust recovery.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, with a recent focus on the country's gas production and distribution networks as winter approaches. Officials report that these strikes, particularly in regions like Kharkiv and Poltava, have damaged a significant portion of Ukraine's gas facilities, aiming to disrupt the heating season for civilians. This shift in targeting from the electricity grid to gas supplies forces Ukraine to seek additional gas imports and emergency equipment. The situation raises concerns about Ukraine's ability to provide heat to its citizens during the cold months.</p>

However, later statements from 2025 also emphasized the government's commitment to a positive economic relationship with Beijing.

The think tank argues that the government's current tight fiscal position is partly self-inflicted due to operating with minimal headroom.

          <p>A new study has found that Australia's tropical rainforests have become a net source of carbon emissions, a first for any rainforest globally. Traditionally considered "carbon sinks," these forests are now releasing more carbon than they absorb due to an increase in tree deaths caused by climate change-related factors like extreme temperatures and drought. The research, published in Nature, suggests that climate models may be overestimating the capacity of tropical forests to offset fossil fuel emissions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has started proceedings to potentially revoke the authorization of HKT, one of Hong Kong's largest telecom companies, to operate within U.S. networks. Citing national security risks, the FCC is concerned about HKT's ties to China, particularly through its part-owner China Unicom, which was similarly barred in 2022. The move is part of a broader effort by the FCC to remove Chinese state-linked entities from American communication systems to safeguard network integrity. HKT has been asked to show cause why it should be allowed to continue its U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man, Ian Currie, has been rescued after being lost for eight days in a remote and treacherous part of the Scottish Highlands. The experienced hillwalker encountered perilous conditions, including bad weather and difficult terrain, during a planned 30-mile trek from Glenfinnan to Knoydart. After his tent and phone became soaked, he was unable to call for help and endured days of cold and exhaustion before being found by a local landowner. Currie described the ordeal as a "nightmare" but expressed immense gratitude for his survival and rescue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of energy-intensive data centers to power Europe's artificial intelligence ambitions is creating a conflict with the continent's growing water scarcity issues, particularly in southern regions. These facilities require vast amounts of water for cooling, placing significant strain on local resources in areas already experiencing water stress, such as Spain and Greece. Critics argue that policymakers are prioritizing the AI boom without adequately considering the environmental impact on water supplies. While some tech companies are exploring water-efficient technologies, the scale of the planned expansion poses a significant challenge.</p>

The stronger fixing reflects a strategic decision by Chinese monetary authorities to manage the currency's value in the context of global economic trends and ongoing U.S.-China trade relations.

With over 60% of the capital's health facilities now non-functional, this closure further devastates access to medical care for the population.

          <p>A new report indicates that current commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement could prevent 57 additional deadly hot days per year compared to a scenario with no climate action. However, the world is still on track for at least 2.6°C of warming, which will significantly increase extreme heat events. The study, by World Weather Attribution and Climate Central, emphasizes that while the agreement has curbed the worst-case scenarios, current efforts are insufficient to meet the 1.5°C target. Experts warn that every fraction of a degree of warming increases risks to human health and ecosystems, urging for more ambitious emissions cuts.</p>

The flooding was caused by record-high water levels from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which washed away homes and critical infrastructure. The disaster has displaced around 1,500 people in a sparsely populated region, prompting a large-scale emergency response to move evacuees to shelters in hubs like Anchorage.
