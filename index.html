        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing reported a smaller net loss of $31 million in the first quarter of 2025, an improvement from the previous year, with revenue increasing by 18% to $19.5 billion, slightly surpassing analysts' expectations. The company's cash burn also improved, and CEO Kelly Ortberg highlighted progress in safety and manufacturing processes, particularly for the 737 Max. Boeing is seeking FAA approval to increase 737 Max production to 42 jets per month, and the company recently secured a major contract to build the U.S. Air Force's new fighter jet, the F-47. The company is selling parts of its digital aviation businesses, including its Jeppesen navigation unit, to Thoma Bravo for $10.55 billion in an all-cash deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government pledges to reduce driving test wait times, aiming to clear the backlog by summer 2026 by providing at least 10,000 extra tests per month. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged current wait times are unacceptable and outlined plans to double training capacity for examiners and reintroduce overtime pay incentives. A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, and the government will consult on changes to the booking system. The DVSA had originally aimed to cut waiting times to seven weeks by the end of this year, but has blamed an increase in demand and a change in customers' booking behavior for the backlog.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is asking the food industry to voluntarily stop using synthetic food dyes, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goal of replacing them with natural alternatives. This move stops short of an outright ban but aims to establish a national standard for the industry to make the switch by the end of 2026. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary claims the food industry is eager to remove artificial dyes, citing concerns about their impact on children's behavior and potential links to health conditions like ADHD. The FDA will also expedite the review and approval of new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. will withdraw from ceasefire efforts if Russia and Ukraine do not reach a deal, marking the second warning from the Trump administration in a week. Vance suggested both sides must concede territory to halt the conflict, as envoys from the U.S., Ukraine, and European nations convene in the U.K. for talks. While President Trump had proposed an unconditional ceasefire, which Kyiv accepted in principle but Putin rejected, the White House has welcomed a separate agreement to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, though the Kremlin considers that moratorium expired.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are suing the Trump administration, alleging that their free-speech rights were violated by the administration's freezing or cancellation of funding agreements for climate and environmental initiatives. The lawsuit claims that the administration targeted groups based on language in their grant documents, such as the use of the words "equity" and "socioeconomic," and attempted to force them to use different language. The administration's actions have jeopardized projects ranging from removing lead paint to cleaning up contaminated land, and are viewed as an effort to purge environmental justice programs and defund initiatives that conflict with the administration's views.</p>

          <p>The European Union has fined Apple and Meta a combined €700 million for violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA), marking the first penalties under the new legislation aimed at curbing the power of big tech.

The EU alleges that Apple restricts developers from informing customers of alternative offers outside the App Store, and that Meta's "consent or pay" model for cookies does not allow users to freely consent to data usage.

The EU's action underscores its commitment to enforcing digital competition laws and addressing concerns about the dominance of major tech companies.

          <p>Charlotte Beradt's book, *The Third Reich of Dreams*, reissued in a new translation, explores the dreams of people living under Nazi Germany, revealing the psychological impact of authoritarianism. Beradt recorded these dreams, or "nightaries," as reflections of the changes happening in waking life, interpreting them as attempts by the subconscious to make sense of a reality full of propaganda and fear. The dreams reveal a desire to conform to the regime, exposing the burden of freedom and the relief of unfreedom, highlighting how authoritarianism can hijack people's brains. The book taps into the primordial function that night visions played in human society long before Freud showed up.</p>

          <p>Two new documentaries promote regenerative agriculture as a solution to climate change, biodiversity loss, and other environmental problems. Regenerative agriculture focuses on improving soil health by reducing or eliminating synthetic chemicals, eliminating tillage, planting cover crops, and rotational grazing. While these practices have ecological benefits, the claim that regenerative agriculture can solve the climate crisis is overly simplistic and scientifically dubious. A shift to regenerative agriculture would increase demand for land, and the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is to reduce meat and dairy production.</p>

          <p>Nolann le Garrec, a France scrum-half, has apologized for diving during a Racing 92 match. Le Garrec suggested that the situation in the match contributed to his reaction, as Racing had just had a player sent off and trailed by 11 points with 10 minutes remaining. Rugby's laws expressly forbid players to "do anything that may lead the match officials to consider that an opponent has committed an infringement" or, more generally, to act contrary to "the spirit of good sportsmanship".</p>

          <p>The anti-abortion movement has increasingly embraced fetal personhood, leading to more punitive legislation that treats fetuses as people and risks charging women who have abortions with homicide. Mary Ziegler argues that the movement has always been a fetal-personhood movement, emboldened to disregard public opinion and democratic norms. This shift has resulted in prosecutions of pregnant women for conduct relating to their pregnancies, with the movement co-opting civil rights rhetoric to elevate fetuses as victims of discrimination. The movement is now focused on convincing courts that the 14th amendment already recognizes embryos and fetuses as people from conception.</p>

Apple disagreed with the findings but said it would follow the group's recommendations.

Americans estimate they need $1.26 million for a comfortable retirement, but the median amount saved is only $87,000.
