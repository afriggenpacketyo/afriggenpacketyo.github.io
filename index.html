          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 12:43:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service is anticipated to announce inflation-based adjustments to federal income tax brackets for 2026, a move that could provide financial relief to millions of American households. Projections suggest an inflation rate of around 2.7% will be applied, raising the income thresholds for each tax bracket to prevent "bracket creep," where cost-of-living pay increases push workers into higher tax rates without an actual increase in purchasing power. These annual adjustments, typically announced in the fall, will also affect the standard deduction, helping taxpayers retain more of their earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's unique and controversial "not proven" verdict is set to be abolished after the Scottish Parliament approved a comprehensive justice reform bill. This change, a major milestone in the country's legal history, will leave juries with only two possible verdicts: guilty or not guilty. Critics have long argued that the "not proven" verdict, which has the same legal effect as a not guilty verdict, is confusing and fails to provide closure for victims. The reforms also include raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict to two-thirds and establishing a specialized court for sexual offenses.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. While currently posing no immediate threat to land, forecasters anticipate it will strengthen, potentially reaching hurricane status over the weekend as it moves north of the Caribbean. The storm's projected path keeps it over open water for several days, though it could approach Bermuda by next week. Its formation comes after the historical peak of the hurricane season, which has so far been quieter than initially predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators converged in central London to protest U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, a consortium of over 50 unions and charities, the march proceeded towards Whitehall with participants carrying signs denouncing racism and the president's policies. Protesters expressed a wide range of grievances, from climate change denial to his political stances, with many stating he was not welcome in the country. The Metropolitan Police deployed over 1,600 officers to manage the rally, which occurred amidst the formal pomp and pageantry of the official visit.</p>

          <p>A state-mandated report has revealed that the Los Angeles Police Department fired more than 1,000 projectiles, including bean bags and rubber rounds, at demonstrators on a single day in June. The protest, which involved approximately 6,000 people, was a response to the Trump administration's immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard. The significant use of force has drawn concern from legal experts, who question whether the actions violated a 2021 California law restricting the use of less-lethal munitions on crowds.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point interest rate cut this week, though the decision is shadowed by significant political pressure from the White House. President Trump has publicly urged the central bank to implement a larger reduction, and his new appointee, Stephen Miran, is expected to dissent in favor of a more aggressive cut. While the initial rate decrease is largely anticipated by markets, the Fed's forecast for the remainder of 2025, detailed in its "dot plot," will be closely watched for signals of future policy. The meeting highlights growing tensions between the Fed's mandate and political influences. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police is implementing what it calls an "Al Capone approach" to accelerate the removal of officers who fail to meet professional standards. This strategy involves using evidence of lesser infractions, such as issues with sickness records or overtime claims, to dismiss problematic officers quickly, rather than waiting for lengthy investigations into more serious criminal misconduct to conclude. The force has already removed over 1,400 officers since 2022 in its largest-ever clear-out, which was initiated following the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer. Officials state that serious criminal investigations will continue even after an officer is dismissed.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has firmly rejected the idea of deploying the National Guard to Chicago to address crime, creating a clear contrast with states like Tennessee that have welcomed such federal intervention. President Trump recently announced his intention to send troops to Memphis and expressed a desire to do the same in Chicago, though the legality of deploying troops without a governor's request is unclear. In an interview, Pritzker, who has been mentioned as a potential future presidential candidate, emphasized his executive experience and his support for Vice President Kamala Harris in the current political landscape.</p>

          <p>The practice of prisoner swaps between the United States and Russia has evolved into a complex and accepted element of foreign policy, marking a significant shift from the post-Cold War era. This article details how both the Biden and Trump administrations have engaged in high-stakes trades to free unjustly detained Americans, such as journalist Evan Gershkovich and WNBA star Brittney Griner. These deals, while successful in bringing citizens home, have also raised concerns that they may embolden Russia to take more Westerners as bargaining chips. The process now involves intricate, multi-country negotiations, highlighting a new, more transactional era of diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Over 100 liberal philanthropic organizations, including the Ford Foundation and Open Society Foundations, have co-signed a letter denouncing political violence in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. The statement condemns such acts while also preemptively defending their charitable work against anticipated criticism from the Trump administration, which has signaled a potential crackdown on left-leaning groups. The letter rejects attempts to exploit the tragedy to mischaracterize their missions or restrict freedoms of speech and giving. This unified front comes after administration officials linked Kirk's death to "leftwing extremism" and criticized the tax status of these foundations.</p>

Steven Lyons, Ross McGill, Stephen Jamieson, and Steven Larwood were taken into custody in the United Arab Emirates, where they are based. Police Scotland believes the men are connected to a range of criminal activities, including drug importation and a violent gang feud in Glasgow and Edinburgh that has led to shootings and firebombings. The arrests are considered a major development in Operation Portaledge, an initiative created to combat the ongoing gang violence.</p>

          <p>A recent U.N. Commission of Inquiry report cited the destruction of Gaza's Al-Basma IVF centre as an act intended to prevent Palestinian births, one of five acts it classifies as genocide. For Najwa Abu Hamada, who lost her stored embryos in the Israeli attack, the finding brings no justice, only painful memories of her lost hope for another child. The Israeli strike destroyed an estimated 4,000 embryos and 1,000 other specimens. Israel has strongly denied the genocide allegations, stating its military operations follow international law and are aimed at eradicating Hamas, not deliberately targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once designated two different properties as his "principal residence" on mortgage documents signed on the same day in 2007. This revelation is significant because President Trump cited a similar situation as the basis for his attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he accused of mortgage fraud. Bessent himself had previously commented that if a Fed official committed mortgage fraud, they should not be serving as a regulator. While the situations are not identical, the report highlights a potential parallel that complicates the administration's stance on the issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has accused Democrats of risking a government shutdown by demanding an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits as part of a short-term funding bill. Johnson argued that the subsidies, set to expire at the end of the year, are a separate policy debate that should be addressed in December, not tied to the September 30 government funding deadline. House Republicans released a stopgap bill that funds the government through November 21 but omits the ACA extension. Johnson warned that if Democrats hold their ground on this issue, they will be solely blamed for any resulting shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

These modern cowgirls are reshaping the industry's culture by emphasizing community, mental health, and economic empowerment over the rugged individualism of the past. The article profiles several women who navigate the immense physical and financial challenges of ranching—from freak accidents and medical debt to land scarcity—while building supportive networks and businesses. Their stories highlight a significant demographic shift, with women now accounting for over 36% of all agricultural producers in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed its most significant response to the war in Gaza, including plans to restrict trade with Israel and impose sanctions on extremist government ministers. The measures would suspend parts of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, removing privileged market access for Israeli goods and imposing tariffs. However, the proposal faces significant hurdles, as trade restrictions require a qualified majority of member states' approval and sanctions require unanimity, both of which are currently lacking due to divisions within the EU. Israel has condemned the proposal as "morally and politically distorted" and vowed to retaliate in kind.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama has warned that the United States is facing a "political crisis of the sort that we haven't seen before" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While noting his disagreement with Kirk's views, Obama called the killing a tragedy and criticized the rhetoric of President Trump and his allies, contrasting it with the unifying approaches of past presidents during moments of national tension. In response, the White House accused Obama of being the "architect of modern political division." The exchange underscores the deep political polarization in the country following the politically motivated killing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island, alleging that a student loan forgiveness program for teachers in the Providence Public School District is racially discriminatory. The initiative offers up to $25,000 in debt relief to new teachers who identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian, but excludes white teachers. The DOJ's complaint argues this violates federal law and seeks an injunction to stop the program's use of race as an eligibility criterion.

          <p>A U.S. defense official has revealed that the Israeli airstrike that killed six people in Doha, Qatar, was conducted using ballistic missiles launched from fighter jets over the Red Sea. This novel attack method was likely designed to evade Qatar's air defenses and avoid violating the airspace of neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia. The missiles, traveling at hypersonic speeds through the upper atmosphere, would have been extremely difficult for Patriot missile defense systems to intercept. The September 9 attack targeted Hamas leaders and upended ceasefire negotiations, leading to Israel's subsequent ground offensive in Gaza City and heightening regional tensions.</p>
