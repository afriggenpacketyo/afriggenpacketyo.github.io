          <p>Home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest rates have been steadily decreasing, reaching their lowest point since 2023, averaging 7.95%. The article explores the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on HELOC rates. While a rate cut is not expected this week, comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell regarding future rate cuts could influence HELOC rates. The article suggests that borrowers monitor the rate climate, as HELOC rates adjust monthly, offering potential cost savings even without immediate Fed action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House amidst ongoing trade disputes and past threats of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. Trump asserted the U.S. doesn't need anything from Canada, while Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, vowed to fight for the best possible deal for Canada. The meeting occurred following Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods and Canada's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products. The historically friendly relationship between the two countries is currently strained, and the discussions aimed to address trade pressures and the broader economic and security relationship.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate panel is reviewing cases involving two international students, Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts University and Mohsen Mahdawi from Columbia University, who face removal from the U.S. after expressing views critical of Israel. The Trump administration revoked Ozturk's student visa, leading to her arrest and detention, while Mahdawi was detained during his citizenship interview. The court is weighing whether to pause lower court orders that favored the students while challenges to their detentions proceed.

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop despite exceeding revenue expectations and raising its revenue guidance for the year.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, with a 39% revenue increase from the previous year. CEO Alex Karp expressed optimism, stating Palantir is "on fire" due to a combination of 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are considering curtailing or ending Medicaid provider taxes, a move that could save the federal government $600 billion over the next decade but significantly impact states, especially those led by Republicans. These taxes, used by states to increase federal matching funds, involve taxing hospitals and nursing homes and returning dollars to them as higher Medicaid payments. Critics call the practice a “gimmick” that allows states to create federal money out of thin air, while proponents warn that eliminating the taxes would leave states with substantial budget holes.</p>

          <p>States have long used taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to increase federal Medicaid matching funds, a practice now under scrutiny by congressional Republicans. This tactic, known as a Medicaid provider tax, allows states to inflate Medicaid spending on paper and collect more federal matching funds. If Republicans curtail or end these taxes, it could save the federal government approximately $600 billion over the next decade, but could hit Republican-led states particularly hard due to their reliance on this strategy.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport has experienced significant delays and cancellations due to equipment malfunctions and air traffic control staffing shortages. System outages, particularly at the Philadelphia TRACON, have reduced the ability to manage air traffic. The FAA has implemented ground delays and stops, with arriving flights delayed up to six hours. The FAA has also partially blamed runway construction, but the construction project has been long running and airlines have factored that in.</p>

Styled by Law Roach, André 3000 emphasized the illusion of the piano's heft with a workwear-inspired jumpsuit from his fashion brand, Benji Bixby, and Burberry.</p>

          <p>Port Sudan, which had been a relatively safe haven during Sudan's civil war, has come under attack by a series of drone strikes.

The attacks follow previous strikes on a military warehouse and an oil depot. The city had become a temporary capital and a place where many sought to rebuild their lives, but the recent attacks have disrupted the sense of security.</p>
