          <p>A recent report reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo apartments resold in the last year were sold at a loss, a stark contrast to the national housing market. The median price per square foot has remained stagnant for a decade, with factors like tax deduction caps and pandemic-related migration contributing to the weakness. While the ultra-luxury market of properties over $10 million has seen profits, the broader market's performance is significantly trailing inflation, surprising many who view real estate as a hedge.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's sudden demolition of the historic 123-year-old East Wing of the White House to build a $300 million ballroom is an exercise of unchecked power. The author criticizes the project for proceeding without public input or submitted plans and for being funded by major corporations, which raises ethical concerns. The piece suggests the move is driven by ego and speculates it could be a sign of Trump's intention to challenge presidential term limits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent social media rumors about active serial killers in cities like Austin, authorities and criminologists confirm there is no evidence of such activity, pointing instead to other causes for the deaths. The article explores the paradox of America's growing cultural obsession with serial killers, fueled by true-crime documentaries and series, even as their actual numbers have plummeted by over 80% since the 1970s. This decline is attributed to factors like advanced DNA technology, fewer hitchhikers, and increased public awareness of stranger danger.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly canceled a planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco after receiving a personal phone call from the city's mayor and lobbying from influential tech billionaires, including the CEOs of Nvidia and Salesforce. The article criticizes this method of governance, pointing out that a significant domestic security decision was reversed not based on policy or data, but on the capricious influence of the president's wealthy friends. The reversal has temporarily eased tensions, but highlights the instability of the administration's decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has been the target of numerous racist and Islamophobic attacks throughout his campaign. Opponents, including former Governor Andrew Cuomo and current Mayor Eric Adams, have employed bigoted rhetoric, referring to him as a "terrorist sympathizer" and "the communist." The campaign has also seen the circulation of AI-generated ads with racist caricatures, contributing to what observers call an unprecedented level of personal vitriol in a New York electoral race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a new law that reclassifies non-native mute swans as an invasive species, permitting them to be hunted year-round starting January 1. Wildlife officials support the measure, arguing that the large, aggressive birds damage fragile wetland ecosystems and displace native waterfowl, of which California has lost over 90% of its historic habitat. However, the law has been condemned as "inhumane" by some animal advocacy groups who see it as a move to appease the hunting industry.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its fourth week, federal employees are facing escalating financial hardship and anxiety, with many now missing their first full paycheck. The political impasse between Republicans and Democrats over the federal budget shows no sign of resolution, forcing workers to consider liquidating assets or taking on second jobs to survive. The shutdown has also caused chaos at agencies like the EPA, where mass furloughs are impacting environmental protection efforts.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has euthanized four gray wolves from the Beyem Seyo pack due to what officials called an "unprecedented" surge in cattle kills in the Sierra Valley. Despite extensive non-lethal hazing efforts, the pack had become dangerously reliant on livestock for food, a behavior that risked being passed to younger generations. The decision reflects the ongoing challenge of balancing the conservation of the protected species with the economic concerns of local ranchers.</p>

          <p>A new federal law enacting nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade is causing significant anxiety in the rural South, particularly in states like Louisiana that expanded the program. The legislation will impose new work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which researchers estimate could lead to hundreds of thousands of low-income residents losing their health coverage. In impoverished communities with limited job opportunities, the impending cuts are viewed as a devastating blow to a crucial lifeline.</p>

          <p>In a move seen as a sign of hope for traditionalist Catholics, the new Pope Leo XIV has approved the celebration of the old Latin Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. The Mass was led by Cardinal Raymond Burke, a prominent American conservative, for a group of pilgrims. This development is being interpreted by supporters as a potential shift toward a more conciliatory approach to the traditional liturgy, following the significant restrictions that were imposed by his predecessor, Pope Francis, in 2021.</p>
