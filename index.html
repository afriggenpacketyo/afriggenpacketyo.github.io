          <p>United Launch Alliance has postponed the second launch of Amazon's Project Kuiper internet satellites due to adverse weather conditions at Cape Canaveral. Originally scheduled for Friday, the launch is now set for June 16, aiming to deploy another 27 satellites into low Earth orbit, increasing the constellation to 54. Amazon is accelerating satellite deployments to begin customer service later this year, competing with SpaceX's Starlink, with plans to launch over 3,000 satellites and meet the FCC deadline of launching half by July 2026. The first successful launch occurred in April, dispatching 27 satellites. Optimism regarding the project's progress remains moderate due to external factors such as weather conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed to have spoken with California Governor Gavin Newsom about the riots in Los Angeles, stating he urged Newsom to "get his ass in gear" and stop the unrest.

The White House Director of Communications criticized Newsom for siding with rioters instead of protecting Californians, while Newsom's spokesperson confirmed no missed calls or voicemails on the governor's phone.

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy U.S. Marines and National Guard troops to Los Angeles is projected to cost taxpayers at least $134 million, according to the U.S. defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. The deployment includes 700 Marines and 2,000 National Guard troops. Hegseth defended the mobilization as necessary to assist with deportations and control rioters. Democrats have criticized the move as federal overreach and questioned its legality and cost. This is a contentious political and fiscal issue and has a low optimism score.</p>
