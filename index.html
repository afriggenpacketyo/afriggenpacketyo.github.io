          <p>Intel's stock surged over 7% following reports that the Trump administration is in discussions to take a government stake in the company. This move aims to bolster domestic manufacturing of high-tech computer chips, a key priority for the administration, and would help fund Intel's new factories in Ohio. The potential investment highlights a broader trend of increased government involvement in key industries to advance national and economic security interests. Intel has declined to comment on the speculation but affirmed its commitment to working with the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a special election to redraw the state's congressional maps in a direct response to Republican efforts in Texas to gerrymander districts. This political maneuver is designed to offset potential GOP gains in Texas, which could be crucial in determining control of Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. While Texas Republicans aim to make five Democratic-held seats more favorable to the GOP, California Democrats believe they can create five new Democratic-leaning districts. The process in California is more complex, requiring a constitutional amendment approved by voters.</p>

          <p>In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated that a Mississippi law restricting minors' social media access would likely violate the First Amendment, yet he voted to allow it to remain in effect for now. He argued the tech trade group suing had not proven it would suffer irreparable harm, invoking a legal standard the court has seemingly ignored in cases involving the Trump administration. The article suggests Kavanaugh's opinion signals that the core of the First Amendment remains safe from further erosion and that the court applies different rules for most litigants compared to President Trump.</p>

          <p>China has preemptively purchased large quantities of soybeans from Brazil for September and October, a period traditionally dominated by U.S. exporters. This strategic shift, securing about half of China's projected demand from South American sources, effectively sidelines American farmers during their most profitable sales window. The move reflects Beijing's increasing trade reliance on South America amidst ongoing political and commercial friction with Washington. This action is expected to keep downward pressure on soybean futures prices, which are already near five-year lows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith has issued a new order expanding cooperation with federal immigration authorities, a significant policy shift for the "sanctuary city." The order allows local officers to share information about individuals not in custody and transport federal agents, though it maintains prohibitions on checking immigration status without cause. This change follows President Trump's recent decision to place the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control for 30 days, deploying nearly 1,500 federal officers and National Guard members into the city to address a declared public safety emergency.</p>

          <p>During a campaign tour in the Bronx, New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani highlighted the borough's population decline as evidence of a city-wide affordability crisis.

          <p>David Zervos, a Wall Street strategist and a potential candidate to lead the Federal Reserve, has strongly advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. He argues that current monetary policy is too restrictive and that a half-percentage-point cut is needed to prevent a labor market slowdown and potentially create a million new jobs. Zervos, one of nearly a dozen names being considered to succeed Jerome Powell, believes his market-focused background would be a benefit to the central bank's decision-making process.

The E1 project, long frozen due to international opposition, would sever the West Bank from occupied East Jerusalem, a critical blow to the viability of a future Palestinian state. The move has drawn sharp condemnation from the UN, EU, and UK, who view the settlements as illegal under international law and a major obstacle to peace.

The article suggests that future rate drops could be tied to upcoming economic data releases, such as the September employment and inflation reports.

          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, are donating $2 billion to the Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute, marking the largest single donation ever to a U.S. health or academic institution. The gift is intended to revolutionize the scientific approach to cancer research, treatment, and patient care. This monumental pledge builds on a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising for the institute, led by cancer research pioneer Dr. Brian Druker. The donation underscores the Knights' extensive philanthropic history and their commitment to advancing medical science.</p>

          <p>German soccer club Bayern Munich has ended its "Visit Rwanda" sleeve sponsorship, a deal that drew heavy criticism from fans and human rights activists due to Rwanda's human rights record and alleged role in the DR Congo conflict. Instead of severing ties completely, the club announced a "strategic evolution" of the partnership, now focusing on youth football development through its academy in Kigali. Experts suggest the move was forced by external pressure rather than moral concerns, as Bayern signed a new deal with Emirates Airlines just days earlier, another partner with a controversial human rights background.</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, reaching a market valuation past $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its massive valuation, which dwarfs that of more profitable tech giants, Palantir only recently posted its first quarter with over $1 billion in revenue. This has resulted in a sky-high forward price-to-earnings ratio, indicating that investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its future AI-driven growth.

          <p>The annual Monterey Car Week auctions are underway with modest sales expectations, reflecting a significant generational shift in the classic car market. Sales are projected to decline for the third consecutive year, with the high-end market for cars from the 1950s and 1960s showing the most weakness. As Baby Boomer collectors age out, younger millennial and Gen Z buyers are showing preference for more modern, practical, and affordable supercars from the 1980s onward. This rotation in taste is leading to an oversupply of older classics and changing the dynamics of one of the world's most prestigious collector events.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a Glasgow school pupil, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for inventing a device to help homeless people stay warm. At age 12, she designed a solar-powered blanket that stores the sun's heat during the day in a battery pack to provide warmth at night. Her idea won a national engineering competition, and the engineering firm Thales subsequently produced working prototypes that are now being used by a homeless charity in Glasgow. As part of the honor, which is in partnership with Lego, Young was also immortalized as a Lego mini-figure.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author Rebecca Solnit argues that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C. is a hypocritical power grab based on false pretenses about crime. She contrasts the move with the violence of January 6, 2021, which Trump instigated, noting that violent crime in the city is actually at a 30-year low. Solnit frames the intervention as part of a broader right-wing war on cities, which are seen as threatening bastions of diversity, tolerance, and progressive values. She concludes that the takeover is a manufactured drama intended to distract from other issues and assert authoritarian control.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has taken federal control of Washington D.C.'s police and deployed the National Guard, legal experts suggest such a move would be far more difficult to replicate in other U.S. cities. Unlike D.C., which falls under direct federal jurisdiction, the 50 states have governors who command their own National Guard units. The Posse Comitatus Act also broadly prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. While Trump could attempt limited interventions to protect federal property, a full takeover of a city's police force outside the capital would face significant legal and constitutional challenges.</p>
