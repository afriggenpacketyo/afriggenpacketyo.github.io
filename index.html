          <p>Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces an additional indictment for abuse of authority, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. This new charge comes as Yoon is already on trial for leading an insurrection related to his brief declaration of martial law in early December, for which he could face life in prison. The Constitutional Court had previously stripped Yoon of his power and privileges after a parliamentary motion to impeach him was upheld in April. The announcement of the additional charge follows a raid on Yoon's residence as part of a probe into bribery allegations involving his wife.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on the global economy. The central bank now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5% and core consumer prices to rise by 2.2% in fiscal 2025. Despite these revisions, the BOJ has maintained its benchmark interest rate and remains committed to raising rates further if economic conditions align with its expectations. The BOJ also released its forecasts for fiscal year 2027 for the first time, projecting 1.0% growth and 1.9% core CPI.</p>

          <p>French utility group Suez, backed by BlackRock, is reportedly reviewing its water-infrastructure assets in China, potentially valued at over $1 billion. The company has enlisted HSBC Holdings to explore options for the business, including approaching potential buyers, as part of a broader effort to streamline global operations. While considerations are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, Suez could seek non-binding bids from Chinese firms and infrastructure funds.

          <p>In her first major address since leaving office, Kamala Harris delivered a forceful critique of Donald Trump's first 100 days in power, accusing him of sowing fear and chaos to consolidate executive power. Speaking to Democrats in San Francisco, Harris warned of a "wholesale abandonment of America's highest ideals" and praised those resisting Trump's agenda. She urged Americans to organize, run for office, and stand up for fundamental rights, framing the current moment as a "high-velocity event" implementing a decades-in-the-making conservative agenda. Harris also referenced a viral video of elephants protecting their vulnerable during an earthquake as a metaphor for collective resistance.</p>

The article draws a parallel to the American withdrawal from Vietnam 50 years ago, suggesting that President Trump's policies, including trade tariffs and cuts to foreign aid, represent another form of withdrawal. While American ideals and images still resonate, China's economic and military presence is increasingly felt across the region. The article highlights concerns about China's intentions and a desire for the U.S. to remain engaged, particularly in countries like Myanmar and Cambodia.</p>

          <p>Several European auto giants, including Stellantis, Mercedes, and Volvo Cars, have either suspended or cut their full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainties stemming from President Trump's trade tariffs. These corporate updates followed Trump's imposition of a 25% tariff on automotive imports into the U.S., leading to a sharp drop in first-quarter profits for many automakers. While some companies applauded Trump's move to ease car tariffs, analysts warn that the volatile nature of these policies will likely hinder long-term corporate investment decisions. Volkswagen, however, maintained its guidance but expects results to be at the lower end of forecasts.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths. This deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the U.S. to continue investing in Ukraine's defense and reconstruction, according to President Trump. The agreement establishes a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, which the Trump administration says will help repay an estimated $175 billion in aid provided to Ukraine since the war began. While Ukrainian officials have portrayed the deal as equitable, critics have raised concerns about the terms and potential exploitation of Ukraine's resources.</p>

          <p>The US and Kyiv have signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, solidifying investment in Kyiv’s defense against Russia. The minerals deal, which has been the subject of tense negotiations for months and nearly fell through hours before it was signed, will establish a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that the Trump administration has said will begin to repay an estimated $175bn in aid provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war. Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, confirmed in a social media post that she had signed the agreement on Wednesday. “Together with the United States, we are creating the fund that will attract global investment into our country,” she wrote.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, citing concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. Despite inflation remaining above the BOJ's 2% target, the central bank acknowledged the potential for a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The BOJ highlighted its commitment to raising rates if economic and price forecasts are realized.

          <p>A California Assembly committee has revised a controversial bill that aimed to end solar credits for 2 million rooftop solar system owners, limiting its impact to those who sell their homes. The original bill would have reduced the credit period from 20 years to 10, but this provision was removed. While the bill passed the committee with the amendment, rooftop solar owners and other stakeholders expressed concerns that it would still reduce the value of their homes. The bill is intended to address concerns that the financial credits given to rooftop solar owners for excess electricity are raising electric bills for those without solar panels.</p>
