          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 16:05:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's market value plummeted by over $68 billion after CEO Elon Musk revealed plans to establish a new political party called the "America Party." This announcement has stoked significant anxiety among investors, who worry that Musk's political ambitions are a detrimental distraction for the company. Analysts note that this venture into politics comes at a crucial time, as Tesla is already grappling with a 14% year-on-year decline in car deliveries and escalating competition. The move has drawn criticism from President Donald Trump and revived concerns about the impact of Musk's political activities on the electric vehicle maker's brand and stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI-focused cloud provider CoreWeave has agreed to acquire data center infrastructure company Core Scientific in a $9 billion all-stock transaction. The deal is designed to expand CoreWeave's access to power and real estate, giving it ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of capacity across Core Scientific's U.S. data centers. CoreWeave executives state the acquisition will eliminate $10 billion in future lease obligations and enhance operational efficiency by reducing long-term rental costs. The transaction, expected to close in late 2025, will also give CoreWeave the option to convert Core Scientific's cryptocurrency mining operations to handle AI workloads, capitalizing on a growing market.</p>

          <h2>Political Commentary Highlights Heightened Racism in New York City Mayoral Campaign</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has been the target of extensive racist and Islamophobic attacks from both conservative and some Democratic figures. This article details how public figures have called for his deportation, made derogatory comments about his culture, and baselessly smeared him as antisemitic for his pro-Palestinian stance. The commentary argues this rhetoric is a product of a political era where hate speech has been normalized, particularly under the influence of Trumpism. It posits that the attacks reflect a broader, acceptable bigotry in American politics against Muslims, immigrants, and supporters of Palestinian rights.</p>

          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed the recovery of the remains of all seven workers who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse. The fatal incident occurred at the unpermitted Devastating Pyrotechnics facility, which is located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The blast also ignited multiple grass fires that burned approximately 80 acres. Federal and state agencies are investigating the scene, while the coroner's office is working to formally identify the victims through DNA testing, a process that has been painful for the victims' families awaiting answers.</p>

          <p>A new tax package signed by President Trump provides an additional deduction for seniors but does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security for most, contrary to some administration claims. Tax experts clarify that the new deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and over primarily benefits middle-income seniors and is unlikely to completely erase their tax liability on benefits. Furthermore, critics argue the legislation weakens Social Security's long-term financial stability by reducing its tax revenue, which could hasten the trust fund's projected insolvency date. The analysis highlights the difference between the law's political framing and its actual financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

While praising Musk's past efforts, DeSantis argued that such a move would likely split the Republican vote and lead to Democratic victories. Instead, DeSantis suggested Musk should use his influence to advocate for constitutional amendments, such as a balanced budget requirement and term limits for Congress. This commentary positions DeSantis within the ongoing feud between Musk and President Donald Trump, offering a different strategic approach to addressing what he terms problems within the Republican Party.</p>

Shortly after Starovoy's death, another senior transport official, Andrei Korneichuk, also died suddenly of a reported cardiac arrest during a meeting.

          <h2>Advocates Fear Proposed Changes to Student Loan Forgiveness Program Could Be Used for Political Retribution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 15:06:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is drafting an overhaul of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program that critics fear could be weaponized for political purposes. The proposed changes would strip eligibility from organizations involved in vaguely defined "illegal activities," with a focus on immigration services and support for transgender youth. Advocacy groups and financial aid experts invited to review the draft raised concerns that the policy would grant the Education Secretary subjective power to target entire hospital systems, universities, or local governments that run afoul of the administration's political agenda. This could block huge numbers of public service workers from receiving promised loan cancellation.</p>

          <p>A new round of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza, has ended in Doha without any significant progress. According to Palestinian sources, the Israeli delegation lacked the necessary authority to finalize an agreement. The negotiations, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, took place as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss the conflict. Meanwhile, the BRICS group of nations issued a statement expressing "grave concern" over the situation in Gaza and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages and detainees.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has sharply criticized the Department of Justice for its inconsistent positions in the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, a Maryland man who was illegally deported to El Salvador. U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chinis expressed "real concerns" after DOJ attorneys provided conflicting timelines about the investigation into Abrego, which he described as "like nailing jello to a wall." The judge is considering an order to force the administration to return Abrego to Maryland, countering the government's plan to immediately begin new deportation proceedings. The case has been marked by contradictory statements from the White House and DOJ, creating significant legal confusion.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a new species of pterosaur from a 209-million-year-old fossilized jawbone, making it the oldest known flying reptile ever discovered in North America. The fossil was unearthed in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park and analyzed by a Smithsonian-led team. The newly named species, Eotephradactylus mcintireae, was about the size of a small seagull and lived during the late Triassic period. This discovery helps fill a critical gap in the fossil record, providing new insights into the evolution of pterosaurs and the ecosystem they inhabited just before a major extinction event.</p>

          <p>California has made significant progress toward its goal of conserving 30% of its lands and coastal waters by 2030, but state officials warn that federal actions could reverse these gains. A new report shows the state has conserved 26.1% of its land, largely due to the recent designation of two new national monuments by the Biden administration. However, the Trump administration has signaled it may abolish these monuments and has terminated the national 'America the Beautiful' conservation initiative. This creates a potential conflict between state-led environmental efforts and a federal agenda that could roll back protections for public lands.</p>

The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, fired numerous rounds at the entrance of the federal facility located at the McAllen International Airport but did not gain entry. Border Patrol agents and local police returned fire, neutralizing the threat. Two officers and a Border Patrol employee sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the incident.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for more than 70,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, putting them at risk of deportation. The Department of Homeland Security stated that conditions in the two Central American countries have improved enough to end the humanitarian program, which was first granted in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch. Many of the affected individuals have lived and worked legally in the U.S. for decades. This move is part of the administration's broader effort to curtail humanitarian immigration programs and expand the population eligible for its promised mass deportation campaign.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas serves as a tragic reminder of the destructive power of floods, which have caused some of the deadliest disasters in U.S. history. This article provides historical context by examining past events, led by the 1889 Johnstown Flood in Pennsylvania, where a dam failure killed over 2,200 people. Other major events include Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which claimed 1,833 lives after New Orleans' levee system failed, and the Great Flood of 1913 in the Midwest, which resulted in at least 467 deaths. These historical disasters underscore the immense human cost and engineering challenges associated with flood events.</p>

          <p>Reported measles cases in the United States have reached a 33-year high, with nearly 1,300 confirmed infections this year, marking a concerning resurgence of the vaccine-preventable disease. The outbreak has affected 38 states, with Texas being the hardest-hit, and has resulted in at least three deaths and 155 hospitalizations. Health officials report that 92% of cases were in individuals who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. The surge is occurring primarily in communities with low vaccination rates and comes amid growing anti-vaccine sentiment, threatening the nation's measles elimination status, which was declared in 2000.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has conducted a significant wave of airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, including bombing a British-owned cargo ship that the group had seized. The vessel, Galaxy Leader, was hijacked in November 2023 and had reportedly been fitted with radar to serve as a floating observation post for the terror group. Israel stated the strikes, which also hit several ports, were a response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel and international shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthi forces retaliated by firing missiles at Israel, further escalating the regional conflict fueled by the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>An analysis of emergency alerts issued during the Texas flash floods reveals a series of escalating warnings from the National Weather Service (NWS) as the disaster unfolded. The timeline shows that the first alert for the affected area with urgent, life-threatening language was sent to cellphones at 4:03 a.m., as the Guadalupe River began to rise rapidly. Over the next several hours, the NWS sent multiple "Flash Flood Emergency" alerts with increasingly dire messages, including "SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!" However, no alerts were initiated by local county governments, raising questions about the overall effectiveness of the warning system in reaching residents in time.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, questions are being raised about the adequacy of emergency warnings and whether federal budget cuts affected forecasting. While local officials claim the rainfall exceeded forecasts, meteorologists defend the National Weather Service's performance, pointing to escalating alerts issued hours before the worst flooding. However, concerns persist about NWS staffing shortages and the suspension of programs that coordinate between meteorologists and local emergency managers. Critics argue that insufficient warnings and a lack of a robust local alert system contributed to the catastrophic loss of life, including at least 27 deaths at a summer camp.</p>
