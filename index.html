          <h2>Amherst College Grapples with Declining Black Student Enrollment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amherst College, known for its diversity, faces an identity crisis as Black enrollment plummeted to 3% in the freshman class of 2024, a stark contrast to the 11% overall Black student body in 2023. This decline has impacted the Black student community, leading to decreased engagement in meetings and events. The drop is particularly jarring given Amherst's historical commitment to diversity and its success in attracting Black students compared to similar institutions. The college is now grappling with the implications of this shift and seeking ways to address the concerns of its Black students, as the sense of community has noticeably changed. Optimism among students has decreased as a result of the decline. </p>

          <p>Karolina Zurawska, a 42-year-old woman with paranoid schizophrenia, received an indefinite hospital order after admitting to the manslaughter of her six-year-old son, Alexander Zurawski, and the attempted murder of her father.

Judge Paul Thomas KC emphasized the order was for medical help, not punishment, acknowledging Zurawska's deteriorated mental state impacted her understanding of her actions.

          <p>Ryan Hemphill, a private equity executive, faces a 116-count indictment for predatory sexual assault and other crimes, accused of turning his apartment into a torture chamber where he allegedly sexually assaulted six women.

Investigators found surveillance cameras, hundreds of bullets, drugs, and fake cash in his apartment. Hemphill, who met the women through websites, faces a potential life sentence if convicted, and authorities believe there may be more victims. (The article is not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is accelerating permit approvals for mining, drilling, and fossil fuel projects on public land, aiming to drastically reduce the review process to just 28 days. This move, justified as a response to a national energy emergency, has been criticized by environmental advocates who argue it will bypass crucial environmental reviews and public input. Experts anticipate legal challenges, citing potential adverse impacts on public lands, water sources, and endangered species. The American Petroleum Institute supports the expedited permitting, while former officials warn of potential slip-ups and reduced oversight due to workforce reductions.

          <p>President Trump is pushing for a resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, even at the cost of territorial concessions, as he nears his 100th day in office. Special envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow for talks with Putin, but recent Russian attacks on Kyiv have prompted rare criticism from Trump. The U.S. has presented a proposal involving recognition of Russia's control of Crimea, sanctions relief, and Ukraine's neutrality in exchange for security guarantees and territorial gains. Ukraine's leadership has consistently rejected territorial concessions, making a potential agreement challenging.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering amending the Crime and Policing Bill to impose life sentences on cyclists who cause death through dangerous cycling. The proposed change aims to align cycling offenses with driving offenses, allowing for harsher penalties for serious injuries or fatalities caused by reckless cyclists. The Department for Transport states that the updated legislation will ensure those who disregard the safety of others face the full force of the law. The government estimates that cyclists caused four of the 1,600 deaths on UK roads last year.</p>

Prosecutors argue that Mangione intentionally killed Thompson to amplify an ideological message and provoke resistance to the healthcare industry. They further claim that Mangione poses a future danger due to his expressed intent to target the industry and evade law enforcement. Mangione's attorneys have previously argued that the government is using the case as a political stunt, and he also faces state charges in New York and Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>Germany is contemplating phasing out 1 and 2-cent euro coins, following similar moves by other European nations. The National Cash Forum, backed by the Bundesbank, argues that these coins are largely unused and costly to maintain in circulation. The proposal involves implementing a rounding rule for cash payments, rounding the total bill to the nearest 5 cents. While electronic payments would still allow for exact pricing, this move aims to reduce production costs and environmental impact, though some fear it could lead to price increases.

The survey, covering 2,000 sites, found PFAS levels above the provisional cap in 242 locations, with the highest level detected in Osaka Prefecture. While the health impacts of PFAS are still under investigation, some researchers have warned of potential cancer risks. The contamination is often found near factories, U.S. military bases, and Japan Self-Defense Forces facilities, and authorities have taken measures to switch water sources or restrict consumption in affected areas.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly planning to move all iPhone assembly for the US market to India, aiming to reduce its reliance on China amid trade tensions. The shift, potentially occurring as soon as next year, would involve sourcing over 60 million iPhones annually from India. Apple's main Indian suppliers, Foxconn and Tata, have already been ramping up production and shipping handsets to the US. While analysts doubt iPhone production will return to the US due to cost factors, Apple's move signals a strategic diversification of its manufacturing base.</p>
