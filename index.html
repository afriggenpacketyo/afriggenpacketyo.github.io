        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether gold bars and coins are a smart investment this October, considering factors like price volatility and economic uncertainty. Gold prices have surged in 2025, driven by global uncertainty and strong central bank buying, making it a standout performer compared to traditional investments. While timing any investment is tricky, the article suggests that gold's record highs can signal continued momentum, with analysts projecting further upside potential. Inflation remains a concern, and gold has historically served as an inflation hedge, making it an attractive option for investors seeking stability and portfolio diversification, as it is not tied to corporate earnings or government debt. (not investment advice) The overall stability and potential for growth are reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded in a vehicle and stabbing attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, England, during Yom Kippur. Police shot and killed the suspect, and a bomb disposal unit was deployed as a precaution, as authorities are treating the incident as a terror attack. The Manchester Evening News reported that the suspect did not enter the synagogue and was shot by armed officers at the scene. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack, noting its occurrence on Yom Kippur, and announced increased police presence at synagogues nationwide, reflecting the severity of the event and its impact on the Jewish community. The emotional impact of the event is reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway has reached an agreement to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking Berkshire's largest deal since 2022. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt, which will enable the company to restart buying back stock, according to CEO Vicki Hollub. Greg Abel, Buffett's successor as CEO, highlighted Hollub's commitment to Occidental's long-term financial stability, with the deal expected to close in the fourth quarter. Buffett initially invested in Occidental in 2019 to support its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, and Occidental intends to start redeeming Berkshire's preferred stock in 2029, as it grows its cash position. The relative stability of this acquisition is reflected in the score.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the common misconception that lower-priced stocks inherently have more upside potential than higher-priced stocks. It dispels this "low-price bias," explaining that a stock's price alone is not an indicator of value or potential returns. The article uses the example of International Paper versus Nvidia to illustrate that focusing on fundamental growth outlook and qualitative dynamics is more important than nominal price. The piece emphasizes that valuation and underlying fundamentals should drive investment decisions, not the stock price, and that investors should be aware of their own biases to make informed choices. The overall stability and potential for growth are reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>This article examines the debate surrounding health care for immigrants in the U.S. illegally amid the government shutdown. Republican lawmakers claim Democrats want to provide free health care to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, a claim Democrats deny. The dispute centers on reversing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid eligibility restrictions for noncitizens, which Democrats seek to restore to pre-2025 rules, encompassing immigrants with legal status or government permission. While federal law prohibits taxpayer-funded medical coverage for undocumented individuals, some Republicans argue that restoring federal Medicaid funding would allow Democratic-led states to spend more on health care for immigrants residing in the country unlawfully. The controversy and political tension are reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches record highs, some experts suggest reconsidering the traditional "set-it-and-forget-it" investment strategy. Michael DeMassa argues that the S&P 500 is "broken" due to its market capitalization-weighted nature and heavy concentration in the technology sector. Instead, experts recommend diversifying investments by opting for a total market index fund or broadening exposure with funds that exclude S&P 500 stocks. Other strategies include equal-weighted S&P 500 index funds, with the goal of creating a more balanced portfolio that can withstand market pullbacks, particularly in areas like small cap, value, international, and bonds.

          <p>A coroner ruled that a high-profile conspiracy theorist influenced her daughter to reject chemotherapy, leading to her death from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Paloma Shemirani, 23, declined chemotherapy in favor of alternative treatments advocated by her mother, Kate Shemirani, who was previously struck off as a nurse for anti-vaccination views. The coroner stated that the influence contributed more than minimally to Paloma's death, as treatment would have given her an 80% chance of a cure.

While some argue she is not ready for a presidential campaign, others suggest a Senate run in New York could be more realistic, especially given potential vulnerabilities of incumbent Chuck Schumer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported a 7% increase in quarterly vehicle deliveries, totaling 497,099, before a key tax credit for electric vehicle buyers in the U.S. expired. Despite the increase in deliveries, Tesla's production declined compared to the previous year, with 447,450 vehicles produced. The company's third quarter was impacted by a sales slump in Europe, partially offset by increased sales in the U.S. due to buyers rushing to take advantage of the expiring tax credit. The stock price has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter, and the company deployed 12.5 GWh of its storage products, including Megapack and Megablock systems. The overall stability and potential for growth are reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has put hundreds of thousands of federal workers at risk of losing pay, with about 750,000 expected to be furloughed each day. Essential staff, including air traffic controllers and border patrol agents, are required to keep working without pay until funding resumes. The shutdown was triggered after the Senate failed to pass a short-term funding bill, and labor unions have sued over potential permanent job cuts. The shutdown's effects will be most visible in the government's largest agencies, with significant numbers of employees required to work without pay or placed on unpaid leave. The disruption and uncertainty are reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>A fight over health policy, specifically the cost of premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans, is driving the current federal government shutdown. Enhanced tax credits for these premiums are set to expire at the end of the year, and Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for a Republican funding bill that did not include an extension. Without the enhanced subsidies, premium payments by enrollees are expected to increase by 114%, potentially causing millions to lose coverage.

          <p>U.S. employers cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The rise in layoffs comes as the labor market has stalled in recent months, with employers also sharply scaling back their hiring plans. While the pace of layoffs is easing, some signs suggest a stagnating labor market, and the Federal Reserve is monitoring the situation for signs of weakness. A decline in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers could help bolster the job market, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring. The economic uncertainty and potential for improvement are reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>This article argues that focusing on the political beliefs of mass shooters undermines the fight against gun violence. Identifying shooters as Democrats or Republicans fails to capture the evolving profile of people who enact mass and targeted violence, as high-profile shootings are often committed by individuals influenced by online spaces. The article suggests that a fixation on violence and nihilistic, conspiratorial beliefs are more relevant than traditional politics. The author argues that research into how shooters radicalize is under threat, and that binaries such as Republican or Democrat are inadequate for understanding the drivers of high-profile crimes. The controversy and concern are reflected in the score.</p>

Cheng emphasized that Taiwan has never made any commitment on a '50-50' division, and will not agree to such terms in the future. Instead, Taiwan is seeking consensus with the US on supply-chain cooperation and preferential tariff treatment. Trade talks with US officials focused on the "Taiwan model," which supports the island's technology industry remaining rooted at home while expanding abroad.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla reported a surprise increase in sales in the third quarter, likely benefiting from a rush by consumers to take advantage of a $7,500 tax credit before it expired on September 30. Sales rose to 497,099, compared with 462,890 in the same period last year, defying analysts' expectations of a slight decline. The gain follows two quarters of steep declines, as people turned off by CEO Elon Musk's foray into right-wing politics avoided buying his company's cars and even protested at some dealerships. Despite the controversy surrounding Musk, the increase in sales is a positive sign for the company. The overall potential for growth is reflected in the score.</p>

          <p>A study has revealed that the ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules, offering further evidence that it could host extraterrestrial life. Data collected by the Cassini space probe showed that the ocean has many elements needed for life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide, and phosphorus. Scientists have identified numerous organic molecules, including precursors of amino acids, in samples from the moon's surface. This discovery proves that the complex organic molecules are readily available in Enceladus's ocean, enhancing the likelihood that the moon is habitable.
