          <p>The San Francisco 49ers defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26-23 in a tense overtime game, improving their season record to 4-1. The 49ers' defense made a crucial fourth-down stop in overtime to seal the win after kicker Eddy Pineiro successfully made a 41-yard field goal. Quarterback Mac Jones, filling in for an injured Brock Purdy, had a strong performance with 342 passing yards and two touchdowns.

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals that China has constructed additional replicas of key Taiwanese government buildings at its Zhurihe military training base in Inner Mongolia. According to a Japanese think tank, these new structures, which resemble Taiwan's foreign and defense ministries, suggest more systematic and combat-oriented training for a potential invasion. The training area has reportedly tripled in size since 2020, with images showing brigade-sized forces conducting drills simulating an attack on Taiwan's presidential palace. This development indicates an escalation in Beijing's military preparedness and focus on a potential conflict across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, manufactured by Evita Solutions. The decision, described by the FDA as a standard regulatory process, has drawn sharp criticism from anti-abortion groups and conservative politicians who view it as a setback. This approval comes as the Trump administration's top health officials are already reviewing the drug's safety under pressure from abortion opponents. Reproductive rights advocates defended the FDA's move, stating that career scientists were simply following established procedures for approving generic medications, which increases access and affordability.</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei has experienced a significant political defeat after the nation's Congress voted to override two of his vetoes. The laws in question will now increase funding for public universities and pediatric healthcare, measures Milei had blocked citing budget constraints. This marks the second time the opposition-controlled Senate has overturned his decisions, signaling a challenge to his authority and austerity-focused reform agenda. The setback comes as Milei's popularity wanes amid a corruption scandal and public fatigue with drastic welfare cuts, potentially impacting his party's standing ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Apps designed to track the locations of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have sparked a major controversy, with law enforcement agencies claiming they endanger officers. The debate escalated after an attacker who targeted an ICE facility was found to have used such an app, leading Apple to remove the popular 'ICEBlock' app from its store. Developers and civil liberties advocates argue the apps are a form of protected speech, similar to crowdsourcing police speed traps, and provide a safety tool for undocumented communities. Legal experts suggest a government ban would be difficult, as the apps are US-based and protected under the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>Robert Morris, the 64-year-old founder of the prominent Gateway Church in Texas, has pleaded guilty to the sexual abuse of a 12-year-old girl that occurred in the 1980s. As part of a plea agreement, Morris received a 10-year sentence but will serve only six months in jail, followed by probation, and must register as a sex offender. The victim, Cindy Clemishere, who is now 55, publicly accused Morris in 2024, stating the abuse lasted for four years while he lived with her family. In court, she confronted Morris, emphasizing that his actions had profoundly impacted her entire life.</p>

The discovery is historically significant because many of the coins, minted in Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru, still have visible dates and mint marks.

          <p>Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is set to be acquired for $55 billion by a consortium including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, a move analysts see as a win for investors. However, the deal raises concerns within the gaming community about the company's future direction, given its history of prioritizing monetization over innovation. While going private could allow for more creative risks, some experts predict EA will double down on its profitable but controversial live-service models and microtransactions to service the $20 billion in debt incurred by the deal. This could lead to further consolidation around major franchises rather than the development of new intellectual properties.</p>

          <p>A corgi shepherd mix named Opie, who disappeared from his Northern California home during a storm in July, has been found over 2,000 miles away in a Chicago suburb. The dog was turned in as a stray, and a scan of his microchip revealed his owner's contact information, leading to a joyful reunion. The owner, who immediately flew to Illinois to retrieve her pet, believes Opie may have been taken from a local gas station after he ran off. The incident highlights the critical importance of microchipping pets and keeping the registered contact information up to date.</p>

          <p>In an act of compassion, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has raised more than $300,000 for the family of the gunman who attacked a Michigan chapel, killing four people. David Butler, a Utah-based author, said he was motivated by his faith's teachings to 'love our enemies' and care for the widowed and orphaned after learning the suspect left behind a wife and children, including one with a chronic illness. Despite some backlash, the crowdfunding campaign far exceeded its initial $10,000 goal, with thousands of donors, many of them fellow church members, contributing to support the family.</p>

Scientists found that the warming planet made an event of Ragasa's intensity about 49% more likely compared to pre-industrial times. The study estimates that climate change increased the typhoon's wind speeds by 7% and rainfall by 12% at landfall, attributing roughly one-third of the total damage in southern China directly to its effects. The findings warn that as global temperatures continue to rise, tropical cyclones are expected to become increasingly powerful and cause greater devastation.</p>

The plan involves a direct-to-consumer platform where pharmaceutical companies, starting with Pfizer, will offer medications at significant discounts, aligning prices with those paid in Europe. For example, the arthritis drug Xeljanz could see its price drop from $6,000 to $3,600 per month.

TikTok stated it is committed to providing age-appropriate experiences and took immediate action after being notified of the issue.
