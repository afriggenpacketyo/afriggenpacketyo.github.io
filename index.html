          <p>A shooting at the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, resulted in three fatalities and three injuries. Authorities report that the suspect, identified as 26-year-old Dakota Hawver, opened fire on multiple people in the valet and parking lot areas before being engaged by a security guard and police. The suspect was shot and is hospitalized in critical condition. Officials have stated there is no known connection between the gunman and the victims, one of whom was identified as a local restaurant co-owner. The incident is being investigated as a senseless act of violence.</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old man in the UK, Tim Hull, has chosen to stop taking life-saving medication for his kidneys due to what he describes as exhaustive battles and failures within the National Health Service (NHS). For two years, he faced long waits for specialist appointments, incorrect equipment for his significant height, and a lack of coordinated care for his rare neurological condition, leaving him bed-bound. His decision highlights systemic issues within the NHS, as his family feels he was abandoned by the system. Only after opting for end-of-life care did he begin to receive more integrated support, a tragic irony his sister noted.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, to a lifetime appointment on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a narrow 50-49 vote. The confirmation was highly contentious, with Democrats protesting due to multiple whistleblower allegations of misconduct against Bove during his time at the Justice Department. These allegations include claims that he suggested ignoring court orders and engaged in politically motivated firings of staff. Despite the controversy and calls for a delayed vote, his nomination was advanced and ultimately approved along party lines.</p>

          <p>Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has decided to keep its monetary policy unchanged, citing significant economic uncertainty for the latter half of 2025. The MAS warned that growth is expected to moderate, particularly in trade-related sectors, due to concerns over global trade and potential U.S. tariffs. Despite strong GDP growth in the first half of the year, the export-dependent economy remains vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and changes in global tariff policies. Officials noted the U.S. was non-committal about tariff levels for Singapore, adding to the uncertain outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a nearly $6.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students who alleged the university permitted an antisemitic and hostile environment during pro-Palestinian protests. The lawsuit claimed protesters blocked Jewish students from accessing campus areas and made threats, with the university's acquiescence. As part of the settlement, UCLA admitted it had "fallen short" and will allocate funds to Jewish community groups and an anti-antisemitism initiative. The U.S. Department of Justice also found that UCLA had violated students' civil rights by failing to act.</p>

New York City Mayor Eric Adams described the event as an "intentional, sick, twisted act of violence."

Victims included a Blackstone employee, an off-duty NYPD officer, a security guard, and a building management employee.

After the first game, Dominguez simply walked from the home clubhouse at Camden Yards to the visiting one to join his new team. This meant he was available to pitch for the Orioles against the Blue Jays in Game 1 and then became eligible to pitch for the Blue Jays against his former Orioles teammates in Game 2. The trade sent prospect Juaron Watts-Brown to Baltimore and is Dominguez's second deadline-season trade in two years.</p>

After the culling, the animals' bodies were used for research samples and then fed to the zoo's predators. Animal rights activists protested the decision, with some being arrested, and have filed a criminal complaint, arguing the killing of healthy animals was illegal and avoidable with responsible breeding policies.</p>

This article argues that such incidents follow a predictable pattern where genuine concerns are stripped of context and amplified by algorithms and media outlets.

Kennedy Jr. may disband the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), two senators have introduced a resolution to support its continuation. The bipartisan resolution, sponsored by Sen. Angus King and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, recognizes the task force's crucial, evidence-based work in providing preventive care recommendations for conditions like cancer and heart disease. The move aims to put pressure on the administration to preserve the independent panel, which has been instrumental in shaping health insurance coverage for essential screenings since the Affordable Care Act.</p>

          <p>The gunman who killed four people in a Manhattan office building reportedly believed he was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease linked to head trauma. A note found on the shooter, Shane Tamura, requested his brain be studied for the disease and blamed the NFL for concealing the dangers of football, though he never played professionally. CTE can only be diagnosed posthumously but is associated with mood swings, dementia, and violent behavior. The case highlights the growing public awareness and concern surrounding CTE, particularly its connection to contact sports and tragic outcomes.</p>

The infection occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose, and it is almost always fatal. The family hopes to prevent similar tragedies by ensuring the public understands the dangers, stating, "we don't want his death to be in vain."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has initiated a process to draft a rule that would prohibit all law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from concealing their identities with masks or gaiters. The move is a direct response to recent immigration raids where armed federal agents, their faces hidden, have apprehended people in public. While the L.A. County Sheriff's Department already has policies requiring identification, the new rule aims to extend this to federal agents operating in unincorporated areas, though it is expected to face a legal challenge from the federal government on supremacy grounds.</p>

          <p>Following the EPA's proposal to repeal its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health, California may be positioned to lead a state-level resistance. The federal move threatens to dismantle national emissions standards, but experts suggest it could strengthen California's authority to enforce its own stricter regulations. California has a long history of pioneering environmental laws that predate federal actions, such as its own tailpipe emissions standards and renewable energy mandates. While the state's climate goals will face challenges from increased pollution elsewhere, the EPA's retreat could legally empower California to push its own climate agenda more aggressively.</p>

While Cramer praised Figma's strong business model, impressive revenue growth, and high-profile clients, he warned that its initial valuation is already expensive. He expressed concern that if the stock price soars immediately after its debut, it will become too overpriced to recommend. Cramer also noted that the enterprise software sector has recently shown weakness and that the company's planned heavy investment in AI could negatively impact profitability for several years.

The initiative, part of a "brownfield first" development approach, will begin with projects in Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, and Cambridge. A new development company, Platform4, will be formed to consolidate efforts and attract private investment to create new communities with homes, shops, and green spaces. However, industry groups have raised concerns that the plan faces significant hurdles, including existing backlogs and planning delays that are already holding up tens of thousands of other housing projects.</p>

While talks broke down acrimoniously, both sides have indicated a willingness to return to negotiations to address non-pay issues such as exam fees, career progression, and student loan debt.

          <p>Atmospheric scientists are warning that air travel is becoming bumpier, with both the frequency and intensity of severe turbulence expected to increase significantly in the coming decades due to climate change. A warmer atmosphere is creating more intense thunderstorms and strengthening the jet stream, both of which are major causes of turbulence. One study projects a potential doubling or tripling of severe turbulence, which can cause injuries and adds economic costs for airlines through delays, diversions, and maintenance. While aircraft are built to withstand turbulence, passengers are advised to keep their seatbelts fastened whenever seated.</p>

          <p>Recent polling indicates that tax cuts, once a reliable political winner, are becoming increasingly unpopular with the American public. A new Wall Street Journal poll shows a majority of Americans oppose the latest Republican tax cut bill, a sentiment consistent with the negative reaction to the 2017 Trump tax cuts. This shift may be due to several factors, including lower overall tax burdens compared to past decades, rising income inequality, and a growing awareness that tax cuts for the wealthy do not pay for themselves and contribute to the national debt. However, this does not necessarily mean voters are ready to embrace tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>
