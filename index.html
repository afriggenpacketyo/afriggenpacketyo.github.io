          <p>The second week of Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial commenced with testimony from individuals within his inner circle, aiming to corroborate Cassie Ventura's allegations of abuse and threats. Dawn Richard, a former Danity Kane member, testified to witnessing Combs physically assault Ventura, while Kerry Morgan, Ventura's former best friend, recounted instances of Combs' violent behavior. Combs' former assistant, David James, described the demanding atmosphere of working for the rap mogul, referring to Combs' enterprise as a 'kingdom'. Combs has pleaded not guilty, denying sex trafficking and racketeering charges, claiming any abuse or drug use does not equate to sexual assault or trafficking. </p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, appointed by President Trump as the Kennedy Center's president, alleged financial improprieties within the organization, claiming to have found 'phantom revenue' and 'fake revenue' that he deemed 'criminal' and intended to refer to federal prosecutors. This announcement coincided with the unveiling of the center's upcoming season, which notably included some nonunion Broadway productions, a shift Grenell defended as providing more options for audiences. The season will feature 'The Outsiders,' but not 'Hamilton,' which canceled its run due to dismay over Trump's takeover.

Juan Miguel Regalado received a 66-month sentence, while Samuel Grajeda Jr. was sentenced to 30 months plus six months for violating supervised release. Regalado once crashed a vehicle into the Rio Grande to evade law enforcement, and both were involved in another pursuit where Grajeda crashed into a bystander's vehicle.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing the end of legal protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation.

          <p>The federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has been dismissed by U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, while U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver has been charged with assaulting law enforcement during the same protest at an ICE facility. Habba stated that the dismissal of the charge against Baraka was for the sake of moving forward. McIver claims the charges against her are politically motivated and a mischaracterization of her actions. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a statement saying the decision to charge McIver came after "a thorough review of the video footage of Delaney Hall."\n</p>

          <p>A misdemeanor trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has been dropped, while an assault charge has been filed against U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver. The charges stem from a visit to an immigrant detention center, with Baraka and McIver maintaining the actions were part of a legislative inspection. The U.S. Attorney stated the decision to charge McIver was based on her alleged assault, impeding, and interfering with law enforcement. The arrest of Baraka was seen as an aggressive stance by the Trump administration against officials resisting its immigration crackdown. </p>

          <p>The Senate has advanced a crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins after initial Democratic opposition over concerns about President Trump's ties to the digital asset industry. The measure moved forward with bipartisan support after negotiators addressed some concerns. Senator Mark Warner advocated for the measure, calling it a 'meaningful step forward,' while Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed concerns that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. The bill aims to provide clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation. </p>
