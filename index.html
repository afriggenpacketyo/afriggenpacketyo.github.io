        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have achieved a milestone by developing the 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip. This chip aims to address the soaring computational demands of AI and data centers. With a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, it rivals advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development is particularly significant given US export controls that restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. The article suggests that optical computing could offer a path to overcome the limitations of traditional electronic chips. The advancement is seen as crucial for China's technological self-sufficiency and global competitiveness. </p>

          <h2>Ceasefire Announced Between Israel and Iran After Week of Aerial Attacks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 00:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a week of aerial attacks between Israel and Iran, President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between the two countries, although Iranian officials offered a less definitive confirmation. The agreement stipulates a staggered halt to strikes, with Iran ceasing attacks on Israel first, followed by Israel halting strikes on Iran. The conflict began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, leading to retaliatory attacks from Iran. Qatar played a role in brokering the deal, with direct and indirect communication channels facilitated by various administration officials. The conflict has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides, and the future of Iran's nuclear program remains uncertain. Optimism regarding the long-term implications of the ceasefire is guarded, as underlying tensions persist in the region. </p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the attack resulted in no reported casualties, raising hopes for de-escalation. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant declines, dropping below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran. The strike was in response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the missiles, preventing any casualties. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate, with some suggesting President Trump has successfully used a 'peace through strength' strategy. The market's reaction indicates a sentiment that the situation is being contained. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's rare earth dominance is significantly supported by supplies from Myanmar, a country with a war-torn economy. Myanmar accounts for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports, particularly heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium. These elements are vital for high-tech manufacturing, including defense, aerospace, and renewables sectors. However, the extraction process in Myanmar has high environmental costs, and the country's instability poses supply chain risks for China. Disruptions in Myanmar due to civil conflict have already caused spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A brutal heat wave is expected to settle in across the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has called it "the first significant heat wave this season," with people from the Midwest to the East Coast expected to experience record maximum and minimum temperatures. More than 150 million Americans are under extreme heat alerts, with the total number affected rising to about 200 million. The heat wave is caused by a heat dome, an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity. Staying indoors with air conditioning and staying hydrated are key to staying safe during the heat wave.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning. The court lifted an injunction issued by a federal District Court judge in Massachusetts that blocked the practice. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision. An official from Homeland Security praised the ruling, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants expressed concern over the stripping of due process protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the US in the conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire. The announcement followed US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with Iran stating it would halt attacks if Israel did so by a specific time. While the agreement may not be formally called a ceasefire, both parties appear to be de-escalating. This development comes after Iran retaliated for the US strikes, with no reported casualties or damage at the US base in Qatar.</p>

Republicans praised Trump's negotiating prowess and foreign policy skills. Democrats, such as Rep.

Thomas Massie said he would not seek to advance a resolution requiring Trump to gain congressional approval before attacking Iran, contingent on the ceasefire holding.</p>

Police detained 12 suspects after the incidents, which occurred during the Fête de la Musique. Officials are investigating whether these were cases of needle spiking with date-rape drugs, with some victims taken to the hospital for toxicological tests. The incident is reminiscent of similar events in June 2022, when suspects were detained for allegedly pricking people with needles in nightclubs and concerts.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in New York are concluding their case in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs. Combs is accused of using his power to facilitate sex trafficking and conceal his crimes, though he has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecution's case relies on laws once aimed at mob bosses. Witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, have testified about Combs' alleged abuse. Legal experts suggest the prosecution has presented a compelling case, but a conviction is not assured.</p>
