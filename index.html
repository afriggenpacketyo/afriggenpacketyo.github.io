          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin, pledging to resolve their long-standing border disputes. This marks Modi's first visit to China since deadly border clashes in 2020 strained relations between the two nations. Both leaders emphasized focusing on economic development and partnership rather than rivalry, aiming for a stable and healthy bilateral relationship. The meeting occurred ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, highlighting a diplomatic push to rebuild ties and resume dialogue, flights, and trade discussions.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea could be transformed into a submarine "kill zone." The plan involves using intelligent sea mines hidden in "acoustic shadow zones" created by underwater mountains, which would make them difficult for sonar to detect. According to the researchers, this strategy could effectively target enemy vessels and challenge U.S. naval dominance in the region. The study emphasizes that precise placement of these underwater assets is crucial for enhancing maritime security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity for matcha has led to significant supply shortages and record-high prices, even in its native Japan. Driven by its reputation as a superfood on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom, demand for the green tea powder has skyrocketed. Japanese tea producers are struggling to keep up due to an aging farming workforce and the labor-intensive process of growing tencha, the specific tea used for matcha. Consequently, retailers are rationing supplies and prices have doubled, while major companies are creating dedicated divisions to manage the intense competition for sourcing the product.</p>

          <p>As investors return from summer holidays, they face September, historically the stock market's worst-performing month. Despite the S&P 500 and Dow Jones reaching record highs in August, historical data suggests a potential downturn for major indices. Analysts offer mixed outlooks; some believe the bull market will continue, supported by a potential economic soft landing and solid earnings. Others are more cautious, pointing to underlying economic pressures and a potential slowdown in the second half of the year before a rebound in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

Her success began with hustles like trading Pokémon cards and culminated in co-founding Scale AI, which was acquired by Meta. Guo dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, a decision that initially disappointed her immigrant parents.

          <p>New figures from England's Department for Education reveal a strong correlation between missing school in the first week of term and long-term absence. The data from 2024 showed that 57% of pupils who were absent during the first week later became "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of school, compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat what she called critically high absence levels post-pandemic. The government is implementing "attendance and behaviour hubs" to support struggling schools.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has called her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad "by far the best decision I have ever made." The 32-year-old stated she was on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown after a demanding season where she led Chelsea to a domestic treble. Bright, who has since had knee surgery and started counseling, emphasized the importance of prioritizing her well-being over pleasing others. She now feels "back to life" and is mentally and physically prepared for the upcoming Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>A Guardian opinion article suggests that the UK's Reform party is importing Donald Trump's tactics of hostility towards the press, citing a recent ban on the Nottingham Post by the Reform-led Nottinghamshire county council. The author argues this is part of a broader trend where hard-right politicians feel they can shun traditional media engagement without electoral consequences, instead using the press as a foil. However, the article also notes that figures like Nigel Farage, similar to Trump, still strategically use mainstream media to their advantage. The piece concludes that dodging local scrutiny could backfire for a party trying to prove its governing competence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1 in a game marked by uncharacteristic mistakes and an inability to support pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow pitched a no-hitter into the sixth inning but ultimately took the loss as the Dodgers' offense failed to score and the defense committed costly errors. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration, stating "We beat ourselves" and calling the team's performance "unrecognizable" due to a lack of focus and execution. The loss narrows the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just one game.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has stated his ambition to create a transaction system for virtual assets that could rival the traditional Swift network. In an interview, Sun predicted that transactions facilitated through Tron, which he expects to reach $8 trillion this year, could exceed Swift's volume within five years. He highlighted Tron's ability to process transactions in seconds compared to the days it can take Swift. Sun's confidence is based on Tron's growing dominance in the global stablecoin market, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters marched in cities across Mexico to demand government action and justice for the more than 130,000 people who are officially registered as missing. Relatives of the disappeared, carrying photos of their loved ones, called on President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration to address the crisis. Most disappearances have occurred since the "war on drugs" began in 2007, with both drug cartels and security forces being blamed. Activist groups, known as "buscadores," often conduct dangerous searches for clandestine graves, highlighting a national tragedy the UN has called one of "enormous proportions."</p>

          <p>This article profiles Alix Tichelman, who was charged with manslaughter in the 2013 heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. The case came to light after security footage from Hayes' yacht showed Tichelman with him on the night he died. Investigators say the video captured her injecting Hayes with heroin and then leaving without seeking help when he lost consciousness. Before this incident, Tichelman's then-boyfriend, a nightclub owner, had also died of a heroin overdose in her presence. Police ultimately arrested Tichelman in a sting operation where they posed as a "sugar daddy" client.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the company of being complicit in federal immigration raids. Her opposition follows several recent raids by federal agents targeting day laborers and vendors in the parking lot of a Westlake Home Depot. Jurado stated that Home Depot's silence on the matter makes it complicit in the "terror" inflicted on the community. A spokesperson for Home Depot responded that the company is not notified of planned ICE operations and is required to follow all federal and local regulations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to bar city departments, including the police, from cooperating with such federal actions and urges federal agents to wear clear identification and not wear masks. This move comes as the city prepares for what the mayor called "militarized activity" by the Trump administration. While largely symbolic, the order signals the city's intent to use all available legal avenues to resist federal overreach and protect its residents.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking the most points the team has scored in a game since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, never punting and recording three plays of over 60 yards, while the defense registered five sacks and a pick-six. While the dominant performance provided a strong start, the lopsided nature of the game against a much weaker opponent offered little insight into how the team will fare against tougher competition.</p>
