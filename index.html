          <p>Snap's stock price plummeted 11% after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties affecting advertising demand. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel noted headwinds at the start of the current quarter and emphasized balancing investment with revenue growth. The company's first-quarter revenue increased by 14% to $1.36 billion, with a net loss of $140 million, which was an improvement from the previous year. Snap anticipates daily active users to reach 468 million in the second quarter, and like other tech companies, Snap is navigating a turbulent economic landscape with evolving trade policies.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the Trump administration has finalized a trade deal but is awaiting approval from the other country's prime minister and parliament, though he did not disclose the country's identity. The stock market responded positively to the comments, as Wall Street closely monitors trade negotiation progress. Lutnick clarified that the deal does not involve China, as those negotiations are managed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This announcement follows President Trump's implementation of widespread tariff hikes, many of which have been temporarily paused, and increased U.S. manufacturing is one of Lutnick's stated goals for the Trump administration's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>UPS plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting initiative linked to delivering fewer packages for Amazon, its largest customer. The layoffs will affect slightly over 4% of UPS's workforce, and the company also intends to close 73 facilities by the end of June 2025, with potential for additional closures. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion this year through these consolidations, and the company stated that this reduction in package volume from Amazon is a strategic decision to focus on revenue quality and profitability. UPS also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business, and the company is keeping customers abreast of tariff developments on its website.</p>

The janitors claim to have suffered physical injuries and PTSD and have been unable to return to work, and former Attorney General Bill Barr is representing the janitors.

          <p>The ongoing U.S. Department of Justice antitrust case against Google has shifted its focus to artificial intelligence, with the DOJ arguing that Google could use its AI products to strengthen its search engine monopoly. The DOJ is proposing remedies that address how users access Google search, including Gemini, to prevent Google from monopolizing the AI market. The government contends that Google's control over search provides it with a competitive advantage in AI development due to access to vast amounts of user data, and Google rejects the argument that it could monopolize the field of generative AI, citing healthy competition.</p>

          <p>The Anaheim Ducks announced a $1 billion renovation of Honda Center, including a new parking policy designed to eliminate transaction times and improve fan access. The renovations include a grand entrance, expanded concessions, and new parking garages, and the project aligns with Anaheim's bid to host Olympic volleyball in 2028. The Ducks' owners are funding the project, and the innovation contrasts with the stalled negotiations between the city and the Angels over stadium improvements.</p>

          <p>Democrats believe President Trump's first 100 days have created an opportunity to win back the House in 2026, citing public dissatisfaction with Trump and congressional Republicans. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) argues that Republicans have broken promises to lower costs and that their budget could lead to cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans remain confident they will hold the House and celebrate Trump's agenda, while Democrats are planning to hold a virtual town hall about "how Democratic governors are standing up to protect the people in their states."</p>

          <p>The investigation into the death of Kendy Howard, who was found in a bathtub with a gunshot wound, took a turn when authorities noted an unfinished dryer cycle. Investigators determined that the dryer was started approximately one minute before the 911 call was made, which raised suspicions about the events leading up to her death. Additional clues included broken glass, wet towels, and a packed duffle bag, and Dan Howard was later arrested and tried for the murder of his wife.</p>

          <p>President Trump personally contacted Jeff Bezos to express his displeasure regarding a report that Amazon was considering displaying U.S. tariff costs on its product listings. Shortly after, Amazon downplayed the plan before ultimately scrapping it, and the White House had previously criticized Amazon over the idea, calling it a hostile and political act. The incident occurred amid growing scrutiny of Amazon's business practices and its relationship with the Trump administration, as well as increasing pressure from tariffs, especially on goods sourced from China.</p>
