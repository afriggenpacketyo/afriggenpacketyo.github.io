          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has revised its COVID-19 vaccine guidelines, narrowing eligibility for the latest shots. Previously available to nearly everyone aged 6 months and older, the updated vaccines are now restricted to individuals at higher risk of severe complications, specifically those aged 65 and over or with underlying health issues. This change marks a significant shift from the broad accessibility that characterized earlier vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. NPR is currently soliciting public questions to be addressed by a medical expert to clarify the implications of this new policy.</p>

          <p>The political landscape for the 2026 U.S. Senate midterm elections is beginning to solidify, with Democrats facing a challenging map to gain a majority. Republicans are defending 24 seats compared to the Democrats' 13, and many GOP incumbents are in states that former President Trump won, limiting Democratic pickup opportunities. Key battlegrounds are emerging in states like North Carolina, Georgia, and Michigan, where retirements and competitive primaries are creating pivotal contests. The outcomes in these states will likely determine which party controls the Senate for the latter half of the presidential term.</p>

The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share and revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year, signaling robust consumer spending and transaction frequency. CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in the company's performance and its ability to manage loan repayments effectively. Despite losing Walmart as a partner, Affirm's growth was bolstered by strong partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, as well as significant expansion of its Affirm Card usage.

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares climbed nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, driven by accelerated growth in its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, largely fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors responded positively to the cloud division's performance and the continued recovery of its e-commerce business.

          <p>An administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner, whose house was destroyed in a fire, can investigate State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a 17% emergency increase granted in May. This ruling connects the insurer's service quality directly to its rate-setting process, a move supported by consumer advocacy groups who argue against rate increases until claim disputes are resolved.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for the permanent transfer of Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old, who had a successful loan spell with Betis last season, has been given permission to travel for his medical examination. Antony was one of several players training separately from the main squad, signaling the club's intent to move him this summer. The transfer marks the end of a disappointing tenure at United for the player, who was the club's second-most expensive signing at £81.3 million but struggled to perform consistently in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Marvell Technology shares fell by 18% after the chipmaker's data center revenue for the fiscal second quarter missed analyst estimates and the company provided a lackluster forecast for the upcoming quarter. While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, driven by AI demand, sales in the key data center segment were slightly below projections. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the flat sequential forecast for the data center business to the "lumpiness" of custom AI chip orders from large cloud providers.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Russia is concentrating up to 100,000 troops for a new large-scale offensive in the eastern Donbas region, specifically near the strategic town of Pokrovsk. While acknowledging the buildup, Zelensky asserted that Ukraine is prepared and the situation remains under control. Simultaneously, Russian Defence Minister Andrey Belousov claimed that Moscow's campaign is accelerating, with Russian forces capturing more territory monthly. Belousov also reported significant damage to Ukraine's military infrastructure from recent airstrikes, though casualty and territorial claims from both sides cannot be independently verified.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a slight downturn on Friday, causing the S&P 500 to end a four-week winning streak, but the index still closed out August with a gain of roughly 2%. The week's decline was partly driven by profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a drop in Nvidia's stock, which fell despite a strong earnings report. The market also digested the latest PCE inflation data, which showed persistent price pressures but did not derail expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Overall, August was a positive month for equities, extending a period of gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the recovery of the body of Ilan Weiss, a 56-year-old Israeli hostage, during an operation in the Gaza Strip. Weiss was killed on October 7, 2023, while defending Kibbutz Beeri, and his body was subsequently taken into Gaza by Hamas. His wife and daughter were also taken hostage but were released in November 2023. The remains of a second, unidentified hostage were also found in the same operation. The recovery comes as the Israeli military intensifies its operations around Gaza City, and domestic pressure continues to mount on the government to secure the release of all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has filed a motion to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, arguing his appointment is unlawful. The motion contends that the Trump administration used an unprecedented legal maneuver to keep Essayli in his post beyond his initial term without Senate or judicial confirmation. This challenge was filed as part of a motion to dismiss an indictment, asserting that Essayli had no lawful authority when it was obtained. Similar legal challenges are underway against other Trump-appointed prosecutors in states like New Jersey and Nevada, raising questions about the validity of cases brought by these offices.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unveiled a clearer picture of one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, an ancient ankylosaur named Spicomellus that lived 165 million years ago. Based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco, the herbivorous dinosaur had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This "punk rocker" dinosaur also possessed a tail weapon, making its armor far more elaborate than previously expected for such an early ankylosaur. The discovery is so unusual that it may force scientists to reassess their theories about the evolution of this tank-like group of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won a decisive reelection victory four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of town hall and refused to recognize his 2020 win. Braxton won with 66 votes to his opponent's 26 in the town's first mayoral election since at least the 1960s, which was held as part of a federal lawsuit settlement. For decades, the town's leadership was passed down by appointment, resulting in a white government in a majority-Black town. Braxton's victory is seen as a restoration of democratic governance and a significant moment for the small community.</p>

          <p>After a decade of focusing on original music and smaller, more intimate tours, "Weird Al" Yankovic is returning to his signature large-scale productions featuring costumes, props, and his famous song parodies. Yankovic explains he took a break from parodies partly because the decline of a pop "monoculture" made hit songs less obvious targets, and he wanted to prove his versatility with original pastiches. Now, with his "Bigger & Weirder" tour, he has re-embraced the full spectacle, expanding his band to replicate the layered sounds of the songs he satirizes. He says the break "cleansed the palate" and has renewed his enthusiasm for the elaborate shows his fans expect.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a new congressional map designed to strengthen the Republican party's hold on the state's U.S. House seats. The mid-decade redistricting effort, pushed by the Trump administration, could allow the GOP to flip up to five seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats and voting rights groups have fiercely opposed the new map, arguing it unfairly marginalizes voters of color, and have already filed legal challenges. The move in Texas comes as other states, including California, are also considering redrawing their own maps, setting the stage for intense partisan battles over congressional representation.</p>

          <p>An upcoming temporary closure of the "Americans and the Holocaust" exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for an "upgrade" has reportedly sparked concern among some staff members. The exhibit, which takes a critical view of the U.S. response to Nazi Germany, is scheduled to close from September 2025 to February 2026. According to sources, some staff are worried about potential editorial changes, especially in light of President Trump's review of museum content and his recent replacement of several museum board members. A museum spokesperson stated the closure is for maintenance and technical updates with "no changes to the editorial content."</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months. The election, set for May 2026, could determine the balance of power in the chamber, where Democrats currently hold a slim 19-18 majority. A Republican victory would create a tie, potentially allowing the GOP to block parts of the Democratic governor's agenda in her final year. Whitmer had faced criticism from Republicans and some Democrats for the long delay in calling the election for the 35th Senate District, which was previously held by a Democrat who was elected to Congress.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experienced a week of chaos following the abrupt firing of its director, Susan Monarez, after less than a month in the position. The dismissal reportedly stemmed from a clash with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what her lawyers called "unscientific, reckless directives." In protest, three other top CDC leaders, including the chief medical officer, also resigned. Kennedy has appointed one of his top HHS advisors, Jim O'Neill, as acting director, a move that has raised concerns due to O'Neill's lack of a medical or scientific background.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cut $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress had already allocated for the current fiscal year. The White House is using a rarely attempted budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," which requests to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that they may expire before Congress can act. The proposed cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including funding for international peacekeeping and democracy promotion. The move is expected to face legal challenges and has drawn criticism from lawmakers who argue it unconstitutionally bypasses Congress's power of the purse.</p>
