          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating trade tensions days before a negotiation deadline. In a letter, Trump linked the new tariffs to Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl trafficking and existing trade imbalances, though data shows most fentanyl enters the US via the Mexican border. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated his government will continue to protect its workers and businesses while working toward a new trade deal. The threat adds to existing US tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a celebrated IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association over planned strikes by resident doctors in the UK. He argued that the five-day walkout over pay, scheduled for late July, is ill-timed as the country struggles and could damage public trust in the medical profession. The BMA states the strike is necessary as the government refuses to negotiate on pay, which they claim is 20% lower in real terms than in 2008. Lord Winston emphasized that doctors must consider their responsibility to vulnerable patients.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by Princeton University's Bridging Divides Initiative reveals that threats and harassment against local school officials have increased by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers found that initial conflicts over mask mandates evolved into disputes over cultural issues, such as diversity initiatives and LGBTQ+ policies, fueled by misinformation. The report, which surveyed over 820 school board members, indicates that officials across the political spectrum are being targeted. The escalating hostility is causing concern that it may deter individuals from public service or engaging in controversial but necessary topics.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the Yangtze. The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species in the river's upper reaches. For decades, the dense network of dams has fragmented the river, blocking fish migration routes and drastically reducing water flow, sometimes causing sections to dry up entirely. This project seeks to reverse the ecological damage and save the last refuge for many unique aquatic species.</p>

The NAO also estimated the final cost to expand the fleet could be over three times the Ministry of Defence's forecast.

          <h2>Federal Judge Again Blocks Trump's Order to End Birthright Citizenship</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, temporarily halting the order from taking effect while the legal challenge proceeds. This ruling comes after a recent Supreme Court decision that limited the use of nationwide injunctions but still allowed them through specific legal avenues like class-action suits. The White House criticized the decision, vowing to fight what it called an unlawful attempt to impede the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, has filed an administrative complaint seeking $20 million in damages from the Trump administration. The complaint alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress stemming from his three-month detention by ICE, which his lawyers call a retaliatory action for his protected speech. Khalil, who was a key negotiator during campus protests, was detained as the administration sought his deportation over purported national security risks. He has stated he would accept an official apology and policy change in lieu of the monetary damages.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. Bianchi, now 74, and his cousin Angelo Buono Jr. were responsible for the murders of 12 women in the 1970s, where they impersonated police officers to lure victims before sexually assaulting and killing them. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, the board ruled that Bianchi will not be eligible for another parole hearing for 10 years. Buono, his accomplice in the crimes, died in prison back in 2002.</p>

The rock, named NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet and was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023. Scientists believe it was dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles to Earth. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, making this a significant opportunity for collectors and a valuable dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

In a recent incident, an Israeli strike near a health clinic in central Gaza killed at least 15 Palestinians, including 10 children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements. The aid group Project HOPE condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international law. The Israeli military stated the strike targeted a terrorist operative who participated in the October 7th attack and said it was investigating the harm caused to uninvolved individuals.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made a remarkable and unlikely fossil discovery on its own property. While drilling a deep borehole to study geothermal heating potential, a sample from over 750 feet below the museum's parking lot revealed a dinosaur vertebra. Curators described the find as incredibly rare, likening it to a hole-in-one from the moon. The bone is believed to be from a small, plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago. The unique fossil is now on display for visitors at the museum.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, on the same day his company became the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. While the meeting's agenda was not disclosed, Nvidia has been navigating U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, which have effectively cut off sales to the significant Chinese market. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance, attributing its 47% rise to his tariff policies. The administration is also considering newer, simpler restrictions on which countries can receive Nvidia's powerful AI technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on Brazil, partly in retaliation for the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, relies on a contested interpretation of his executive authority. The administration is citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same law at the center of a federal lawsuit challenging his broader tariff agenda. Critics argue this move is an abuse of power, as the law is intended for genuine national emergencies. The claim is further complicated by the fact that the U.S. maintains a trade surplus with Brazil, contradicting the administration's stated rationale of trade deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political strategist claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans after analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. In his new book, Chris Bruni-Lowe identifies eight words that consistently resonate with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. He describes these words not as a guarantee of victory, but as "emotional shortcuts" or building blocks that work across different cultures and political ideologies. The analysis suggests these powerful words can be bent to fit various narratives, from conservative to socialist campaigns, to connect with voters on an instinctive level.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult novel 'Trainspotting,' is releasing a new sequel and has shared his thoughts on modern culture. He expresses concern that the internet, social media, and AI are creating a "post-culture society" where people become "dumbed down machines" by letting technology think for them. Welsh feels a nostalgia for the 1990s, an era he believes was more culturally vibrant and less controlled by technology. His new novel, 'Men in Love,' explores his characters' lives immediately after the original book, focusing on love as an antidote to a world he sees as full of hate.</p>
