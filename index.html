          <h2>Senators Voice Concerns Over Potential HHS Cuts Impacting Indian Health Service</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, and Lisa Murkowski, have sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expressing concerns that proposed cuts to the agency could severely impact the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators highlighted the vulnerability of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who already face significant health disparities and have the lowest life expectancy in the U.S. They urged Secretary Kennedy to ensure that IHS programs have the necessary resources and staffing to fulfill their missions, emphasizing the need for meaningful tribal consultation before implementing any actions affecting tribal health care delivery. The senators also noted that a hiring freeze is worsening existing staffing shortages, including a need for laboratory technicians and administrative personnel.</p>

          <p>Buster Murdaugh, the surviving son of Alex Murdaugh, married Brooklynn White in a lavish ceremony at Coosaw Point in Beaufort, South Carolina, on May 3. The wedding took place against the backdrop of Alex Murdaugh's legal troubles, including his conviction for the 2021 murders of his wife and younger son, as well as financial crimes. Buster Murdaugh has publicly maintained his father's innocence, arguing that law enforcement rushed to judgment due to intense media scrutiny. White has been a consistent source of support for Buster throughout his father's trials. Alex Murdaugh is currently serving a life sentence for the murders and a 27-year sentence for financial crimes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting noncitizens to Libya or Saudi Arabia without due process would violate an existing court order, following reports that the Trump administration considered such plans. The ruling came after lawyers representing a group of migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent their deportation to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing concerns about their safety and allegations that they were being prepared for removal on military aircraft. The judge clarified that any imminent removals to countries like Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month, which bars the administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their place of origin without due process. The Government of National Unity in Libya has denied any involvement in the reported deportation plans.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means as the next Surgeon General, replacing his initial nominee, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Trump cited Dr. Means' strong "MAHA" (Make America Healthy Again) credentials and her alignment with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda. The previous nominee, Dr. Nesheiwat, faced scrutiny regarding the accuracy of her resume and concerns about her ideological alignment with the president. She will reportedly work with Mr. Kennedy in another capacity within the HHS. This decision follows criticism from conservative activists and questions surrounding Dr. Nesheiwat's qualifications, leading to the swift replacement.</p>

          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7, U.S. travelers are required to present a Real ID or another acceptable form of identification, such as a passport, at airport security checkpoints for domestic travel. Despite initial concerns about potential delays, many airports reported relatively smooth operations on the first day of the new requirement. The TSA has deployed additional staff to assist travelers and verify identities using secondary processes for those without a Real ID. While travelers can still apply for a Real ID, officials advise arriving at least three hours before a domestic flight, especially without compliant identification, and the Better Business Bureau is warning travelers to be aware of potential Real ID scams.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes plans to cut funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which aids low-income seniors, and replace it with "MAHA food boxes" sourced directly from farmers. The USDA claims the MAHA boxes would provide more wholesome foods and eliminate administrative middlemen. However, concerns have been raised about the logistical challenges of delivering perishable food directly to seniors and whether the boxes would meet their specific dietary needs. Critics also argue that the current CSFP program already provides healthy options and is essential for seniors who struggle to access grocery stores, and the MAHA initiative is part of a broader effort by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to promote natural foods and alternative medicines.</p>

The officers were members of the since-disbanded Scorpion Task Force and were found guilty of federal charges, including witness tampering, in a separate trial. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump called the verdicts "a devastating miscarriage of justice", and the US Justice Department previously found that the Memphis Police Department regularly used excessive force against black residents.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced its wettest May on record after a series of storms brought heavy rainfall to the city for four consecutive days. The unusual weather event caused widespread flooding, with streets submerged and water flowing through parking garages on the Strip. In Henderson, a man was swept away by floodwaters, prompting rescue efforts by firefighters and police officers. The heavy rains were attributed to a slow-moving low-pressure system interacting with moisture from the Pacific Ocean. Dry weather and warmer temperatures are forecast for the coming days.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has invoked the state-secrets privilege in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador, to withhold information regarding his removal and any efforts to return him to the United States. Abrego Garcia's legal team accuses the administration of failing to comply with court orders to facilitate his return. The Justice Department has cited attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege, and certain executive privileges to protect information, particularly concerning any arrangements regarding the government's use of El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). The judge has ordered the administration to justify each privilege claim, and depositions of Homeland Security and State Department officials are to be completed by Friday.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has been notably absent from the White House, spending fewer than 14 days there since her husband's inauguration 108 days ago. She has been spending extended periods in Trump Tower in Manhattan or Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Administration officials say she is at the White House more often than the public knows, but when exactly, and for how long, these officials will not (or perhaps cannot) say for certain.

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers, Demetrius Haley, Tadarrius Bean, and Justin Smith, were acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of Tyre Nichols, a Black man who was brutally beaten during a traffic stop in 2023. The jury, seated from the Chattanooga area, deliberated for over eight hours after a seven-day trial. The officers had been convicted of witness tampering in a separate federal trial, but acquitted of a more serious charge of violating Mr. Nicholsâ€™s civil rights by causing his death. Two other former officers involved in the beating took guilty pleas in the earlier federal case.</p>

Uber also reported a net income of around $1.78 billion, or 83 cents per share, for the first quarter, up from a net loss of $654 million, or a loss of 32 cents per share, a year earlier.
