        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is facing significant headwinds, including increased competition and consumer backlash, further exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public dispute with President Trump. The feud, stemming from policy disagreements over Trump's spending bill, has escalated into personal attacks, causing Tesla's stock to plummet and erasing billions in market value. This fallout jeopardizes Tesla's relationship with the administration, potentially impacting regulations, investigations, and government support. Critics call for Tesla's board to ensure the company's stability independent of Musk, especially as Tesla struggles with innovation, quality issues, and the rollout of autonomous vehicle technology. Optimus robotics is also experiencing changes with Milan Kovac, Tesla's vice president of Optimus robotics, announcing he was leaving after joining the company in 2016.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was apprehended after escaping from an Arkansas prison where he was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, has been brought back to the United States to face charges of illegally transporting migrants within the country. A federal grand jury indicted Garcia for allegedly participating in a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas, with accusations of involvement in over 100 trips. The decision to prosecute Garcia led to the resignation of a federal prosecutor, citing political motivations. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador for their cooperation in returning Garcia, who faces a maximum of 10 years imprisonment for each migrant transported. </p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a team spearheaded by Elon Musk, access to sensitive Social Security Administration records during ongoing legal challenges. The conservative-majority court lifted an injunction, allowing DOGE to access the data for its mission to target waste and fraud. Critics, including labor unions and advocacy groups, argue this move threatens Americans' privacy and could allow misuse of personal data. The lawsuit against DOGE seeks to protect the personal information of millions of Americans, including financial and medical history.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional, deeming the teaching of yoga "protected speech".

The city argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as the instructors' classes draw donations.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency that analyzes the budgetary impacts of bills, is under fire from Republicans after projecting that their signature legislation would increase federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over a decade. The CBO was established in 1974 to provide lawmakers with objective information about the budgetary impacts of proposed bills, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. The CBO's work is advisory, and the agency makes no policy recommendations; it's up to lawmakers to decide what to do with the information they receive. While the CBO is more accurate than critics suggest, projecting how new tax changes will affect the economic decisions of 330 million Americans is extraordinarily complicated, and there's always going to be a margin of error.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo's campaign for New York City mayor received a surprising endorsement from rival Jessica Ramos, despite her past criticisms of his mental acuity and allegations of misconduct. Ramos cited Cuomo's experience and ability to stand up to the Trump administration as reasons for her support. The endorsement comes after Cuomo faced attacks during a mayoral debate over his handling of nursing home deaths and sexual harassment allegations. Ramos's decision has been met with dismay from progressive allies, while Cuomo has stated he will not endorse Ramos in return.</p>

          <p>Enrique Tarrio, former leader of the Proud Boys, and other members convicted for their role in the January 6 Capitol attack are suing the federal government, alleging violations of their rights. The lawsuit claims FBI agents and prosecutors acted with personal malice during the investigation and charging process, citing evidence tampering and witness intimidation. The plaintiffs, who received pardons or commutations from Donald Trump, seek compensatory and punitive damages for alleged mistreatment during detention and violations of attorney-client privilege. They contend that their actions did not involve obstructing proceedings or planning violence.</p>

DDG has made serious allegations about Bailey in a new court filing, alleging that she is emotionally unstable, has made threats of suicide and self-harm, and has endangered their son. The court denied DDG's request to prevent Bailey from taking their son out of the country, but will consider the request at a hearing later this month. Both sides accuse the other of physical altercations, and Bailey claims DDG has "badmouthed" her to his millions of fans on Twitch and YouTube.</p>

          <p>While most commentary gives President Donald Trump the advantage in the Musk-Trump blowup, Elon Musk’s willingness to spend his fortune on elections gives him one distinct advantage: the ability to drive a brittle party system into chaos and loosen Trump’s hold on it. Musk has raised two electoral threats: his opposition to Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill has raised the specter of his funding primary challenges against Republicans who vote to support the legislation, and he has raised the possibility of starting a new political party. Even so, a Musk-powered independent party would almost certainly attract exactly the voters completely disenchanted with both parties, mostly the disillusioned young men who went to Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>The public falling out between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could have significant implications for the Republican Party. Musk's opposition to Trump's legislative agenda and his suggestion of forming a new political party present a challenge to the existing political landscape. While Trump maintains a strong base, Musk's wealth and influence could fund primary challengers or third-party candidates, potentially disrupting elections in key swing states. This disruption could exploit the narrow margins in national elections and alter the balance of power, particularly in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

The energetic dispatch “We Are Guardians” from directors Edivan Guajajara, Chelsea Greene and Rob Grobman, is the latest advocacy feature to bring cameras into the Amazon to juxtapose beauty and devastation. Even a wealthy landowner can come off like a victim here, as is the case with Tadeu, a businessman who in the 1990s started an ecological sanctuary on his 28,000 hectares, and whose complaints to the Brazilian government about illegal encroachment on his land fall on deaf ears. There’s a comprehensiveness to how “We Are Guardians” lays out a big, knotty problem of environment, politics, geography and business — internationalized yet hyper-local — while spotlighting the Indigenous push-back efforts.</p>
