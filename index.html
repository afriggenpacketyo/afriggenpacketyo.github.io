          <p>India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar urged BRICS members to tackle significant trade deficits, particularly with China, during a virtual summit. This call comes as the bloc navigates global trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs, which have affected member nations like India and Brazil. While India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative, China and Russia see it as a geopolitical grouping, leading to differing priorities within the alliance. New Delhi seeks expeditious solutions to these imbalances, which have seen its deficit with Beijing reach a record high.</p>

          <p>England, under coach Thomas Tuchel, is preparing for a challenging World Cup qualifier against Serbia in Belgrade, a match seen as a crucial test for the team's progress. Despite a flawless record in qualifying with four wins and no goals conceded, performances have been criticized as uninspired since Tuchel took over after Euro 2024. The team will face a hostile stadium atmosphere and a talented Serbian side, making this an ideal opportunity for Tuchel to impose his tactical vision and demonstrate the team's true capabilities.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison sentence, overturning his previous hospital detention for corruption and abuse of power. The decision addresses public criticism regarding perceived special treatment, as Thaksin had spent only hours in jail before being moved to a hospital suite. This ruling further impacts the influential Shinawatra political dynasty, coming shortly after his daughter Paetongtarn was removed from her prime ministerial role due to an ethics violation. Thaksin, who maintains his innocence, stated he would continue to serve his country with freedom of thought.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is nearing full commissioning, poised to double the country's electricity output, but it faces significant controversies. Reports suggest up to 15,000 deaths occurred during its 14-year construction, a claim neither confirmed nor denied by the Water and Energy Minister. Funded entirely by Ethiopia through bonds and public donations due to geopolitical sensitivities, the project has united citizens but sparked ongoing disputes with downstream nations, Egypt and Sudan, over water security.

Experts suggest Russia aims to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, damage critical infrastructure, and instill panic among the population to hinder military recruitment. The escalating intensity indicates Russia's commitment to mass drone attacks and a lack of interest in an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, former head of NIH's NIAID, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging retaliation after clashing with Trump administration officials over vaccine research. She claims she was removed for opposing efforts to cancel vaccine clinical trials, particularly for the flu, and for raising concerns about statements from acting NIH director Dr. Matthew Memoli, which echoed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine skepticism. Marrazzo described Kennedy as "dangerous" for ignoring evidence and discrediting scientists, urging the public to trust reliable health sources.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Ruling on Immigration Raids Draws Strong Dissent Over Racial Profiling Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's silent blessing of immigration raids in Los Angeles, which allegedly target individuals based on appearance, language, and occupation, has drawn sharp criticism. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a powerful dissent, warning against living in a country where the government can seize people for looking Latino, speaking Spanish, and appearing to work low-wage jobs. The ruling permits federal agents to resume sweeps without particularized suspicion, bypassing traditional deliberative processes by using the emergency docket. Critics argue this decision undermines constitutional protections and normalizes suspicion as policy, particularly impacting immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A Chinese film depicting the Nanking massacre in 1937 has deeply moved audiences, prompting reflections on the historical suffering of the Chinese people during World War II. The article notes that while international media often interprets Chinese displays of strength as geopolitical moves, Chinese citizens view them as essential for national well-being, a sentiment echoed by a netizen who stated, "Only when the motherland is strong can we live a good life." The film's restrained storytelling, focusing on civilians risking their lives to expose atrocities, resonates deeply, highlighting a desire for their historical pain to be acknowledged.</p>

          <p>Syria's state news agency reported that Israel conducted air strikes in the central and western parts of the country, condemning them as a "blatant infringement" of its sovereignty. There was no immediate comment from Israel, though its defense minister previously stated forces operate in all combat zones for security. These alleged attacks follow dozens of previous Israeli strikes across Syria since the fall of ex-President Bashar al-Assad, which Israel claims are to prevent weapons from falling into extremist hands. No casualties were reported in this latest incident.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that over 400,000 mothers of young children left the U.S. workforce in the first half of 2025, marking the steepest decline in 40 years. Economist Misty Heggeness attributes this trend primarily to the overwhelming costs and demands of childcare, making it financially unfeasible for many mothers to work. This forces women to choose between their jobs and their children, highlighting a critical lack of policy support for caregivers. While the decision is often difficult, some mothers, like Mackenzie Bruegge, report finding greater happiness and a new rhythm at home.</p>

          <p>England's NHS trusts are now being ranked in new league tables, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital leading, while Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, ranks lowest due to structural issues. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to identify areas needing urgent support and end "postcode lottery" care. Trusts will be categorized quarterly, with top performers gaining more autonomy and struggling ones receiving support. However, NHS Providers raised concerns about the methodology's accuracy and potential for misdirected priorities, urging for clear, objective data that truly drives patient-focused improvements.</p>

          <p>Ofsted is proceeding with a new "report card" system for inspecting schools in England, replacing its previous one- or two-word grades, despite strong criticism from educators and campaigners. The change follows the suicide of head teacher Ruth Perry, which a coroner ruled was contributed to by an Ofsted inspection. The new system will use a five-point grading scale across seven areas, aiming for more detailed feedback for parents. Opponents, including Perry's sister, argue it's a "cosmetic rebranding" that retains high-stakes pressure and risks, calling for a delay and intervention from the Education Secretary.</p>

          <p>Immigrants in Los Angeles are expressing profound fear and dread following a Supreme Court order that permits the resumption of immigration raids, which critics argue are indiscriminate and racially motivated. The Department of Homeland Security declared it would "FLOOD THE ZONE" in Los Angeles, intensifying concerns among noncitizens and their families. Immigrant rights groups and Democratic politicians, including Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, denounced the ruling as "dangerous" and an "attack." Many fear increased aggression from agents and a rollback of constitutional protections, impacting communities where business has already slumped due to previous raids.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Significant Increase in Cannabis Use Among Older Americans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023. This rise is attributed to diminishing stigma and the perception of cannabis as a solution for various medicinal issues, with legalization expanding across many states. While some seniors report benefits for conditions like pain and PTSD, medical professionals like Professor Matt Springer warn of potential health risks, including increased cardiovascular disease, regardless of consumption method. Users like Don Searles acknowledge the risks but question what isn't considered harmful nowadays.</p>
