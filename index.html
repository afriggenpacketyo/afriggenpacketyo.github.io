          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 11:25:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a strategic partnership to co-develop chips for data centers and PCs, causing Intel's stock to surge significantly. This collaboration aims to merge Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing expertise with Intel's CPU architecture and the broader x86 ecosystem. The investment follows recent financial support for Intel's turnaround efforts from both the U.S. government and Softbank, signaling growing confidence in the chipmaker's future. The deal is seen as a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, though it does not currently include plans for Nvidia to use Intel's manufacturing facilities.</p>

          <p>Disney has indefinitely pulled ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" from the air following controversial comments the host made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel had accused conservatives of falsely linking the suspect to their movement, despite official reports indicating the suspect held left-wing views. The decision drew praise from figures like former MLB star Zack Cozart, who stated, "The tide is turning." The controversy also prompted a threat of action from the FCC and a decision by Nexstar Media Group to preempt the show on its affiliates.</p>

          <p>A public conflict has erupted between Zarah Sultana and Jeremy Corbyn, co-founders of a new left-wing party in the UK. Sultana accused the party's working group of being a "sexist boys' club" that has excluded her from key decisions and financial control. The dispute escalated after an email promoting party memberships was sent out, a move Sultana supported but Corbyn and other founders dismissed as "unauthorized." This internal turmoil raises serious questions about the new party's leadership structure and viability ahead of its founding conference.</p>

          <p>During its first-ever U.S. investor day, Hyundai Motor announced an increased revenue growth forecast for the year but lowered its 2025 operating profit margin expectations, citing ongoing U.S. tariffs. CEO José Muñoz highlighted the company's ambitious growth plans, including a $26 billion investment to expand American operations and produce over 80% of its U.S. vehicles locally by 2030. The event took place amid the fallout from a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia, an issue the CEO addressed with empathy.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, reported mixed quarterly financial results, with earnings per share falling short of Wall Street expectations while revenue remained in line. The company's stock declined over 9% following the news. Strong performance from its casual-dining brands, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, was driven by value-conscious consumers and helped offset a slight same-store sales decline in its fine-dining segment. Darden raised its full-year sales forecast but reiterated its previous earnings guidance, reflecting a cautious outlook.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of 2025, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. This article illustrates the tangible benefits for borrowers, calculating that the monthly payment on a $500,000 mortgage is now approximately $300 lower than it was at the beginning of the year. The rate reduction provides financial relief for new homebuyers struggling with affordability and creates valuable refinancing opportunities for current homeowners seeking to lower their costs.

          <p>Official figures show that the number of planning permissions granted for new homes in England has fallen to a record low, dealing a blow to the Labour government's goal of building 1.5 million homes. Fewer than 29,000 projects were approved in the year ending June 2025, the lowest since records began in 1979. The new housing secretary, Steve Reed, acknowledged the figures were "unacceptable" and pledged to overhaul the system, while the Conservative opposition criticized the government's planning reforms as ineffective.</p>

          <p>This article examines the scientific excitement and public curiosity surrounding Comet 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object ever detected in our solar system. While its unusual trajectory and a recent, sudden change in color have prompted a small number of researchers to speculate about an alien origin, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that its behavior is entirely consistent with that of a natural comet. The object presents a rare and valuable opportunity for astronomers to study material formed around another star, offering new insights into planetary system formation.</p>

          <p>Israeli author and psychotherapist Ayelet Gundar-Goshen believes that writing can be a powerful form of resistance, especially in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She argues that when political forces attempt to suppress narratives that humanize the other side, creating literature becomes a crucial act to face reality rather than escape it. Gundar-Goshen advocates for acknowledging the trauma experienced by both Israelis and Palestinians, using her work to explore the hidden psychological dynamics and blind spots that perpetuate the cycle of fear and violence.</p>

The central bank's accompanying forecast, or "dot plot," suggests two additional cuts may occur this year, followed by a more gradual easing in 2026 and 2027. Fed Chair Jerome Powell framed the decision as a "risk management" move rather than a response to a weakening economy, a characterization that left financial markets with a mixed and uncertain outlook on future policy.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has opted to keep its main interest rate unchanged at 4%, as Governor Andrew Bailey stated the country is "not out of the woods yet" regarding inflation. While the bank anticipates inflation will eventually fall to its 2% target, persistent price pressures, especially for food, have prompted a cautious stance on further cuts. Alongside the rate decision, the Bank announced it would slow the pace at which it sells its government bond holdings to minimize disruption to financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>
