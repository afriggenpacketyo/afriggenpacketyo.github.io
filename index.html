          <p>UK government officials were reportedly aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended him. Sources indicate that while Starmer himself was not briefed on the email contents, both No 10 and the Foreign Office had been alerted to them. The revelation has intensified pressure on Starmer's leadership and led to Mandelson's dismissal as the UK's ambassador to the US, with critics questioning the vetting process and the flow of information to the prime minister.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta infringed upon the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account. The court found that the company removed the account, which had over five million followers, without a clear justification and applied its nudity policies inconsistently compared to similar accounts. This ruling mandates that Meta must review its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions and more precisely define its rules on sexual content, highlighting a significant legal check on the power of social media platforms.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team faces a monumental challenge against England in the World Cup quarter-final, a rival they have not defeated in over 25 years. The article reflects on Scotland's last victory in 1999, contrasting the past era with the sport's current professional landscape. While England has consistently dominated recent matchups, Scotland has shown significant improvement, rising in world rankings. The match is set against a backdrop of uncertainty over Scottish players' contracts, yet there is a strong belief within the team that they can defy history and compete against the heavily favored English side.</p>

          <p>Experts are split on the winner of the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford's supporters point to his superior technical skill, adaptability, and ability to expose vulnerabilities in opponents, believing he can overcome the significant weight difference by out-boxing the aging champion. Conversely, those backing Álvarez argue that his size, power, and experience at the 168lb super-middleweight class will be insurmountable for Crawford, who is moving up two divisions. They contend that while Crawford is a master boxer, Canelo's strength and ability to control the ring will ultimately prove decisive.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has sworn in its first female prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The interim leader's appointment comes after intense negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives. President Ram Chandra Poudel has dissolved parliament and scheduled new elections for March 5. With a curfew eased and troops withdrawn, a sense of calm is returning to Kathmandu after the unrest, which was initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to simultaneously address China's declining birth rate and bolster its scientific workforce, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to support women under 40 who are returning to their scientific careers after childbirth. Initially covering 20 new mothers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to ease the transition back to work and retain valuable talent in the competitive research sector. This policy reflects a targeted approach to tackling two of the nation's major strategic priorities.</p>

Faye Hall, who was arrested with the couple, stated they are "literally dying" and that their physical and mental conditions are rapidly deteriorating in a maximum-security prison. The couple, who have lived in Afghanistan for years and hold Afghan citizenship, still do not know the reason for their detention.

While Moscow downplayed the incident, Warsaw insists the incursion was deliberate.

          <p>This article explores the potential implications of Cristiano Ronaldo returning to play in the United States after a 12-year absence, suggesting it could serve as a strategic endorsement for the 2026 World Cup under a second Trump presidency. The author connects Ronaldo's long absence to sexual assault allegations made against him in the US, which have since been dismissed, speculating that the changing political climate might now facilitate his return. The piece frames Ronaldo as a global icon whose presence would be a significant public relations victory for both FIFA and a Trump administration, legitimizing the US as a host nation amid concerns over political hostility.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recently released 2003 Jeffrey Epstein birthday album as a relic of a past culture where the sexual exploitation of young girls was widely normalized. The author, Rebecca Solnit, recounts examples from 1970s and 80s films, music, and media that depicted adult men with teenage girls as acceptable, framing this as a pre-feminist era. She argues that the feminist movement was crucial in challenging these norms by establishing principles of consent, exposing systemic abuse, and reframing power dynamics in sexual relationships, which has led to a significant, though incomplete, cultural shift.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Qatar targeting senior Hamas leaders appears to have backfired, with Hamas claiming its top officials survived the attack. The gamble by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was intended to pressure the group and advance his goal of "total victory," but it has instead strained relations with the US and enraged Qatar, a key mediator. The failed mission complicates ceasefire negotiations, potentially endangering the remaining hostages in Gaza. Despite the setback and international criticism, Netanyahu's hard-line coalition remains supportive, and he shows no signs of altering his war strategy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 5-1 to the San Francisco Giants after a walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning, halting a recent winning streak. Despite a brilliant performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who allowed only one run over seven innings, the Dodgers' offense struggled, scoring just a single run. The game was ultimately decided when closer Tanner Scott gave up the decisive home run to Patrick Bailey. This loss highlights the team's ongoing issues with offensive consistency and bullpen reliability, reigniting concerns as they head into the latter part of the season.</p>

          <p>The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is expected to perform strongly in upcoming local elections in Gelsenkirchen, a traditional stronghold of the center-left Social Democrats in western Germany. Capitalizing on local frustrations over issues like derelict housing and crime, the AfD's popularity has surged, with the party hoping to force a runoff in the mayoral race. This election is seen as a crucial test of public opinion for the new national coalition government. The potential success of the AfD has alarmed local community organizers, who fear that an increase in the party's power could lead to funding cuts for vital social and integration projects.</p>

In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the four nations proposed a nine-month transitional process aimed at establishing a civilian-led government. The conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which began in 2023, has led to a severe humanitarian crisis. The statement emphasizes that there is no military solution and that Sudan's future must be decided by its people through an inclusive process.</p>
