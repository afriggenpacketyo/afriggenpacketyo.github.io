          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing policy of allowing two free checked bags, joining other major U.S. airlines in charging baggage fees. This change comes after years of Southwest differentiating itself with this perk, but the increasing revenue from baggage fees across the industry has put pressure on the airline to adapt. Along with the baggage fee change, Southwest is also introducing basic economy tickets and modifying its open seating policy as part of a broader business model overhaul. Travelers should be aware of the new policies taking effect as they plan their future Southwest flights. </p>

          <p>Tech companies are increasing security measures at conferences due to heightened political tensions, employee protests, and concerns over AI development and security. Protests, often related to company contracts with the Israeli government, have disrupted events at Microsoft and Google, leading to increased security checks and even email monitoring. Security firms have noted a rise in requests for protection, especially from Fortune 500 companies, and companies are also responding by restricting internal discussions on sensitive topics. This article highlights the growing trend of tech companies prioritizing security amid a turbulent political climate, with some even employing undercover security personnel to monitor attendees. The increased security measures reflect a broader concern about safety and brand protection in an era of heightened social and political activism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author argues that summer is an overrated season, plagued by excessive heat, boredom, and the disappointment of unmet expectations. He challenges the idealized vision of summer as a time of leisure and freedom, pointing out the realities of work, high travel costs, and the lack of cultural events. The article suggests that summer suffers from a collective action problem, where everything slows down due to vacations and a lack of scheduled activities. Ultimately, the author advocates for lowering expectations and recognizing summer as just another three months of the year, advising readers to wear sunscreen.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at the age of 97. The film, released in 1969, challenged the myth of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation by interviewing citizens of Clermont-Ferrand who collaborated with or turned a blind eye to the Vichy regime. This article explains that despite initial controversy and a ban from French television, the documentary gained critical acclaim and paved the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls went on to direct other documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie."</p>

          <p>The head of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), Jake Wood, has resigned, citing the organization's inability to adhere to humanitarian principles of neutrality and independence. The GHF, backed by Israel and the US, aims to distribute aid in Gaza through private contractors, a plan criticized by the UN for potentially exacerbating displacement and using starvation as leverage. Despite Wood's resignation, the GHF plans to proceed with aid delivery, aiming to reach one million Palestinians, while Israel asserts the plan will reduce dependence on Hamas.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China and proposed budget cuts could impede the growth of the U.S. battery industry, which is crucial for meeting rising energy demands and supporting renewable energy sources. While the U.S. is beginning to produce batteries for energy storage, it relies heavily on Chinese components, making it vulnerable to trade policies. The article notes that proposed legislation could restrict access to subsidies for battery production and installation, creating uncertainty and potentially hindering investments. This situation highlights the tension between the administration's energy policies and the need for battery storage to support renewable energy integration (not investment advice).</p>

This article explains that Trump's comments come after Russia launched a major offensive, resulting in numerous civilian casualties, and as diplomatic efforts to secure a cease-fire appear to be faltering.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is employing a strategy called "legalistic noncompliance" to flout court orders while maintaining the appearance of compliance. This involves using specious legal arguments to justify actions that contradict judicial rulings, such as in cases related to the Alien Enemies Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The article argues that this approach lowers the public salience of noncompliance and could lead to legalized noncompliance, where courts issue rulings that allow the administration to circumvent their intent. While not as overt as outright defiance, legalistic noncompliance undermines the rule of law and weakens judicial oversight.</p>

          <p>Jake Wood, the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has resigned just hours before the program's launch, citing the impossibility of maintaining neutrality and independence. The GHF, tasked with distributing aid in Gaza, has faced criticism over its ties to Israel and concerns about its ability to operate independently. This article notes that Wood's resignation follows reports questioning the group's autonomy and its connections with Israeli officials and private contractors. Despite Wood's departure, the foundation plans to proceed with aid delivery, aiming to reach a million Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a series of drone strikes against Ukraine, resulting in casualties and infrastructure damage, as President Trump voiced criticism of both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump accused Putin of having "gone absolutely CRAZY" while also criticizing Zelenskyy for his comments regarding U.S. inaction against Russia. The head of a US-backed aid group in Gaza resigned, citing his inability to adhere to humanitarian principles. The article reports that Trump has announced a delay on tariffs on the European Union until July 9, following a conversation with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's delay of imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union, analysts warn that the potential for a trade war has not completely dissipated, and investors should prepare for continued volatility. The delay, prompted by a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, provides a six-week window for negotiations, but uncertainty remains regarding the U.S. President's specific demands. This article explains that experts suggest the EU is unlikely to capitulate to Trump's negotiating tactics, and the situation could lead to retaliatory measures from the EU if significant tariffs are levied (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>British businesses are reportedly rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to avoid unwanted political attention amid a right-wing backlash. Companies are reframing policies as "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture" and changing job titles to reflect these new priorities. This article notes that some US-headquartered firms are scaling back DEI commitments and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly. While a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act, the article suggests the shift is driven by concerns about legal risk and employee pressure to maintain inclusive policies.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, the United States possesses several unique traits that bolster its resilience. The article points to a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that resists rapid change, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a speech-protective legal tradition. These features, while potentially cumbersome in ordinary times, provide a strong defense against authoritarian overreach and ensure that the system remains easier to defend and worth defending.

          <p>This article discusses the need to rethink our relationship with the natural world in the face of climate change, advocating for a shift from viewing nature as inert to recognizing its inherent aliveness. It explores the concept of the Rights of Nature movement and how granting basic rights to natural entities like rivers can lead to a more sustainable relationship with the environment. The article draws on Robert Macfarlane's book, *Is a River Alive?*, to emphasize the importance of time, attention, and humility in understanding the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world.
