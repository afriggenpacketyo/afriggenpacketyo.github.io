          <p>A shooter opened fire during a morning Mass at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injuring 17 others, most of whom were children. The 23-year-old suspect, who had ties to the school through a parent's former employment, used multiple legally purchased firearms before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement is investigating the attack as a potential act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime, after the shooter posted videos online detailing plans for an attack on children. The tragic event, which occurred during the first week of school, has prompted calls for action from local and national leaders.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor risks in Seoul's housing market and rising household debt. Despite holding the rate, the central bank upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%, signaling modest economic improvement. The decision comes as the nation navigates its trade relationship with the U.S., which recently saw lowered tariffs on South Korean exports following significant investment pledges. Analysts suggest that with inflation near the target, the bank may consider a rate cut in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

The parade commemorates the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two and is expected to showcase China's latest military hardware. This visit represents a key geopolitical moment for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, positioning him as an influential figure with close ties to both Kim and Putin amid ongoing global tensions. The attendance raises questions about whether South Korea's president will also join, potentially creating the first meeting between the Korean leaders since 2019.</p>

The agency highlighted several cases involving nationals from Mexico, El Salvador, South Korea, Vietnam, and other countries, with prior convictions for serious crimes such as murder, sexual assault of a child, and carjacking. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated the operation targeted "criminal illegal aliens, gang members, child predators, and murderers" to enhance public safety. The announcement details the specific violent offenses committed by the arrested individuals, some of whom were registered sex offenders or had received lengthy prison sentences.</p>

          <p>The European Union is facing its most severe wildfire season on record, with over one million hectares burned so far this year. Spain and Portugal have been disproportionately affected, accounting for over two-thirds of the total area scorched across the bloc. Scientists from the World Weather Attribution group have directly linked the worsening fire conditions in the Mediterranean to climate change, which creates hotter and drier environments conducive to fires. The blazes have released record levels of carbon dioxide in Spain, exacerbating a vicious cycle of global warming, while also threatening protected ecosystems and highlighting the challenges of rural depopulation.</p>

          <p>A controversial immigration facility in the Florida Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have no detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The announcement follows a federal judge's order to wind down operations at the temporary center, which was the subject of multiple lawsuits. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams denied a request from the Trump administration and Florida officials to stay her order, rejecting their arguments that the facility was necessary due to overcrowding elsewhere. The state had constructed the facility in just eight days, and top officials had testified it was expected to cost approximately $400 million.</p>

          <p>To mark the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's murder, his family and supporters recreated the train journey he took from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955.

Among the passengers was Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., Till's cousin and the last living eyewitness to his kidnapping. Parker emphasized that the solemn ride was not to stir hatred but to remember the past and acknowledge how far the nation has come since the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Matt DeBoer, the principal of Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, praised the heroic actions of his staff and students following a deadly mass shooting at the school's church. He described how teachers immediately protected children and older students shielded younger ones when a gunman opened fire, calling the staff a "dream team" that prevented a worse tragedy. While calling the event a "nightmare" that claimed the lives of two students, DeBoer vowed that the community would recover and rebuild. He also made an impassioned plea for action to ensure such an event never happens again, urging people to both pray and "move your feet."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market value for pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks has dropped significantly, with the average price falling nearly 30% in the last year to just over $84,000. This decline is part of a wider trend affecting all used Tesla vehicles and comes as the company faces a substantial decrease in new car sales in 2025. Experts point to various factors, including public perception of CEO Elon Musk and the vehicle's high release price, which doubled initial estimates. The sharp depreciation has led some to question the long-term viability of the unconventional electric truck, with one report noting Tesla even stopped accepting Cybertrucks as trade-ins earlier this year.

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Despite the positive overall results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue of $41.1 billion fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The company's overall revenue grew 56% year-over-year to $46.74 billion, marking the ninth straight quarter of over 50% growth. Nvidia's finance chief stated the company anticipates AI infrastructure spending to reach between $3 and $4 trillion by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis piece describes a tense atmosphere in Washington D.C. following President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and a surge in federal law enforcement. While the visible military presence is presented as a crime-fighting measure, the article argues the more significant impact is from aggressive immigration raids conducted by agencies like ICE. Residents in multicultural neighborhoods report feeling more policed and fearful as federal agents detain individuals on their way to work, creating community-wide anxiety. The article frames these actions as an unprecedented extension of presidential authority over the city's local law enforcement, leading to visceral anger and a sense that the capital is creeping towards a tipping point.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that intense dust storms, known as haboobs, are becoming a growing threat in Southern and Central California due to climate change. Conditions such as prolonged drought, water overuse, and wildfires are creating drier landscapes, making them more susceptible to these massive walls of dust. These storms pose serious public health risks, as the airborne particles can carry toxic materials like pesticides and heavy metals, and are known to trigger asthma and other respiratory issues. Researchers estimate that over 5 million Californians are already directly affected by dust storms, a phenomenon that is difficult to forecast.</p>

The controversy was fueled by claims that the redesign was a sign of the company abandoning its traditional, rural American identity for a "woke" corporate aesthetic. This article argues that Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate simulation of authentic rural life, designed to capitalize on nostalgia. The brief and unpopular rebranding effort, much like the company's original concept, was simply another corporate attempt to appeal to a target demographic.</p>
