          <p>President Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles due to escalating immigration protests and clashes between federal agents and protesters, following ICE enforcement actions that led to over 100 arrests. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt cited violent attacks on ICE officers as the reason for federalizing part of California's National Guard, a move criticized by Governor Newsom as inflammatory and unnecessary. Defense Secretary Hegseth warned that active-duty Marines could be mobilized if violence continues, adding further tension to the situation. The deployment has sparked concerns about eroding public trust and escalating tensions between federal and local authorities. Optimism about the situation is low due to the potential for further conflict and the deepening divide between opposing viewpoints.</p>

Gaines addressed Biles' dig about losing to a trans swimmer, pointing out the biological differences between men and women and highlighting the contradiction of Biles' support for trans athletes given her history of speaking out against sexual abuse in gymnastics.

          <p>According to a report in the Washington Post, President Trump reportedly referred to Elon Musk as a "big-time drug addict" and disapproved of a physical altercation between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The report details escalating tensions between Trump and Musk, including disagreements over government spending and personnel appointments. Musk allegedly shoved Bessent after a meeting, leading Trump to deem the situation "too much." The relationship deteriorated further after Trump declined to nominate Musk's preferred candidate for NASA administrator, culminating in Musk's critical posts on X.</p>

The Women's History Museum of Zambia is working to revive this cultural heritage, nearly erased by colonialism, through social media and community research. The initiative also includes showcasing other artifacts, like leather cloaks, to emphasize the disruption of Zambian histories and the deliberate removal of women's roles.</p>

          <p>The feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has exacerbated uncertainty over NASA's budget, which faces deep cuts, leading to what some experts call the "biggest crisis ever" for the US space program.

The proposed budget cuts would affect numerous science missions and shift the agency's focus towards lunar and Martian exploration.

This follows a recent incident where a passenger was forced to unpack his belongings at the airport due to baggage exceeding the allowed size.</p>
