          <p>Torrential rains and flooding across five Mexican states have resulted in at least 64 deaths and left 65 people missing, impacting approximately 100,000 homes. The oil town of Poza Rica faces additional challenges from oil residue mixed with floodwaters, which authorities are investigating. President Claudia Sheinbaum affirmed sufficient resources for the emergency, with 10,000 troops deployed for rescue and aid delivery to cut-off communities. The deadly downpours are attributed to two dissipated tropical systems, Hurricane Pricilla and Tropical Storm Raymond, making advance warning difficult.</p>

          <p>China has imposed sanctions on five U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, accusing them of involvement in Washington's probe into the Chinese shipping industry. This move, which prohibits Chinese entities from doing business with the sanctioned companies, escalated tensions following new U.S. fees on Chinese ships and China's retaliatory charges on American vessels. Beijing also expanded its blacklist of U.S. companies and restricted rare earth exports, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to threaten increased tariffs. Hanwha Ocean's shares in Seoul plunged over 8% after the announcement, reflecting market concerns.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is advocating for an urgent, targeted prostate cancer screening program, asserting it would be affordable, deliverable, and save numerous lives. His call comes as the UK National Screening Committee re-evaluates its prior decision against routine screening. The proposed program, backed by Prostate Cancer Research, would focus on men aged 45-69 with a family history or Black men, who face double the risk, involving MRI scans, PSA tests, and biopsies. While proponents highlight its benefits and manageable costs, some medical experts remain skeptical, citing risks of unnecessary treatment and side effects, and potential strain on NHS scanning capacity.</p>

          <p>Peking University scientists have successfully restored the ancient Chinese calligraphic masterpiece, 'Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess' (Luoshen Fu), penned by Wang Xianzhi in the 4th century. Using artificial intelligence, the team replicated and expanded upon the original style and form based on 250 surviving characters. This endeavor resulted in a complete 919-character rendition presented in full scroll form. The university emphasized this achievement as a vivid illustration of how 'AI plus culture' can provide traditional calligraphic art with new modes of expression in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese chipmaker Wingtech plummeted 10% for a second consecutive session after the Dutch government took control of its Netherlands-based subsidiary, Nexperia.

This action underscores increasing global scrutiny over critical technology supply chains.

          <p>A bipartisan U.S. Congressional committee has launched an investigation into Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service over its alleged involvement in providing access to Myanmar scam centers. These centers are responsible for swindling billions from victims globally and are accused of operating with forced labor and human trafficking. Reports indicate a significant increase in Starlink dishes at these compounds following a supposed crackdown in February, making Starlink Myanmar's largest internet provider. Senator Maggie Hassan has urged Musk to block services to these fraud factories, emphasizing the abhorrent nature of an American company enabling such crimes.</p>

          <p>Four individuals have been arrested in connection with a mass shooting in Leland, Mississippi, that left six people dead and over a dozen injured during a homecoming weekend celebration. Teviyon L. Powell, William Bryant, and Morgan Lattimore face capital murder charges, while Latoya A. Powell is charged with attempted murder. The FBI stated the gunfire appears to have been 'sparked by a disagreement among several individuals,' with further arrests pending. This incident marks the 14th mass killing in 2025, according to a national database, highlighting a weekend of multiple shootings across Mississippi during homecoming events.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts, though slowing from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. Manufacturing and construction sectors saw softened growth, while services also slowed, primarily due to contractions in wholesale, retail trade, transportation, and storage. Despite the resilient pace, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) maintained its policy settings and projected a moderation in GDP growth for 2026 as trade-related sectors normalize. The central bank anticipates core inflation to ease in the near term before gradually rising, with global AI investment expected to support manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed legislation aimed at phasing out perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or 'forever chemicals,' from consumer products like nonstick cookware and children's items. Newsom expressed concern about the bill's impact on the availability of affordable cooking products, despite acknowledging efforts to protect consumer health. The legislation, which would have prohibited PFAS in cookware by 2030 and other products by 2028, faced opposition from industry groups who questioned the scientific basis for banning all PFAS and highlighted potential economic disruption. Proponents, including environmental and health coalitions, argued for protecting the state's water supply from contamination linked to these chemicals.</p>

          <p>China has announced the mass production of the world's first ultra-low noise, four-channel single-photon detector, dubbed the 'photon catcher.' This breakthrough technology, developed by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre, is capable of detecting individual photons, making it a core component for advanced applications. These applications range from daily communications to national defense, notably including quantum radar for tracking stealth aircraft like the F-22. The ability to detect a single photon is compared to distinguishing a single grain of sand falling during a thunderstorm, underscoring the device's unprecedented sensitivity and potential impact on military and technological capabilities.</p>
