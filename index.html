          <p>Jen Pawol made sports history by becoming the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game, officiating at first base during a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Her debut was celebrated by supporters, and she later donated her cap to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone. Pawol, a former all-conference softball player, has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016 and received widespread support from players and officials for her achievement. The 48-year-old is scheduled to umpire behind home plate later in the series.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a protest in Parliament Square organized in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. Demonstrators simultaneously revealed signs reading "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to mass arrests for supporting a banned organization. While the Home Secretary defended the proscription and police action, human rights groups like Amnesty International called the arrests disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression. The event marks one of the largest single-day arrest totals for the Met Police in the last decade.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order against former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke's political action committee, Powered by People. The order, sought by Attorney General Ken Paxton, prohibits the PAC from funding the travel and expenses of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. Paxton accused the group of bribery and deceptive fundraising, while O'Rourke countered with a lawsuit alleging the move is an attempt to silence political dissent and voter registration efforts. The legal battle unfolds as Texas Republicans aim to pass new congressional maps that could favor their party.</p>

          <p>A Texas real estate developer and trophy hunter, Asher Watkins, was killed by a Cape buffalo while on a hunting trip in South Africa. According to the safari company leading the expedition, the attack was "sudden and unprovoked" and occurred while Watkins was tracking the animal.

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long reportedly followed a disagreement with the Trump administration over a request for confidential taxpayer data. The Department of Homeland Security had asked the IRS to cross-reference a list of suspected undocumented immigrants against its records to find their addresses, as part of a broader immigration crackdown. The IRS declined to provide most of the information, citing taxpayer privacy laws, which allegedly led to Long's removal after just two months in the position. The White House has denied that a lack of alignment on the mission was the reason for the dismissal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Neurologists are cautioning against consuming certain foods that can harbor toxins and pathogens harmful to the nervous system, potentially leading to severe or long-term consequences. Experts specifically advise avoiding food from damaged or bulging cans due to the risk of botulism, a serious illness that can cause paralysis. They also recommend limiting the consumption of large tropical reef fish like barracuda, which can contain ciguatoxin, and avoiding under-cooked pork from unregulated sources to prevent neurocysticercosis, a leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. These risks are often overlooked because the symptoms can be slow to appear.</p>

          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Hindi-language film industry, Bollywood, has transformed significantly over the decades, reflecting the region's changing political landscape. Initially portrayed as a scenic, romantic paradise in post-independence films, the narrative shifted dramatically with the rise of armed insurgency in the late 1980s. Kashmir became a backdrop for stories of patriotism, conflict, and militancy. In recent years, and especially since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370, films have often aligned more closely with government narratives, sparking debate over one-sided portrayals versus more nuanced explorations of the region's trauma and complexity.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the NASA Crew-10 mission have safely splashed down in the Pacific Ocean aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, concluding a nearly five-month stay on the International Space Station. The crew, consisting of two US astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, conducted over 200 scientific experiments during their 146 days in orbit. Their mission was notable as they replaced the Crew-9 astronauts who had been stranded on the ISS for an extended period due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule. The successful return marks the completion of NASA's 10th commercial crew rotation mission.</p>

          <p>Germany's government has decided to halt arms exports to Israel that could be used in Gaza "until further notice," a move that has prompted fierce opposition from within the ruling coalition. Politicians from the conservative CDU/CSU alliance, a partner in the government, criticized the decision as a departure from Germany's long-standing foreign policy and its special responsibility toward Israel. However, the move has also received support from other conservatives and the center-left SPD party, who argue it is a necessary reaction to the recent decisions and actions of the Israeli government in the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through a homeowner's roof in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by a University of Georgia geologist and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old. This makes the space rock about 20 million years older than our own planet. The meteorite's arrival was preceded by a bright fireball seen across Georgia and South Carolina. Scientists believe the rock originated from the breakup of a much larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter about 470 million years ago. It is the 27th meteorite ever recovered in the state.</p>

The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was also found dead at the scene. Investigators are reportedly exploring the theory that the gunman was motivated by a belief that he had been harmed by the COVID-19 vaccine. The attack, which left bullet marks on several CDC buildings, has highlighted concerns about violence directed at public health institutions and the impact of intense politicization on public trust.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration protest drew hundreds of participants to the town of Nuneaton, England, for a march through the town center. The demonstration was one of several similar events held across the country. It was organized after the local council leader, from the Reform UK party, claimed that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers, a claim the BBC could not independently verify. Police reported that the event was mostly peaceful, though one teenager was arrested on suspicion of making threats, and a small group of counter-protesters was moved on by officers.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon has killed six Lebanese soldiers. The soldiers were inspecting the depot near the Israeli border as part of an effort to dismantle its contents, in accordance with a US-brokered ceasefire agreement with Israel. The incident occurs amid heightened tensions, as the Lebanese government has ordered the army to develop a plan to disarm Hezbollah, a move the powerful Iran-backed group has rejected. The disarmament is a key component of the ceasefire that ended months of cross-border fighting between Hezbollah and Israel.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is facing a severe environmental crisis due to a combination of plastic pollution, overfishing, sewage, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report drastically declining catches, with their nets often catching more plastic than fish, while industrial trawlers deplete fish stocks. In response, countries like Egypt are launching national plans for coastal restoration and plastic reduction, and international agreements like the High Seas Treaty aim to provide broader protections. However, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical, calling for more direct involvement and tangible action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A historical analysis of gerrymandering traces the current era of extreme partisan maps back to a 2010 Republican strategy called the "Redistricting Majority Project" (Redmap). The plan successfully targeted and flipped key state legislatures, allowing the GOP to control the redrawing of congressional and state-level districts after the 2010 census. This article explains how this led to durable Republican majorities in the House and in statehouses, even when Democratic candidates won more overall votes. While grassroots reform efforts saw some success, a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that deemed partisan gerrymandering a non-justiciable issue has re-opened the door for aggressive map-drawing.

Gloss's mother is Juliane Gallina, the CIA's deputy director for digital innovation. According to reports, Gloss had struggled with mental health issues and had expressed pro-Russian views on social media before enlisting with Russian forces, with the Kremlin initially unaware of his family background.</p>

          <p>Newly filed documents in the New Orleans Roman Catholic archdiocese's bankruptcy case reveal a point-based system for compensating survivors of clergy abuse. Under the proposed settlement, claims will be assigned points based on the severity of the abuse, with sexual assault receiving the highest value, and other factors like the long-term impact on the victim's life. Survivors will vote on the plan, which is valued between $180 million and $235 million, but some attorneys are urging a "no" vote, arguing their clients could receive more through individual lawsuits. The final monetary value of each point will only be known after all claims are assessed. (not investment advice)</p>
