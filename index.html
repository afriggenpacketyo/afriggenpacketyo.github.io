        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has confirmed discussions about the US government potentially acquiring a 10% stake in Intel to bolster the chip manufacturer's competitiveness against rivals like Nvidia and TSMC. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested swapping government grants for Intel shares, aiming to help Intel establish a manufacturing hub in Ohio. Some analysts express concerns that political involvement could impede decision-making and shift priorities, while others see the move as reflecting Intel's crucial role as a domestic high-end chip producer. Softbank's recent $2 billion stake purchase in Intel boosted the company's shares, indicating confidence in its turnaround. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Nebraska's Republican Governor Jim Pillen announced plans for a new immigration detention center in McCook, Nebraska, to aid President Trump's deportation efforts. The facility, dubbed the "Cornhusker Clink," will house individuals awaiting deportation and can accommodate up to 300 people. Pillen will deploy the Nebraska National Guard to provide administrative support, and the Nebraska State Patrol will assist federal immigration agents with arrests. The agreement, facilitated by congressional funding, has sparked concerns, with state Sen. Megan Hunt criticizing the lack of transparency. </p>

          <p>Texas Democrats are protesting new surveillance protocols and redistricting maps imposed by Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows. The protocols require Democrats to sign "permission slips" to leave the chamber, accompanied by a Department of Public Safety officer, to ensure their return. State Rep. Nicole Collier refused to comply, spending the night in the House chamber, while other Democrats tore up the slips in protest. The GOP plan aims to send five additional Republicans to the US House, while Democrats plan to challenge the maps in court.</p>

          <p>India and China are exploring ways to improve relations, including discussing border delimitation and boosting trade, even as mistrust persists between the two nations. India's Ministry of External Affairs announced the creation of an "expert group" to explore an "early harvest" approach to resolving boundary disputes. This represents a shift from India's previous stance against prioritizing settlement in less contentious areas. Experts suggest that mounting US tariff pressure is motivating India and China to demonstrate their ability to push back against Washington.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) reached a tentative agreement, ending a strike that grounded flights and stranded thousands of passengers. The agreement, which includes immediate pay increases for flight attendants, came after nine hours of talks with a government-appointed mediator. CUPE said the deal achieves "transformational change" for workers and the industry, advising its members to cooperate with the resumption of operations. While flights have begun resuming, Air Canada anticipates it may take days to restore full service.</p>

          <p>AI startups are being acquired by megacaps like Meta, Google, and Microsoft through high-priced talent grabs, leaving investors and remaining employees in limbo. These deals, which often produce big payouts for founders and AI leaders, can result in something resembling a zombie company, according to Samir Kumar of Touring Capital. Regulatory concerns have led companies to acquire talent and technology without taking a majority stake, circumventing premerger reviews. The trend threatens to thwart innovation as founders abandon ambitious projects to work for the biggest companies in the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed views on the Russia-Ukraine war that align with pro-Moscow talking points during an interview. He stated that the war started because of Crimea and NATO, echoing arguments that Ukraine existed as a "buffer" with the West. Trump criticized his predecessors for being weak, claiming Obama gave Crimea to Putin "without a shot fired." He also suggested that Ukrainian demands to return Crimea were "very insulting" to Russia, implying that Ukraine was the aggressor by refusing to cede land to Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump is working to coordinate a meeting between President Putin and President Zelenskyy, the first since Russia invaded Ukraine. Trump said he would let Putin and Zelenskyy meet first before getting involved himself, noting that they "haven't been exactly best friends." Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for the meeting. Trump stated he wants direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks to start by meeting one-on-one and will then meet with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders to "get it closed" if necessary.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu accused Australian Prime Minister Albanese of "betraying Israel" and "abandoning" Australia's Jewish community, escalating tensions between the two countries. This follows Australia barring a far-right Israeli politician from entering the country and Israel revoking visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority. Albanese's government recently announced it would recognize a Palestinian state, joining the UK, France, and Canada. Netanyahu launched a scathing attack on the leaders of the three countries, accusing them of siding with "mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers".</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed to have ended six or seven wars since starting his second term, highlighting his track record in peace negotiations. BBC Verify examined these conflicts and the extent to which Trump can take credit for ending them. The "wars" include conflicts between Israel and Iran, Pakistan and India, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Thailand and Cambodia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo. Some deals may not last, and the level of US involvement varies across these situations.</p>

          <p>A growing number of 20-somethings are getting "baby Botox" to prevent wrinkles by freezing facial muscles. The trend is driven by social media influencers and increased awareness of appearance due to online presence. Physicians have seen an uptick in young people seeking cosmetic injectables since the COVID-19 pandemic. While generally considered safe in small doses, Botox can cause muscle atrophy and a hollow facial appearance over time, leading to additional procedures and costs.</p>

Potential security guarantees range from policing Ukraine's airspace to providing training, intelligence, and weapons. The Kremlin has reiterated its opposition to any NATO troops in Ukraine, but Russia might accept a US security guarantee in return for formal recognition of the occupied territories.</p>
