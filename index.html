          <h2>Art Exhibit Canceled at Smithsonian Following Political Pressure Over Content</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An art exhibit by Amy Sherald, known for her portrait of Michelle Obama, has been canceled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. The cancellation followed pressure from Vice President JD Vance, who argued that a piece depicting a transgender Statue of Liberty was divisive and violated a Trump executive order against "woke indoctrination." Sherald stated she pulled the show after discussions about removing the work, refusing to comply with what she called a culture of censorship targeting vulnerable communities. The White House supported the cancellation, describing the painting as a reinterpretation of a sacred national symbol through a divisive lens.</p>

          <h2>Global Demand for Matcha Tea Leads to Supply Shortages and Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:41:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity for matcha, fueled by social media trends and a tourism boom in Japan, is causing significant supply shortages and driving up prices. Tea importers report that a month's supply is now selling out in days, with some cafes requesting a kilogram daily. The strain on supply is exacerbated by poor harvests due to heatwaves, an aging farmer population in Japan, and new U.S. tariffs. This situation has led retailers to limit purchases and has sparked a movement among advocates for more mindful consumption, urging people to appreciate high-grade matcha rather than using it in food products where its flavor is lost.</p>

          <h2>Sectarian Violence Escalates in Syrian City of Sweida, Resulting in Mass Casualties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 18:40:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Syrian city of Sweida, a Druze-majority area, has been devastated by a recent wave of sectarian violence, leaving over 1,300 people dead and displacing more than 120,000. The conflict, involving Bedouin clans, Druze militias, and government-aligned forces, has included summary executions and shelling, turning the city into a scene of carnage. A 70-year-old blacksmith recounted witnessing gunmen execute 13 of his family members. This violence underscores the challenges for Syria's interim government in uniting rival factions and has created a deep sense of foreboding among minority communities who fear Islamist extremism.</p>

          <p>Gaza is on the verge of a catastrophic famine, with its population severely weakened after more than a year of inadequate nutrition, according to Jeremy Konyndyk of Refugees International. The crisis has intensified since Israel imposed a near-total blockade in March, with aid now limited to a private, U.S.-backed foundation that provides insufficient and poor-quality supplies. Konyndyk explains that the population's exhausted coping mechanisms and weakened physical state mean a rapid increase in deaths from both starvation and preventable diseases is likely. Reversing a famine, once it starts, is extremely difficult and requires a massive, multi-faceted humanitarian response that is currently impossible.</p>

          <p>In central Nigeria's Plateau state, unidentified gunmen ambushed a vehicle, killing 14 people, including women and children, who were returning from a weekly market. The attack occurred in the Bokkos area, a region plagued by violent conflicts over limited land resources between farming and herding communities. Local community leaders and Red Cross officials confirmed the death toll and stated that the incident has heightened calls for increased security in the sparsely governed rural area. Following the ambush, two people were killed in an apparent revenge attack, further escalating tensions in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) artists are simultaneously holding spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for extended periods. This trend, described by experts as "faith-flavored music," is gaining mainstream traction, particularly through male artists blending country, conservative politics, and themes of masculinity. The success is partly driven by the massive media ecosystem of megachurches, which provides resources for smaller churches to replicate their high-production worship experiences. This boom reflects a broader cultural moment where a segment of evangelicals feels their values are gaining prominence in popular culture and politics.</p>

Analysts are also watching how the company will manage its traditional broadcast and cable TV assets, which face declining viewership, and whether creative freedom at shows like 'South Park' will be maintained under the new ownership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision and will release $5.5 billion in congressionally approved education funds to states. The funds, intended for the 2025-26 school year to support programs like educator training and arts education, were abruptly frozen in July. The White House's Office of Management and Budget had claimed the funds were being misused for a "radical left-wing agenda."

          <p>Two senior officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Jeff Dillen and Stephen Volz, have been placed on administrative leave. Both men led the 2020 investigation into "Sharpiegate," which found that top agency officials had violated scientific integrity by altering a hurricane forecast to align with President Trump's incorrect statements. The timing of their removal has fueled speculation of retaliation, as it comes just before the confirmation hearing for Neil Jacobs, the former NOAA chief implicated in the scandal, to lead the agency again. NOAA has become almost unrecognizable under the current administration, facing budget cuts and policies that erode its scientific mission.</p>

President Trump stated that "Hamas didn’t really want to make a deal," while Hamas expressed surprise at the withdrawal of U.S. negotiators. The breakdown in talks comes as Gaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis, with the World Food Program reporting that one-third of the population has gone multiple days without eating. The situation highlights the dire circumstances on the ground as diplomatic efforts to secure a permanent end to the conflict and increase aid have once again failed.</p>

The card, which features Clark's signature and a patch from her game-worn uniform, reflects the immense popularity she has brought to the WNBA. Clark, who was the first overall pick in the 2024 draft, has had a massive following since her record-breaking college career. This sale marks the 14th Clark-related card to be auctioned for a sum that significantly exceeds her estimated $80,000 seasonal salary, highlighting her massive market appeal.</p>

The payments, which can range from a few thousand to over £100,000, have already been claimed by about 16,000 individuals.

          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have expressed bewilderment over the Justice Department's direct handling of interviews with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, calling the process unorthodox and concerning. They noted that it is highly unusual for the Deputy Attorney General, Todd Blanche, to personally conduct such an interview rather than the line prosecutors who handled the case. Experts raised concerns about Blanche's ability to assess Maxwell's credibility without intimate knowledge of the case facts. They suggest the meeting appears to be a political move to address public pressure regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files, rather than a standard investigative procedure.</p>

The walkout, organized by the Local 26 union against employer Aramark, began after more than a year of failed contract negotiations. A major point of contention is the installation of AI-powered self-service kiosks, which workers fear will eliminate their jobs and diminish the fan experience. The union is asking fans not to buy concessions during the Red Sox-Dodgers series and has received public support from Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump on homelessness has sparked both outrage and cautious hope among local officials and advocates. The order's harsh preamble links homelessness to drug addiction and violence, and it calls for enforcing bans on urban camping while promoting civil commitment for individuals with mental illness. However, the order also directs federal agencies to make funds available for encampment removal, which some see as a potential lifeline for programs like Los Angeles's Inside Safe. Critics are concerned the order promotes criminalization and undermines proven strategies like "housing first," while others see it reflecting ongoing policy shifts.</p>
