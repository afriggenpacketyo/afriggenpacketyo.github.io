          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces scrutiny for sharing sensitive war plans on the Signal app with his wife, brother, and lawyer, prompting calls for his removal.

          <p>Pope Francis, who passed away at the age of 88 from a stroke leading to heart failure, detailed his wishes for his burial in his last will and testament dated June 29, 2022.

He requested a simple tomb in the earth with only his name inscribed, and offered his suffering for world peace and brotherhood. Francis served as the leader of the Catholic Church since 2013 and was the first pontiff from Latin America.</p>

          <p>A minke whale died from domoic acid poisoning linked to a toxic algal bloom affecting marine life in Southern California. Test results confirmed high levels of domoic acid in the whale's urine, consistent with other marine mammals affected by the bloom. Hundreds of sea lions and dolphins have also been impacted by the neurotoxin, which accumulates in fish consumed by these animals. Experts attribute the bloom to an upwelling of nutrients, climate change, and runoff from recent fires, marking the fourth consecutive year of domoic acid events.</p>

          <p>Canada's federal election agenda is now dominated by concerns over the US, while climate change has taken a back seat. Mark Carney's Liberals aim to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy, whereas the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to boost the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. Public concerns over climate have fallen as worries over rising prices, energy, and housing costs have increased. Canada's relationship with the US and the impact of potential energy tariffs are also key considerations.</p>

          <p>Approximately 5 million Americans with defaulted student loan payments will have their loans sent for collections, marking the first time collections have resumed since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education's announcement coincides with terminations of Federal Student Aid (FSA) employees, raising concerns about borrower support. The Department emphasized protecting taxpayers from federal student loans that borrowers "willingly" undertook. The collections process typically involves wage garnishments and offsetting tax refunds, which can negatively impact credit scores and future student aid eligibility.</p>

          <p>The Trump Administration will resume collections on defaulted student loans, ending a five-year hiatus. The Department of Education will begin notifying borrowers in default and urging them to make payments or enroll in a repayment plan. The department will then refer borrowers to a collections program run by the Treasury Department. This move has been criticized as poorly timed, given the economic uncertainty many Americans are facing.
