          <p>An SUV crash in Herriman, Utah, led to a dramatic explosion that destroyed a Domino's Pizza restaurant. The vehicle ruptured a natural gas line after crashing into the building, causing the blast moments after two bystanders heroically rescued the occupants from the SUV. Fortunately, no one was inside the business at the time of the incident, and no firefighters were injured by the subsequent explosion. Multiple people involved in the initial three-vehicle accident were hospitalized, but the explosion itself caused no additional injuries.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in California, the state's largest wildfire so far this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Favorable weather and an increase in personnel have helped crews reach 30% containment, a substantial improvement from the previous day. The fire, which started near New Cayuma, has forced evacuations and threatens structures as well as the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to several endangered species. Officials are hopeful for continued progress before a potential heat wave arrives midweek.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo in response to the team's prolonged struggles and poor performance. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. In a statement, principal owner Mark Lerner acknowledged their past success, including a 2019 World Series title, but stated that a "fresh approach and new energy" were necessary. The team's ongoing offensive woes and failure to make the postseason for five consecutive years prompted the major organizational change.</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have resumed in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli airstrikes continue in the Gaza Strip. The talks focus on a U.S.-backed proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release for an increase in humanitarian aid. However, the negotiations are challenged by ongoing violence, with recent strikes killing dozens of Palestinians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that any deal must lead to the complete elimination of Hamas's military and governmental capabilities, a key point of contention.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in three Yemeni ports, including Hudaydah, Ras Isa, and Saif. The attacks, part of what Israel calls "Operation Black Flag," were a direct response to the Iran-backed group's repeated missile attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Israeli officials stated the targeted ports were being used by the Iranian regime to transfer weapons for terrorist activities. This action represents a significant escalation in the regional conflict that has expanded alongside the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>This article provides a look into the rigorous training of the U.S. Coast Guard's surfmen, an elite group certified to conduct rescue missions in the most extreme sea conditions. Their training ground is the notoriously dangerous mouth of the Columbia River, known as the "Graveyard of the Pacific," where powerful river currents collide with ocean waves. To become one of the few hundred certified surfmen, candidates must prove they can operate a 47-foot lifeboat in 20-foot breaking waves and 50-knot winds, a testament to their skill and bravery.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly flash floods in central Texas, a dispute has arisen between some state officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) over the adequacy of the storm forecasts. Texas officials argued that while warnings were issued, they failed to convey the unprecedented nature of the flood, which arrived as a nearly 30-foot wall of water. The NWS defended its actions, pointing to a series of escalating alerts, including a rare "flash flood emergency," that were sent to the affected areas hours before the worst of the flooding occurred.</p>

Despite the high-quality certification, the business ultimately failed due to a combination of factors, including limited availability, high prices, and poor customer reviews that criticized the steaks for being bland and having a grainy texture, failing to justify their premium cost.</p>
