          <h2>Volkswagen Lowers Financial Outlook Amid Decreased Profits and US Tariff Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:37:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has significantly reduced its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit. The company attributed the decline to the impact of U.S. import tariffs, increased competition, and higher sales of lower-margin electric vehicles. Volkswagen's chief financial officer noted the challenging environment, which also includes restructuring costs. The automotive sector is particularly vulnerable to these tariffs due to highly globalized supply chains, with the company now forecasting a lower operating return on sales.

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are confronting a severe outbreak of the New World screwworm, a parasite whose larvae consume the flesh of living animals. The infestation has prompted the United States to bar Mexican cattle imports, creating significant economic pressure. Veterinarians and ranchers in the state of Chiapas report being overwhelmed, with the cost of medicine soaring and a new U.S.-supported sterile fly production facility not expected to be operational until next year. The crisis affects not only cattle but also other livestock and pets, with many feeling they are facing the problem alone.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump visits his Scottish golf properties, U.K. officials are seeking to resolve outstanding issues in the recent U.S.-U.K. trade agreement. Key discussion points for his meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer include the removal of a 25% U.S. tariff on British steel and aluminum and disagreements over a U.K. digital services tax. While the broader trade deal is in place, these unresolved commitments are crucial for cementing the economic partnership. Analysts suggest a potential compromise could see the U.K. drop its digital tax in exchange for the U.S. lifting the metal tariffs.</p>

          <p>Two men from the Dominican Republic, identified as being in the U.S. illegally, have been federally charged following the shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Protection officer in Manhattan. One suspect faces a charge for possessing ammunition as an illegal alien, while the other is charged as an accessory after the fact. According to authorities, both men have prior criminal records and were subject to removal orders. The incident has intensified the debate over sanctuary city policies, with officials highlighting that one of the suspects had been previously released by New York City authorities despite an active ICE detainer.</p>

          <p>In a U.K. first, the Welsh government will provide individuals with coeliac disease and other gluten-related conditions with pre-loaded debit cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current pharmacy prescription model, aiming to "de-medicalise" the process and give people more choice and convenience. A pilot program participant found the card helpful, though noted the monthly allowance only partially covers the higher cost of gluten-free products. The government anticipates the scheme will be cost-neutral for the NHS and reduce administrative burdens.</p>

Riley acknowledged last season's struggles in closing out games but expressed confidence in the team's progress, particularly on defense, which he says has significantly improved in depth and talent.

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly increased the U.S. military's role at the southern border, tripling troop deployment to 7,600 and establishing militarized zones where soldiers can apprehend migrants. A new command center in Arizona now oversees patrols using armored vehicles, helicopters, and drones to deter illegal crossings. This shift circumvents the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically prohibits military involvement in domestic law enforcement.

          <p>As President Trump travels to Scotland for a visit to his golf resorts, he faces the challenge of escaping the political turmoil in Washington, particularly the controversy surrounding his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. The trip, which includes a massive security operation and planned protests, is seen by some as an attempt to shift focus. However, persistent media inquiries and revelations about the Epstein case risk overshadowing his diplomatic and business agenda. The article suggests that despite the change of scenery, the president's political baggage will likely remain a central part of the narrative during his visit.</p>

          <p>A rescue operation is in progress in northern British Columbia, Canada, to free three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse at the Red Chris copper and gold mine. The workers are located behind a large debris pile and are sheltering in a refuge chamber designed to support multiple people with sufficient air, food, and water. Communication with the trio was lost after a second cave-in, complicating efforts. The mine operator, Newmont, has suspended production and is using specialized drones and remote-controlled equipment to assess the situation and determine the safest way to clear the blockage.</p>

          <p>Three former Department of Justice officials, including a prosecutor who handled January 6 cases and the department's top ethics official, have filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi challenging their recent firings. The lawsuit argues their terminations were arbitrary and did not follow proper civil service procedures, as they were given one-page memos citing presidential power without specific cause. They are seeking immediate reinstatement and back pay. The firings are part of a larger wave of dismissals at the DOJ that have included staff linked to the Capitol riot investigation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, the scientists discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker layers slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale devices.</p>

          <p>A CIA spokesperson has stated that Director John Ratcliffe "strongly supports" the recent public release of a sensitive 2017 House Intelligence Committee report on Russian election interference by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The declassification was reportedly initiated by Ratcliffe to bring "transparency to the American people." The documents have been used by Gabbard to allege an Obama-era conspiracy to undermine President Trump.

          <p>Princeton, Texas, a small city north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the U.S. by the Census Bureau, with its population surging from 17,000 to 37,000 in just three years. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for significantly less than the county median. This explosive growth has created significant infrastructure challenges, forcing the city to temporarily halt new construction to catch up on sewer, water, and road development. With another 13,000 homes already approved, the city is racing to manage its expansion as it projects a future population of 100,000 people.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, Justice Maria Carroccia stated she did not find the complainant's evidence to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The trial's central issue was whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player before others entered the room, had consented to subsequent acts. The players, who were all in the NHL system, remain ineligible to play pending a league review of the verdict.</p>

The proposal has sparked concern among dozens of branches and volunteers, who fear the changes will lead to an exodus of volunteers, create impersonal call centers, and undermine the supportive, community-based model that has been in place for 70 years.</p>
