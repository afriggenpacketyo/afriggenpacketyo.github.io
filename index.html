          <p>An active shooter incident at the Fort Stewart army base in Georgia resulted in five soldiers being shot and wounded. Officials confirmed that the injured soldiers received immediate medical treatment on-site before being transported to an Army hospital for further care. The base was placed on lockdown, but the situation was quickly contained, with a suspect taken into custody shortly after the event began. The White House and Georgia's governor were briefed on the situation, and the FBI is coordinating with the Army's Criminal Investigation Division on the ongoing investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, has publicly criticized Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani for allegedly changing his stance on policing. Adams accused Mamdani of being insincere, suggesting his newfound pro-public safety rhetoric is a political maneuver for the election, contrasting it with Mamdani's past calls to defund the NYPD. Mamdani has recently argued for a new Department of Community Safety to handle mental health calls, aiming to free up police to focus on serious crime. However, past social media posts show him strongly advocating for dismantling the police department, creating a stark contrast with his current campaign position.</p>

          <p>A group of Texas Democratic lawmakers, who had fled to Illinois to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, were evacuated from their hotel due to a bomb threat. The legislators stated they would not be intimidated by such actions, which they linked to heated rhetoric from Republican state leaders. This incident escalates an already intense political showdown where Democrats are trying to prevent the passage of a new congressional map that heavily favors Republicans. In response to their absence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has taken legal action to have the lawmakers' seats declared vacant, though legal experts consider the move a long shot.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a significant 20% surge after the e-commerce giant reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue. The company issued an optimistic forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth at a rate higher than Wall Street had anticipated. This strong performance and positive guidance indicate that Shopify is successfully navigating broader economic uncertainties, with its CFO stating that the anticipated negative impact from US tariffs "did not materialize." The growth was further evidenced by a 29% year-over-year increase in gross merchandise sales, reflecting continued strong consumer activity on the platform.</p>

          <p>In their opening match of The Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave secured a decisive six-wicket victory over the Manchester Originals. The win was spearheaded by an impressive bowling performance from England's Lauren Bell, who took three wickets for 28 runs. The Originals' batting lineup struggled, managing to post only 95 runs, with Seren Smale being the lone standout performer with an undefeated 40. In response, Southern Brave, anchored by South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt's 42 not out, comfortably chased the target with 11 balls remaining, signaling a strong start to their season.</p>

          <h2>Comparing the Suitability of Annuities and CDs for Retirement Planning</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the roles of certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities in retirement planning, concluding that neither is universally superior but each serves different needs. CDs offer simplicity, predictability, and FDIC-insured safety, making them ideal for short-term goals and preserving capital without risk. However, their returns often fail to outpace inflation, and they do not provide guaranteed lifetime income. Annuities are specifically designed to address longevity risk by converting a lump sum into a guaranteed income stream for life, though they are more complex, less liquid, and can have higher fees. The best choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and need for lifetime income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite its military capabilities being severely weakened after nearly two years of war, Hamas continues to operate a covert cash-based system to pay its civil servants in Gaza. The organization is reportedly distributing around $7 million every ten weeks to approximately 30,000 employees, though these payments represent only a fraction of their pre-war salaries. This system persists amid a destroyed banking infrastructure, soaring inflation, and severe food shortages, causing resentment among recipients. The funds are allegedly sourced from a large cash reserve stockpiled in tunnels before the conflict began, highlighting Hamas's lingering administrative influence even under intense military pressure.</p>

          <p>Apple announced it will increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion, a move made amid ongoing pressure from the Trump administration to onshore more of its manufacturing. The commitment, which includes a new "American Manufacturing Program," brings Apple's total planned US investment to $600 billion over four years. This development comes as President Trump continues to push for American production of Apple products like the iPhone, which are largely assembled in China. The announcement may help Apple navigate the administration's aggressive tariff policies, which have recently been expanded to include higher rates on goods from India, where Apple has been shifting some production.</p>

          <p>A new case before the Supreme Court, NetChoice v.

Existing precedent from Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011) strongly protects minors' access to speech, but the court's willingness to contract these rights in the pornography case suggests a potential shift.

          <p>A report from the office of Senator Jon Ossoff has documented over 500 credible allegations of human rights abuses in U.S. immigration detention centers since January 2025. The findings include reports of deaths in custody, physical and sexual abuse, and the mistreatment of pregnant women and children. Specific cases cited involve a woman left to miscarry alone and a child recovering from brain surgery being denied medical care. The senator's office accused the Department of Homeland Security of obstructing congressional oversight by limiting access to facilities, while DHS has denied the claims, stating that all detainees receive proper care.</p>

          <p>The leader of the largest railroad labor union in the United States is raising alarms about the proposed merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, warning it could lead to transportation "meltdowns" and significant job losses. Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD, stated the union will petition the government to block the deal, citing concerns over safety and the exclusion of labor from initial planning. The union fears that creating the nation's first coast-to-coast freight rail operator without worker input will repeat the chaotic failures of past rail mergers. The deal now awaits a decision from the Surface Transportation Board, with potential influence from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced an additional 25% tariff on goods imported from India, raising the total tariff rate to 50%. This punitive measure is a direct response to India's continued purchase of oil from Russia, which the Trump administration claims is "fueling the war machine" against Ukraine. The move also reflects criticism of India's participation in the BRICS trading bloc, which President Trump has described as an anti-US coalition. India's government has condemned the action as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," stating its energy imports are based on market factors and national security needs for its 1.4 billion citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that trees harbor a rich and complex microbiome within their trunks, similar to the microbial communities found in the human body. Researchers found that an average tree contains approximately one trillion microbe cells, including distinct communities of fungi, bacteria, and viruses specialized for different parts of the wood. This discovery redefines trees as complex ecosystems rather than standalone organisms and suggests these internal microbes could play a crucial role in tree health, growth, and defense. The findings open new frontiers for forest science and understanding how forests might respond to challenges like climate change.</p>

          <p>US rapper Soulja Boy, legally named DeAndre Cortez Way, has been released from custody after prosecutors declined to file weapons charges against him due to insufficient evidence. He was arrested after a firearm was discovered in a vehicle he was in during a traffic stop and spent two nights in jail. The artist, best known for his 2008 Grammy-nominated hit "Crank That," has had previous legal issues, including a prior conviction for carrying a loaded firearm. This recent release resolves his immediate legal jeopardy, though he separately faced a multi-million dollar civil judgment for sexual battery earlier in the year.</p>

In a letter to the agencies, Warren argued the deal could harm consumers and smaller businesses by raising prices, cutting jobs, and reducing competition in the athletic footwear market. She warned that the acquisition could create a duopoly with rival JD Sports, giving the combined entity immense power over suppliers and potentially squeezing out independent retailers.

This ruling complicates the German government's plans to expand its list of safe countries, which currently includes nations like Georgia and Moldova.

In its filing, the CEO cited intense online competition from rivals like Shein and a general shift away from brick-and-mortar retail as key factors in its decline.

          <p>The relationship between the U.S. and India has soured dramatically, culminating in President Trump imposing a total 50% tariff on Indian goods as a penalty for Delhi's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. This move marks a sharp reversal from the previously strong ties between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump's recent rhetoric has been harsh, calling India's economy "dead" and criticizing its role in the BRICS group. Delhi has called the tariffs "unjustified" and is facing domestic pressure to respond firmly, creating a difficult diplomatic situation for a government that still hopes to secure a broader trade deal with the U.S.</p>
