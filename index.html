          <p>In a groundbreaking legal move, the sister of Christopher Pelkey, who was killed in a 2021 road rage incident, used an AI-generated likeness of her brother to deliver a victim impact statement during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas. The AI avatar conveyed a message of forgiveness, which the judge praised. This unprecedented use of AI has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about potential manipulation and deception in legal proceedings. While some legal experts found no ethical or legal issues, others cautioned against the use of AI in court, citing the risk of inflaming emotions and the potential for altered content.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision, the Trump administration is set to immediately remove transgender troops from the military, identifying individuals through medical records indicating gender dysphoria or related treatments. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted about the decision, signaling a shift away from inclusivity. The policy affects up to 1,000 openly transgender service members and gives those not yet identified 30 days to remove themselves. Meanwhile, Britain has become the first country to strike a trade agreement with the Trump administration since the announcement of global tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a new trade pact with the UK, but details remain limited and analysts suggest the benefits are narrow.

In exchange, the US anticipates expanded sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK. While officials from both countries hailed the agreement as a breakthrough, some analysts noted that the changes were marginal and that the deal primarily serves as a political victory for Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the upcoming fiscal package, a move that would create a new top income bracket for those earning over $2.5 million per year and tax income above that level at 39.6%. This proposal, which would roll back a key element of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is intended to offset spending cuts to Medicaid. While alarming many Republicans, the tax hike may help protect Medicaid and garner working-class support.</p>

          <p>India appears ready to strike a trade deal with the U.S., proposing zero tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals on a reciprocal basis. This shift marks a departure from India's protectionist stance, driven by President Trump's tariffs on Indian exports. While the deal could boost U.S. exports to India, experts suggest it may not significantly harm domestic industries. Potential winners in India include financials, materials, and healthcare, while logistics companies and consumer staples could also benefit.</p>

The defense successfully argued for a jury from outside Memphis and deflected blame onto other officers involved. The verdict, reached despite video evidence of the beating, has sparked outrage and raised questions about accountability for police misconduct. The three officers were found guilty of witness tampering in a separate federal trial, and one was found guilty on a lesser charge of violating Mr. Nicholsâ€™s civil rights by causing bodily injury.</p>
