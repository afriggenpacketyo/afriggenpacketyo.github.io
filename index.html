His former bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, expressed deep devastation, highlighting his essential and irreplaceable role during the band's formative foundational chapters and its enduring legacy. Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973, contributing to many classic albums and becoming known for his "Spaceman" persona and intense stage shows featuring pyrotechnics.

          <p>China's vast property market is projected to continue its decline at least until 2026, according to Edward Chan, a director at S&P Global Ratings. He forecasts nationwide primary property sales will fall by 8% in 2025 and an additional 6-7% in 2026, attributing this to persistently soft overall demand. This ongoing downturn will intensify pressure on numerous Chinese developers who are already struggling to deliver homes while simultaneously managing their substantial debt obligations. One major developer, Cifi, is reportedly canceling existing debts and issuing new bonds to strengthen its capital structure and reduce offshore obligations by approximately $1.4 billion.

          <p>Fox News' "Antisemitism Exposed" newsletter details the harrowing experiences of the last 20 Israeli hostages released from Gaza, revealing accounts of starvation, isolation, and torture during captivity. The article also highlights a controversy involving the nation’s largest teachers' union, which sent a mass email containing a map erasing Israel and materials supporting Hamas's October 7 attacks. Additionally, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg faced backlash for using an image of an emaciated Israeli hostage in a post allegedly showing Palestinian suffering. This article underscores escalating antisemitism and its deep and lasting effects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's highly unusual public admission of authorizing CIA covert operations in Venezuela grants the agency broad leeway for potential actions, potentially including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or broader efforts to destabilize the Nicolás Maduro regime. This "presidential finding" does not require congressional approval and could take various forms, from targeted killings to influence operations, or supporting armed rebel movements. Experts, including former CIA officers, warn of a "slippery slope" given the US's long and often problematic history of interventions in Latin America, raising questions about the scope and implications of these clandestine activities.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former national security advisor to President Trump, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 18 counts, including transmitting and retaining national defense information. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, asserted that the charges stem from unclassified diary entries shared only with his immediate family and known to the FBI since 2021. Bolton himself claims this indictment is the latest target in Trump's retribution and weaponization of the Justice Department against his critics, making him the third high-profile Trump foe recently charged alongside James Comey and Letitia James. He vows to fight the charges and expose alleged abuses of power.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, who commands US military forces in Latin America, will abruptly retire at year's end, less than a year into his typical three-year posting as head of US Southern Command. His departure comes amid escalating tensions with Venezuela and US military strikes on suspected drug smugglers in the Caribbean, with reports suggesting tension between Holsey and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the mission. The New York Times reported an unnamed official said Holsey "had raised concerns about the mission and the attacks on the alleged drug boats." Senator Jack Reed expressed alarm over this "instability within the chain of command," cautioning against any military intervention in Venezuela without proper congressional authorization.</p>

Recent bankruptcies in the auto industry and disclosed bank losses on commercial loans are seen as early warning signs.

          <p>The UK Prime Minister criticized the decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending their Europa League match against Aston Villa due to safety concerns, calling it the "wrong decision." The Safety Advisory Group, citing current intelligence and past incidents of "violent clashes and hate crime offenses," prohibited away fans from the Birmingham match. Other prominent political leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, condemned the move as sending a "horrendous and shameful message" about antisemitism and preventing Jewish fans from safely enjoying games. Israel's Foreign Minister also urged a reversal of the decision.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted Cameron Arnold and Zachary Evetts, alleging they were part of a "North Texas Antifa cell" that orchestrated a violent July 4 attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center. The men face serious charges, including providing material support to terrorists and attempted murder of officers. Authorities claim the heavily armed group, which coordinated via encrypted apps, extensively pre-planned to target law enforcement officers. Defense attorneys, however, argue that anti-government beliefs are not criminal and downplayed their clients' direct involvement in the gunfire that injured an officer.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, a pioneering figure and "founding mother" of NPR, has died at the age of 87, leaving a profound legacy in broadcast journalism. Joining NPR at its inception, she broke barriers as one of the first women to host a national news program, including "All Things Considered" and "Weekend Edition," at a time when commercial networks rarely hired women for such roles. Colleagues remember her as a yenta, a mentor, and a storyteller who was always tough, true to herself, and found joy in the creativity of culture, the spark of science, and even the humanity in politics. Her enduring influence is symbolized by her recorded voice still announcing floors at NPR's headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has continued to block President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, ruling that the facts do not justify his actions under federal law, specifically Title 10. The three-judge panel found "insufficient evidence" of a rebellion or danger of one, or that federal forces were unable to execute laws, despite protests at an ICE facility. While the Guard troops remain under federal control, the decision prevents their active deployment within Illinois, upholding a challenge from the state and city of Chicago and emphasizing checks on executive power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced efforts to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), urging US employers to offer new, separate fertility benefit options for employees. President Trump also secured a deal with EMD Serono, the world's largest fertility drug manufacturer, to significantly lower the cost of some of its IVF therapies, which will be available on TrumpRx.gov. These moves aim to make it easier and more affordable for couples to have children, following public outrage over an Alabama court ruling on embryos and addressing the high cost and limited insurance coverage of IVF procedures.</p>

The issue gained prominence after China's ambassador linked lifting canola duties to Canada removing EV tariffs, highlighting the delicate economic and trade considerations involved for Canada as it walks a fine line between two global powers.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity company F5's stock dropped 10% after disclosing a system breach where a "highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor," later attributed to state-backed Chinese hackers, gained long-term access to its BIG-IP product development environment. The breach compromised source code and information on undisclosed vulnerabilities, with hackers reportedly in the network for at least 12 months using malware called Brickstorm. F5 stated no evidence of new unauthorized activity or active exploitation has been found since the August discovery.

          <p>Americans are experiencing a significant surge in unsolicited robocalls and robotexts, reaching an average of 2.56 billion calls monthly and 19 billion texts annually in 2025, according to a U.S. PIRG Education Fund report. Despite safeguards like the TRACED Act, scammers are employing more sophisticated tactics, including AI voice-cloning tools, to defraud victims, who lost an average of $3,690 per scam call. The report highlights slow compliance with mandated anti-robocall software implementation among phone companies, with less than half fully installed, contributing to the problem's escalation and leaving consumers vulnerable.</p>
