          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed the situation in Ukraine, ceasefire proposals, and relations with the United States in a recent interview. Lavrov stated that Russia only targets military goals and civilian sites used by the military, disputing claims of intentional attacks on civilian areas. He mentioned President Putin's support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal by President Trump, contingent on guarantees that Ukraine would not use the ceasefire to strengthen its military. Lavrov also touched on the complexities of negotiations with the US, emphasizing that serious proposals are being considered but cannot be disclosed publicly until an agreement is reached.

          <p>President Trump's meeting with President Zelensky has offered a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians amidst ongoing conflict with Russia. Trump questioned why Putin would continue attacks while the US is attempting to broker peace, suggesting a potential shift in approach. This comes as the US has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that many Ukrainians view as unfavorable, but Trump's recent statements suggest he may not force Ukraine into a lopsided agreement. The meeting followed a large Russian missile attack on Kyiv, prompting Trump to publicly urge Putin to stop. Optimism score: 55</p>
