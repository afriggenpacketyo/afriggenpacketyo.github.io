          <p>The UK government has decided to delay changes to cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), forgoing an expected reduction of the £20,000 tax-free allowance for now. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was anticipated to announce the move to encourage more investment in stocks and shares, but will instead continue consultations with financial institutions. The Treasury affirmed its ambition to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive investment into the UK economy, but will not make immediate alterations to the popular tax-sheltered savings products.

          <p>Gunmen in Pakistan's Balochistan province stopped two passenger buses and executed nine men of Punjabi ethnicity. The assailants reportedly checked passengers' identification cards, abducted ten individuals with Punjabi addresses, and later killed nine of them in the nearby mountains. While no group has claimed responsibility, President Asif Ali Zardari has blamed the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), an insurgent group seeking independence that has previously targeted Punjabis in the region. The attack highlights ongoing ethnic tensions and separatist violence in the mineral-rich province.</p>

          <p>Serbia is experiencing a new phase of civil resistance as an eight-month anti-government protest movement escalates into widespread civil disobedience. Protesters, initially led by students, are demanding a snap parliamentary election and have shifted to tactics like road blockades, leading to clashes with police and hundreds of detentions. Despite the government's use of force, the movement is decentralizing and gaining momentum across the country. President Alexandar Vucic has firmly rejected calls for an early election, but activists believe sustained pressure will make them inevitable.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of contraction and defying analyst expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the decline primarily to a drop in manufacturing, particularly in car-making and pharmaceuticals, along with weak retail sales. This downturn presents a challenge for the government, which has prioritized economic growth, and suggests a fragile outlook amid high inflation and interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a Native Hawaiian man, Kaulana Alo-Kaonohi, must be resentenced for a hate crime conviction, which could result in a longer prison term. Alo-Kaonohi and another man were found guilty of a racially motivated attack in 2014 against a white man, Christopher Kunzelman, who was attempting to move into their remote Maui village. The appeal court's decision challenges the initial judge's ruling that a hate crime enhancement could not be applied, while affirming the conviction itself. The case centered on the use of the word "haole" during the assault.</p>

          <p>The recent meeting between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted their shared political challenge: defending nuanced, patient policymaking in an era of rising populism. Both leaders, facing pressure from parties like Reform UK and National Rally, used their joint press conference on the new migrant deal to argue against the "politics of easy answers." They positioned their pragmatic, collaborative approach as the only viable way to deliver results on complex issues like immigration. The dynamic underscores the central political battle in both nations between establishment governance and anti-establishment movements.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a renowned IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) after 60 years of membership over planned strikes by resident doctors. He argued that the five-day walkout, scheduled amid a pay dispute, is ill-timed and erodes public trust in the medical profession by ignoring patient vulnerability. The BMA is proceeding with the strike after the government stated it would not negotiate further on pay. Lord Winston's high-profile departure adds a significant voice of dissent against the industrial action.</p>

Officials from across the political spectrum have been targeted, often fueled by misinformation on social media.

          <p>In a major ecological restoration effort, China has dismantled around 300 dams and small hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. The river is considered a last refuge for many rare and endemic fish species whose habitats and migratory routes have been devastated by decades of dam construction. The project aims to restore natural water flows, which had been severely restricted, threatening aquatic ecosystems and spawning grounds. This action represents a significant shift in policy towards prioritizing habitat conservation over small-scale hydropower generation in ecologically sensitive areas.</p>

The NAO also estimated the program's total cost could be more than triple the Ministry of Defence's forecast.
