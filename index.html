          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on a massive tax and spending bill central to the Republican agenda. The legislation, which includes increased spending for border security and defense offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition, faces a self-imposed July 4 deadline. Democrats are using the amendment process to force votes on controversial issues, while Republican leadership works to secure enough support for the bill's final passage amid some internal opposition. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iowa has become the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights protections, a law that took effect this week. The legislation defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and also prevents individuals from changing the sex designation on their birth certificates. This move, signed by Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, eliminates legal safeguards against discrimination for transgender and nonbinary Iowans in areas like employment and housing. The law also ends Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care, reflecting a broader trend of restrictions on transgender rights in Republican-led states.</p>

The bill faces a narrow path to passage in the Senate, with Republican leaders navigating internal opposition and Democratic amendments.

The White House is promoting the site's isolated and inhospitable location, surrounded by alligators and difficult terrain, as a deterrent to illegal immigration. The facility, which can hold 5,000 detainees, has drawn criticism from activists and Native American leaders over environmental impacts and its perceived cruelty. The administration views the location's harshness as a key feature to convey a strong message about immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that French cinema has largely failed to confront the nation's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, leaving French audiences to learn about the topic primarily from American films. The author notes that recent films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on anti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon are rare exceptions that finally explore these painful histories from a French perspective. Despite their importance and public interest, these films often struggle for mainstream visibility and recognition at major festivals. The article suggests that while audiences are ready to face this history, the French film industry remains hesitant.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since November, with analysts from firms like Goldman Sachs forecasting further appreciation through 2025. This trend is attributed to a more resilient-than-feared Chinese economy and growing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt, which is expected to weaken the dollar. The People's Bank of China has been setting a stronger daily reference rate for its currency. Goldman Sachs projects the yuan could break the 7 per dollar mark within six months and reach 6.9 in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI"â€”the ability to control their own AI technologies and data. This approach allows nations to create AI systems tailored to their specific languages, cultures, and priorities, rather than relying on English-centric models from major tech companies. Experts suggested that leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize AI development. This would enable regions like Southeast Asia to build a competitive AI ecosystem that reflects their unique contexts and fosters inclusive growth.</p>

          <p>A family in North Carolina is expressing deep concern that proposed federal cuts to Medicaid could jeopardize the healthcare of their 6-year-old daughter, who has a rare genetic condition. The family relies on a state Medicaid waiver program to cover over $4,000 a month in treatments and medications that their private insurance denies. They are among 600,000 people in the state who could lose access to care if the "big, beautiful bill" passes with its significant Medicaid funding reductions. State officials warn that such a large cut would inevitably lead to reduced coverage and benefits for many of the program's 3 million recipients.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County medical examiner has officially identified 54-year-old Kevin Devine as the 18th person to have died in the Eaton fire. Devine, an actor and substitute teacher, had been missing since the night the fire broke out in January. His remains were discovered in April on the street where he was last seen outside his Altadena apartment. The Eaton and Palisades fires in early January collectively claimed 30 lives and destroyed over 16,000 homes, marking one of the region's most destructive fire events.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect who ambushed firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, killing two and critically injuring a third. The sheriff stated that the suspect, who was found deceased at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, likely started the wildfire to lure the first responders. The victims were identified as veteran battalion chiefs Frank Harwood and John Morrison. Investigators have not yet determined a motive for the attack, but noted that the suspect had previously expressed a desire to be a firefighter.</p>

          <h2>UK Labour Party Faces Internal Division Over Proposed Changes to a Key Disability Benefit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 21:17:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to the benefits system, particularly the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). The government plans to tighten eligibility criteria for the disability benefit starting in late 2026, a move many of its own MPs oppose. Despite concessions from the Work and Pensions Secretary, dozens of backbenchers remain concerned that the changes are being driven by fiscal targets rather than the needs of disabled people. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is personally trying to persuade MPs, arguing the reforms are necessary for the long-term stability of the welfare state.</p>
