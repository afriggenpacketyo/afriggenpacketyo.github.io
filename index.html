          <p>Federal authorities have arrested over 30 individuals, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, in a major probe linking the NBA to organized crime. The investigation uncovered two distinct schemes: one involving insider information for sports betting and another centered on elaborately rigged high-stakes poker games. According to the FBI, this sweeping criminal enterprise involved multiple major crime families and defrauded victims out of millions of dollars, representing a significant breach of integrity for the professional sports league.</p>

          <p>President Trump has canceled a planned large-scale immigration enforcement operation in San Francisco that was expected to involve federal agents. The decision came after a conversation between the president and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who argued the deployment would hinder the city's economic recovery. The plan had drawn strong condemnation from state and local leaders, including California's governor, who had vowed to challenge any such federal action in court. Protests had already begun in anticipation of the agents' arrival.</p>

          <p>Shares of industrial conglomerate Honeywell surged after the company reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The positive results were driven by a strong rebound in its aerospace division and a record backlog of orders, indicating robust demand. In response to its strong performance, Honeywell raised its full-year guidance for sales and earnings per share. The company is also proceeding with its plan to spin off its Solstice Advanced Materials business into a separate publicly traded entity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have detailed the advanced cheating methods used in an illegal poker ring connected to the recent NBA gambling arrests. The scheme allegedly utilized technologies like X-ray tables to see cards face-down, pre-marked cards visible only with special contact lenses, and altered shuffling machines that could predict the winning hand. Unwitting victims, known as "fish," were reportedly lured into these high-stakes games by the presence of professional athletes, who were complicit in the scam. The operation was backed by several organized crime families.</p>

          <p>According to sources, a memo from prosecutors who investigated New York Attorney General Letitia James revealed evidence that weakens the mortgage fraud case against her. The memo reportedly concluded that any financial benefit James derived was minimal, around $800, and that vague federal mortgage guidelines would make proving intentional fraud difficult. The investigation's context is highly political, as it followed President Trump's calls for her prosecution and led to the ousting of a U.S. attorney who had resisted bringing charges against her.</p>

Despite their political opposition, both candidates have found common ground in their criticism of billionaire influence in the election, particularly calls for Sliwa to drop out to consolidate support for independent Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the journey of Money Singh, an immigrant from Punjab, India, who arrived in San Francisco at 19 and started as a cab dispatcher for $6 an hour. Overcoming initial depression and loneliness, he built a fleet of cabs before co-founding a successful barbershop and a marketing agency for drivers. Last year, his two businesses collectively generated over $2 million in revenue. Singh credits his success to the resilience and strong work ethic he developed during a challenging childhood.</p>

          <p>A former British paratrooper, identified only as Soldier F, has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder for his role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland. He was the only veteran prosecuted for the killings of 13 civil rights demonstrators. While the judge ruled that the evidence against Soldier F specifically was insufficient for a conviction, he strongly condemned the actions of the Parachute Regiment, stating they had lost all discipline and shot unarmed civilians who were fleeing.</p>

          <p>Two senior Democrats on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees are requesting that the Trump administration release all records related to the president's administrative claims seeking approximately $230 million from the Department of Justice. The claims are for damages related to the FBI's past investigations into Russian interference and the handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. The lawmakers argue that such a payment to a sitting president could violate the U.S. Constitution's Domestic Emoluments Clause, which prohibits such compensation beyond a salary.</p>

However, pursuing wealth for social comparison, power, or to overcome self-doubt is negatively correlated with life satisfaction and can lead to anxiety and depression.</p>
