          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with the formalization planned for the United Nations General Assembly in September. Citing a commitment to peace and the urgent need to stop the war in Gaza, Macron's decision makes France the first G7 nation to take this step. The move was met with strong condemnation from Israel and the United States, who argue it rewards terrorism, while the Palestinian Authority and other nations praised the decision as a positive step toward a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Thailand's acting Prime Minister has warned that ongoing border clashes with Cambodia, which have already killed at least 16 people, could escalate into a full-scale war. The fighting has reportedly spread to 12 locations and involves heavy weaponry, prompting civilian evacuations. Cambodia has accused Thailand of using banned cluster munitions, while Thailand rejects third-party mediation, insisting on bilateral resolution. The conflict, rooted in a century-old border dispute, has intensified recently, displacing tens of thousands and bringing life in the region to a standstill amid international calls for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Daniel Born, the deputy speaker of the state parliament in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, has resigned from his position after admitting to a significant transgression. The Social Democrat politician confessed to drawing a swastika on a ballot paper next to the name of a candidate from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Born described the act as a "serious mistake" and a "momentary lapse" in judgment. The state parliament had initially filed a criminal complaint against an unknown perpetrator before Born came forward and accepted the consequences for his actions.</p>

          <p>An NTSB report has concluded that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene "Buzzy" Peltola Jr., husband of then-Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by the aircraft being overloaded. The small plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum weight due to a large quantity of moose meat, and an unapproved external load of moose antlers was strapped to a wing strut. These factors degraded the plane's performance, leading to a loss of control shortly after takeoff near St. Mary's, Alaska, resulting in the fatal accident. The pilot was on his second trip of the day to transport the meat for a group of hunters.</p>

The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that pay has fallen by a fifth since 2008 after accounting for inflation, despite recent raises.

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the formal nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a move that allows her to serve in the role in an acting capacity. The decision came after a federal court in New Jersey declined to extend her initial interim appointment and instead named her deputy to the top post, sparking a leadership dispute with the Justice Department. By pulling the nomination, the administration sidesteps a legal provision that would have barred her from the acting role, though it sets up a continued clash between the executive branch and the judiciary over the position.</p>

          <p>A persistent heat dome that has brought extreme temperatures to the central U.S. is now moving east, with heat alerts affecting more than 100 million people from the Midwest to the East Coast. Forecasters predict temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average, with feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas through early next week. In the Corn Belt, the high heat is exacerbated by "corn sweat," a process where cornfields release thousands of gallons of water vapor, significantly increasing humidity and making the heat feel even more oppressive. Officials are urging caution due to the increased risk of heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>Despite declining poll numbers and internal rifts within the MAGA movement over issues like the Jeffrey Epstein files, an opinion article argues that President Trump's hold on power is not contingent on popular support. The author contends that tyrants often maintain control through intimidation, suppression of dissent, and by creating an "illusion of substantial improvements" rather than relying on genuine approval ratings. The article points to the administration's aggressive deportation campaigns and pressure on election officials as evidence of a strategy that prioritizes power consolidation over public opinion, urging resistance and organization in response.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new Arctic strategy, which includes a nearly $9 billion investment in icebreakers, is intensifying the geopolitical debate over polar shipping routes. As global warming makes the Northern Sea Route more navigable, the U.S. aims to reassert its presence in the region. Chinese scholars argue that this presents a strategic opportunity for China, a self-declared "Near-Arctic State," to develop these more efficient shipping lanes. They view the Arctic routes as a potential new pathway to counter what they describe as U.S. geopolitical containment, highlighting the growing economic and strategic importance of the rapidly changing region.</p>

While security and controlled access are key features, the main draw for many residents is the array of high-end amenities like golf courses and concierge services. Homes in these communities typically cost 5% to 20% more than comparable non-gated homes and come with mandatory HOA fees for upkeep. Despite the higher cost, these properties often see higher appreciation rates, making them a popular choice in the real estate market.</p>

This internal conflict is visible on platforms like TheDonald and X, where prominent MAGA influencers find themselves defending the White House against a base that has long been invested in the Epstein case.

The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) operates just four distribution centers, where over 1,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed since late May while seeking sustenance. Israeli soldiers have allegedly been ordered to use live fire for crowd control, turning the sites into what one soldier called a "killing field."

The inquest heard that Mr. Slater had consumed drugs and alcohol the night before he disappeared.

Trafford, a City academy graduate, is expected to sign a five-year contract and will provide competition for current number one, Ederson.
