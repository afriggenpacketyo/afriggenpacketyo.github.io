          <p>Newly released Justice Department transcripts reveal Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's jailed associate, denied witnessing any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. She also stated a rumored "client list" does not exist and dismissed allegations against Prince Andrew as "mind-blowingly not conceivable," despite an infamous photo. Maxwell is seeking a pardon from Trump, a move that has outraged Virginia Giuffre's family, who accuse the government of allowing Maxwell to "rewrite history" through her testimony. This article highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding Epstein's network and the political implications of Maxwell's statements.</p>

Once a vibrant cultural hub in the 1960s and '70s, Hamra's theaters and cafes fostered a diverse, secular environment that defied Lebanon's sectarian divisions, even surviving parts of the civil war. The cinema's revival symbolizes resilience amidst the country's severe economic collapse, political instability, and the aftermath of the 2020 port explosion.

          <p>Chinese companies are expanding operations in Southeast Asia, presenting a complex environmental picture as both a major clean energy investor and a contributor to polluting industries. Driven by stricter regulations in China and the allure of cheaper labor and weaker enforcement abroad, these firms are involved in nickel processing and rare earth mining, leading to environmental disputes and health risks. While China funds significant renewable energy projects, its involvement in pollution-heavy sectors often overshadows these green investments. This article underscores a growing pushback from local communities and questions about Southeast Asian governments' environmental commitment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, expanding a previous ruling that prevents the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. The judge deemed Trump's executive order, which sought to compel local cooperation with federal immigration agencies, likely unconstitutional and a violation of the separation of powers. This decision is the latest development in the ongoing legal battle over immigration enforcement policies between the federal government and local jurisdictions. The White House, however, maintains confidence in winning on appeal.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia claim the federal government is attempting to coerce him into a guilty plea for human smuggling charges by threatening deportation to Uganda. Abrego Garcia, previously wrongly deported to El Salvador, rejected an offer for deportation to Costa Rica in exchange for a plea. Following his release from jail, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reportedly ordered him to report to their office, indicating an intent to deport him to Uganda. His lawyers argue this is a vindictive effort to punish him for challenging his initial deportation and that his safety would be at risk in Uganda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts suggest that a significant portion of Americans are deficient in magnesium, a nutrient crucial for reducing stress, improving sleep, and easing anxiety. Incorporating magnesium-rich foods like dates and pumpkin seeds into one's diet or taking supplements can help address these deficiencies. Nutritionists recommend a simple bedtime snack of a Medjool date with pumpkin seed butter, noting the added benefits of fiber and protein for satiety. While magnesium is not a universal cure, it can be a missing link in nighttime routines, especially when combined with good sleep habits.</p>

Despite family advocacy and a "moderate risk" assessment, the board highlighted "antisocial personality traits" and a failure to prioritize rules.

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a halt to construction on the Revolution Wind project near Rhode Island, despite it being approximately 80% complete. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited unspecified "national security interests" for the stop-work order. This action aligns with President Trump's broader efforts to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy, which he has publicly criticized as a "scam." The decision has drawn strong criticism from Rhode Island and Connecticut governors, who view the project as crucial for meeting climate goals. Developers are now evaluating the financial impact and considering legal action, raising concerns about investor confidence in the US renewable energy market.</p>

This action follows a White House rebuke of a leaked DIA report that assessed American strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, which President Trump declared "flat out wrong." Senator Mark Warner warned that Kruse's sacking suggests Trump treats intelligence as a "loyalty test" rather than a safeguard for the country.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal of potential interest rate cuts led to a significant rally in cyclical and economically sensitive stocks, such as DuPont and Home Depot, while major tech stocks saw more modest gains.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high.
