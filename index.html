            <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time in response to lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter of 2025. The MAS reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER), while affirming its commitment to a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. This decision reflects concerns over declining manufacturing and services sectors, influenced by global trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S., leading to a downgraded GDP forecast of 0%-2% for 2025.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government's decision to exempt some electronic devices from tariffs has created confusion for Chinese electronics firms, as many smaller companies will not be covered, and new "sectoral tariffs" are planned. This inconsistent policy approach leaves Chinese businesses uncertain about how to navigate the changing trade landscape. Despite China's significant role in the global supply chain for hi-tech products, the future remains challenging for the electronics sector amid these fluctuating policies.</p>

            <p>Following a deadly helicopter crash on the Hudson River that killed five tourists and the pilot, New York Helicopter Tours has shut down its operations immediately, according to the FAA.

Senator Chuck Schumer called for increased safety inspections for other helicopter tour companies, accusing them of prioritizing profits over safety. The crash has renewed concerns about the safety of sightseeing helicopter excursions in New York City, prompting calls for stricter regulations or a ban on nonessential helicopter flights.</p>

The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) provides a similar approach, investing in treasuries with varying maturities and distributing monthly income. While ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs are also popular, bond ladders can serve a broader goal of protecting buying power and immunizing against liabilities (not investment advice).</p>
