          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The allegation, spearheaded by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, centers on potential mortgage fraud, claiming Cook improperly designated two different properties as her primary residence. Despite calls for her resignation from former President Trump, Governor Cook has stated she will not be bullied into stepping down and intends to provide accurate information to address any legitimate questions about her financial history.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the approximately $527 million financial penalty imposed on former President Trump and his co-defendants in his civil fraud case, ruling the fine was excessive. While the massive disgorgement was vacated, the court upheld other sanctions, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation. The deeply divided panel of justices expressed significant disagreement on the case's merits, leading to what one justice called a "remarkable solution" to avoid reargument. New York's Attorney General has announced plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents, are scheduled for separate parole hearings after their life sentences were reduced, making them eligible for release. The brothers have long maintained they acted in self-defense following years of abuse, a claim prosecutors have consistently rejected, arguing the motive was financial gain. Their case, which captivated the nation in the 1990s, has seen renewed public interest through recent media, and a support coalition is advocating for their release. The Los Angeles District Attorney's office remains opposed to their parole.</p>

          <p>Powerful waves from Hurricane Erin are threatening at least two beachfront homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina, pushing them to the brink of collapse. This area of the Outer Banks has already seen nearly a dozen similar homes fall into the Atlantic since 2020 due to persistent coastal erosion. Experts note that these barrier islands are naturally dynamic and ill-suited for permanent development, with some areas losing up to 15 feet of beachfront annually. The storm's impact highlights the ongoing and escalating risk that rising sea levels and erosion pose to coastal properties.</p>

          <p>Recent sharp market rotation out of premium-valued stocks appears to be slowing after a five-day losing streak for the S&P 500, as investors await Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's upcoming speech. In corporate news, Meta Platforms has reportedly paused its aggressive hiring of AI researchers and engineers, a move described as organizational planning rather than a slowdown in AI investment. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock fell after missing earnings-per-share estimates, and Boeing is reportedly in talks to sell up to 500 planes to China, signaling potentially positive trade developments.

          <p>A fire broke out on the USS New Orleans, an amphibious transport dock, while it was moored at the White Beach Naval Facility in Okinawa, Japan. The blaze burned for approximately 12 hours before being extinguished by the ship's crew, with assistance from another US warship and Japanese authorities. Two sailors sustained minor injuries during the incident, and the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet has launched an investigation into the cause of the fire. The incident draws comparisons to the 2020 fire that destroyed the USS Bonhomme Richard.</p>

          <p>The Trent Rockets defeated the Oval Invincibles by six wickets in The Hundred women's cricket competition, keeping their slim chances for qualification alive. Despite a mid-innings wobble while chasing a modest target of 110, Heather Graham's composed, unbeaten 19 runs guided the Rockets to victory with 16 balls remaining. The Invincibles' innings was hampered by a slow start and the loss of key wickets at crucial moments, with Meg Lanning's 45 being the standout performance. Both teams must now win their remaining games to have any hope of advancing in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Office has released new data showing a record 111,000 asylum applications in the year to June, though the government is also processing claims more quickly, reducing the overall backlog. While the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has slightly increased since the current government took power, it remains far below the 2023 peak. This mixed data suggests that while new arrivals are high, increased processing speed is preventing a significant spike in accommodation needs. The government's strategy is showing some effect in managing the system, but challenges remain with high small boat crossings and appeals.</p>

While acknowledging policy mistakes, such as keeping schools closed too long, the author warns that a narrative of total failure is a dangerous overcorrection that could undermine preparedness for future pandemics by eroding trust in public health institutions.</p>

The court heard how Brain used his charismatic authority to create a cult-like environment, manipulating followers financially and emotionally while sexually assaulting women within his congregation. Prosecutors argued that Brain exploited his position and the endorsement of the Church of England to isolate and abuse his victims, particularly through late-night massages where many of the assaults occurred. He was cleared of 15 other charges.</p>

          <p>Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted Africa's heavy reliance on imported vaccines, the continent is making progress toward greater self-sufficiency in pharmaceutical production. New manufacturing facilities are being established in countries like South Africa, Senegal, Rwanda, and Kenya, with a focus on producing vaccines for diseases such as malaria and yellow fever. Despite this momentum and renewed political commitment, significant hurdles remain, including a lack of infrastructure and funding. The African Union aims to produce 60% of the continent's required vaccines locally by 2040, a substantial increase from the current 0.1%.</p>

          <p>This article explores key teachings from the Baha'i faith that offer universal lessons on achieving a happier life, regardless of one's religious beliefs. It highlights five principles: having faith in the future, embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth, seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting pleasures, understanding that helping others is essential to one's own well-being, and adhering to timeless virtues over passing fads. Originating in 19th-century Persia, the faith emphasizes positivity and human progress, viewing worldly troubles not as cause for despair but as opportunities for growth and service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent successful fundraiser for anti-factory farming charities has highlighted the concept of "moral offsetting," where individuals donate money to mitigate the ethical guilt of eating meat. Proponents, like the organization FarmKind, argue it's a pragmatic way for sympathetic consumers who won't go vegan to still have a positive impact on animal welfare. However, the practice raises ethical questions, with critics worrying it absolves individuals of personal responsibility and normalizes a problem that requires systemic change. The debate underscores the challenge of aligning consumer behavior with widespread ethical concerns about modern animal agriculture.</p>

The retail giant has managed to mitigate some costs but has had to raise prices on certain items, a challenge also faced by competitors like Home Depot and Target. CEO Doug McMillon noted that while higher-income shoppers are still seeking deals, other customers are adjusting their purchasing habits in response to price hikes. The comments highlight the broad economic pressure tariffs are placing on retailers and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

Born in 1909, she is the last living subject of King Edward VII and has lived through two World Wars and numerous historical milestones. Caterham, who resides in a care home in Surrey, marked the occasion quietly with her family. She inherited the title of the world's oldest person earlier this year following the death of a Brazilian nun.

          <p>In a significant logistical feat, the 113-year-old Kiruna Church in Sweden has been transported three miles from its original location. The relocation is a key part of a larger, multi-year project to move the entire town center of Kiruna. This drastic measure is necessary because the ground beneath the old town has become unstable due to the expansion of a massive nearby iron-ore mine. The careful preservation and moving of the historic, Sami-style Lutheran church represents a critical effort to maintain the town's cultural heritage amidst profound industrial and geographical change.</p>
