          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what it terms the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This declaration follows a BRICS summit where leaders criticized unilateral protectionist measures and rising trade tensions. The statement did not specify which BRICS policies were considered anti-American, creating uncertainty for global trade partners. This move escalates the administration's aggressive trade stance, with letters detailing new country-specific tariff rates scheduled to be sent out, further roiling international economic relations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has found no evidence of a "client list" of associates connected to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, according to a newly released memo. The review, ordered by Trump-appointed leadership, also released footage that officials say further confirms Epstein's 2019 death in custody was a suicide, aiming to counter widespread conspiracy theories. The memo states that investigators did not uncover evidence to warrant charges against any uncharged third parties, a conclusion likely to disappoint those who believed Epstein's powerful associates would be implicated, and no further records will be released.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that nations siding with the BRICS alliance against U.S. interests will face an additional 10% tariff, a move that has drawn criticism from the bloc. During their summit, BRICS leaders condemned unilateral tariffs as a threat to the global economy and called for reforms to international financial institutions. The expanded alliance, which now represents over half the world's population, is positioning itself as a diplomatic counterweight to Western influence. Trump's threat continues his administration's confrontational trade policy, heightening geopolitical and economic tensions worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The 50-year-old was also found guilty of the attempted murder of a fourth relative, who survived after weeks in intensive care. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests during a family lunch in July 2023, while her defense claimed the mushrooms were included by accident and that she lied to investigators out of panic. After a nine-week trial, Patterson now faces a potential life sentence for the killings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk for forming a new political party, calling the move "ridiculous" and stating the tech billionaire has gone "completely off the rails." The rebuke follows Musk's announcement of the "America Party," a move stemming from a public falling out between the two over a tax and spending bill. Trump asserted that third parties only create "disruption and chaos" within the established two-party system. The feud marks a significant souring of the relationship between the former allies, with Trump also taking aim at Musk's previous push for electric vehicle mandates.</p>

This shift, driven by increased economic independence and changing social norms, is leading to rapidly aging populations and the prospect of depopulation in many high-income nations, including the U.S. While this trend offers environmental benefits and reflects greater individual freedom, it also poses significant challenges to economic growth, labor forces, and social safety nets like Social Security.

          <p>Across Europe, the increasing dominance of institutional investors in the residential housing market is a primary driver of soaring prices and a deepening affordability crisis. Since 2008, investment in European real estate by financial firms has tripled, turning homes into a lucrative asset class but making ownership unattainable for many. This trend, enabled by decades of privatization and deregulation, has inflated rents, reinforced inequality, and fueled political disenfranchisement, contributing to the rise of far-right movements. Critics argue that this financialization prioritizes investor returns over social need, creating a political timebomb as housing becomes a source of despair. (not investment advice)</p>

The therapy works by delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals from the ear to the brain. In a small-scale trial, all 10 participants with this specific genetic mutation showed hearing improvement, with younger children responding best. Researchers are hopeful this safe and well-tolerated treatment represents a major step toward developing therapies for other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>In the wake of devastating flash floods in central Texas that have killed nearly 80 people, questions are emerging about whether officials provided adequate warnings to residents and campers. Local authorities stated the severity of the flood, described as a nearly 30-foot wall of water, was unexpected and that some areas lacked reliable cell coverage for alerts. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued timely forecasts and warnings hours before the disaster. However, the tragedy has highlighted the challenges of communicating extreme weather threats and the potential desensitization of the public to frequent alerts.</p>

          <p>Following his feud with President Trump, Elon Musk's announcement of a new "America Party" faces a daunting reality, according to election law experts. Launching a new national political party involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws, meeting high signature thresholds for ballot access, and likely facing intense legal challenges from the established Republican and Democratic parties. While Musk's immense wealth could fund such an effort, the process is time-consuming and costly, making it a multi-year project that would be nearly impossible to establish by the 2026 midterm elections, highlighting the systemic bias towards a two-party system.</p>

          <p>An al-Qaeda offshoot, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), has become one of Africa's most lethal jihadist groups, driving a surge of violence across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017, the group has expanded its operations, exploiting local grievances and state weakness to recruit thousands of fighters and impose its strict interpretation of Islamic law. Despite international counter-terrorism efforts, JNIM's attacks have intensified, particularly in the last year, with the group claiming to have killed nearly 1,000 people since April. The escalating violence highlights the failure of military-led governments in the Sahel to contain the growing jihadist threat.</p>

          <p>At their summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders of the BRICS nations issued a joint statement calling for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence. The group described AI as a "unique opportunity" for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair governance. The statement emphasized the need for technical standards developed with public sector and UN involvement to ensure trust, security, and reliability. The bloc also called for equal access to AI technologies for developing nations and safeguards against using standard-setting as a barrier to market entry.</p>

          <p>The latest round of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and Egypt in Doha, has concluded without a significant breakthrough. According to a Palestinian official, the initial session involved exchanging messages but failed to narrow the considerable gaps between the two sides. Hamas is reportedly holding to its demands for a guaranteed end to hostilities and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops, conditions Israel has previously rejected. Negotiations are expected to resume as mediators continue efforts to overcome the obstacles that have derailed previous ceasefire initiatives.</p>

          <p>Two individuals were rescued from their SUV just moments before it was engulfed in a massive explosion after crashing into a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah. The crash ruptured a gas line, leading to a fiery blast that was captured on video and destroyed the restaurant. Two bystanders heroically pulled the driver and a passenger from the vehicle before the explosion occurred; they were later hospitalized. No one was inside the building at the time of the crash, and no firefighters were injured by the subsequent blast, which also caused significant damage to adjacent businesses.</p>

Containment has reached 30%, up from 10% the previous day, thanks to an influx of personnel and favorable weather conditions. The fire, which started near the Santa Barbara County line, is threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument and has prompted mandatory evacuations.

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo following a sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. Owner Mark Lerner cited the team's poor on-field performance as the reason for the change, stating a "fresh approach and new energy" is needed. Rizzo had been with the organization for over 15 years, building the roster that won the franchise's first championship, but the team has struggled through a difficult rebuilding period since.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people essential time away from work to grieve, acknowledging the significant impact of early pregnancy loss on both parents. The move has been welcomed by campaigners and the Miscarriage Association as a hugely important step in recognizing this form of loss.</p>
