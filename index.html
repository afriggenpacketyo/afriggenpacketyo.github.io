          <p>Romania is increasingly confronting its role in the Holocaust, specifically the genocide of its Sinti and Roma populations, known as the 'porajmos.' At a recent commemoration event in Bucharest, the country's new president and other officials called for a change in public discourse, which is often marked by hate speech. The ceremony honored the estimated 25,000 Roma deported to Transnistria and murdered during World War II, a history long suppressed in the country. Officials stressed that acknowledging this past is crucial for strengthening democracy and preventing future atrocities fueled by hatred.</p>

While its adoption by Wall Street signifies immense success, co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges the growth but expresses concerns about potential centralization.

The 56-year-old icon posted pictures of herself in a black string bikini and a netted cover-up while relaxing in a cabana. The photos were taken during a stop on her 'Up All Night' tour, where she appeared to be staying at the Rixos Radamis Hotel in Sharm El Sheikh. Her post follows a recent concert in Poland where she experienced a minor wardrobe malfunction, with her skirt falling off mid-performance.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man in Polk County, Tennessee, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill public officials and law enforcement officers. Authorities discovered 14 explosive devices in his home during the arrest. According to the Polk County Sheriff's Office, the suspect, Kevin Wade O'Neal, attempted to detonate the explosives as deputies arrived to apprehend him. He now faces nine counts of attempted first-degree murder, corresponding to the number of officers present, along with other weapons charges. O'Neal is currently being held in jail pending a bond determination.</p>

          <p>Police officers in England and Wales will receive a 4.2% pay increase, a figure slightly above the current inflation rate. The Home Secretary described the raise as a signal of gratitude, and it will be supported by an additional £120 million in government funding. However, the Police Federation, representing over 145,000 officers, criticized the award as insufficient, stating it "barely treads water" after years of real-terms pay cuts. While the National Police Chiefs' Council supported the increase, the federation argued it won't be enough to address issues like high resignation rates and mental health absences.</p>

          <p>Precinct DTLA, a prominent gay bar in downtown Los Angeles, has warned it may be forced to close due to a costly legal battle. A former employee, Jessica Gonzales, filed a lawsuit alleging she was discriminated against for being a heterosexual woman and that the owners ignored an unsafe work environment. The bar's owners have denied the allegations, claiming they are false and part of an anti-LGBTQ agenda by the plaintiff's lawyer, who has a history of using derogatory language. The owners stated the financial and emotional strain of the lawsuit is devastating their small business.</p>

          <p>In the fifth Test at The Oval, England is chasing a target of 374 runs to win the series against India. At the close of day three, England reached 50-1, needing another 324 runs for victory, after opener Zak Crawley was dismissed late in the day. India's second innings was anchored by a sublime century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and surprise fifties from Akash Deep and Washington Sundar, setting a formidable total on a pitch that has become more favorable for batting. The outcome of the match remains uncertain, with a potentially thrilling final day ahead.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reiterated its position that it will not disarm unless an independent and fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital is established. This statement is a direct response to a key Israeli demand in ongoing ceasefire negotiations and follows remarks attributed to a US envoy suggesting Hamas might be willing to lay down its arms. The declaration comes as several Western nations, including France and Canada, have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, increasing diplomatic pressure. However, Hamas maintains that the right to armed resistance is non-negotiable without statehood.</p>

This shift raises concerns about misinformation, though users often rely on community fact-checking in the comments.

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's policy of denying asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that while the administration can continue to deny discretionary asylum, it cannot use the policy to block migrants from applying for other mandatory humanitarian protections. These protections, including 'withholding of removal' and relief under the UN Convention Against Torture, are required by U.S. law for individuals who would face persecution or torture if deported. The ruling partially upholds a lower court's decision that found the president's proclamation defied federal statutes.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to combat the legacy of aquatic segregation that has left many Black Americans without swimming skills. The historical exclusion from pools has contributed to a stark disparity, with Black children being significantly more likely to drown than their White peers. Founder Paulana Lamonier aims to create a ripple effect by training more Black swimmers, who can then become instructors and lifeguards. Through scholarships and accessible lessons, these programs are providing opportunities for adults and children to learn vital water safety skills and overcome generational barriers.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man was arrested at Buffalo Niagara International Airport after allegedly commandeering a transport cart and using it to destroy moving walkways. The man, who authorities said was visibly intoxicated, was recorded on video driving the cart through airport hallways. Footage shows him driving down a walkway too narrow for the vehicle, crushing metal and shattering glass panels in the process. He faces multiple charges, including grand larceny and criminal mischief, for the destructive joyride, which caused significant damage to the airport infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has emerged as a leader in solar energy, adding more utility-scale solar capacity than California last year, driven primarily by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to favorable economics and a streamlined permitting process for projects under 75 megawatts, rather than state-level climate policies. However, the industry faces headwinds from the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop installations. Despite the challenges, large-scale solar remains economically competitive with natural gas, prompting continued investment in grid infrastructure and storage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is increasing its diplomatic pressure on Israel to address the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Following a visit by Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, the German government has urged Israel to allow the United Nations to safely transport and distribute aid, calling the situation "unimaginable." While reaffirming Germany's friendship with Israel, Wadephul also warned against international isolation and reiterated support for a two-state solution. This marks a sharper tone from Berlin, reflecting growing international concern over the suffering of civilians and the restrictions placed on humanitarian efforts in the region.</p>

Research published in 'Frontiers in Psychology' linked the Big Five personality traits to preferences for certain activities.

The findings suggest that if a particular exercise isn't enjoyable, trying a different activity better suited to one's personality may be a more effective long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 54, actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner is being remembered for his nuanced portrayal of Theo Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show.' Warner skillfully balanced Theo's teenage hubris with a complex vulnerability, evolving the character from a charismatic slacker into a young man with a sense of purpose. The character's journey, which included a diagnosis of dyslexia, challenged his parents' assumptions and provided a groundbreaking depiction of a young Black man finding his way. Warner's performance was central to the show's narrative, making Theo more than just a punch line.</p>
