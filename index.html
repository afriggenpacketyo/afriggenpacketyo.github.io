          <p>A growing number of prominent Jewish American groups, including traditionally staunch supporters of Israel, are publicly calling for increased humanitarian aid to enter Gaza amid warnings of a deepening famine. Organizations like the American Jewish Committee and the Reform movement have issued statements expressing sorrow for Palestinian civilian suffering and urging Israel to ensure aid reaches those in need. This shift reflects broader changes in public opinion and growing discomfort within the American Jewish community over the war's humanitarian toll, moving beyond just left-leaning activist groups.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, a landmark ruling marking the first criminal conviction of a former head of state in the country's history. The court found Uribe guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to right-wing militia groups responsible for atrocities during Colombia's civil war. While human rights groups have hailed the verdict as a crucial step for accountability, Uribe maintains his innocence and his supporters decry the case as a political vendetta.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man, Jon Ruben, has been charged with three counts of wilful ill-treatment of a child following an incident at a summer camp in Stathern, Leicestershire. The charges come after eight children and one adult became ill and required hospitalization, though all have since been discharged. Ruben appeared in court and was remanded in custody pending his next appearance at Leicester Crown Court. The police watchdog is also investigating the force's handling of the incident after they received initial reports of children becoming unwell at the camp.</p>

The new 210-member parliament will serve for a three-year transitional period, but the process is fraught with challenges. While the new electoral system offers hope, there is significant skepticism among minority groups and others regarding the transparency and legitimacy of the vote, particularly as interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa will appoint 70 of the seats himself.</p>

          <p>Several German states have expanded their use of Gotham, a powerful AI-driven surveillance software from US firm Palantir, raising significant privacy and civil rights concerns. The software allows police to rapidly analyze vast amounts of data, creating comprehensive profiles of individuals, but critics like the Society for Civil Rights argue it violates constitutional rights by ensnaring innocent people. A constitutional complaint has been filed against its use in Bavaria, highlighting fears over mass data analysis, opaque technology, and Germany's growing dependence on foreign tech giants.</p>

This decision is seen as a victory for immigrant advocates and the City of Los Angeles, which argued that the raids involved unconstitutional racial profiling amid the administration's aggressive enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data presents a complex and sometimes contradictory view of the U.S. economy's performance during President Trump's tenure, challenging White House claims of a consistent boom. While second-quarter GDP showed robust growth, it followed a first-quarter contraction, and the first six months of the year saw mediocre overall growth. The article highlights bizarre swings in trade figures driven by tariff uncertainty and a significant slowdown in job creation, suggesting a chaotic economic picture rather than a straightforward surge.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's second term reveals a pattern of foreign leaders using praise and flattery as a primary diplomatic tool to engage with him. Leaders from the U.K., Israel, and the European Commission have been observed offering effusive compliments and symbolic honors, a shift from the more skeptical approach of his first term. Experts suggest this strategy is a pragmatic recognition of Trump's personalistic leadership style and his position as the ultimate decision-maker, with leaders hoping to secure favorable outcomes on issues like trade and defense spending.</p>

          <p>A new comic from NPR's Life Kit delves into the common awkwardness people feel when receiving compliments and what this reaction reveals about self-perception. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao explain the science behind why praise can be difficult to accept. The piece argues that gracefully accepting kind remarks is not only beneficial for one's own self-esteem but also positively affects the person giving the compliment, making a case for embracing these positive social interactions instead of dismissing them.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up partially in the country. In a podcast interview, Badenoch, who was born in the UK, explained that she considers herself British by identity and has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s. She said her early experiences in Nigeria shaped her political views, and she returned to the UK at age 16 because her parents saw no future for her there due to the worsening political and economic climate.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, has left four people dead, including a bartender and three patrons. The incident is the ninth mass murder in the U.S. so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Authorities have identified the suspect as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, who lived next door to the bar and is now the subject of a manhunt in a nearby wooded area. The shooting prompted a lockdown in the small mountain town as residents were rattled by the violence.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Reveals Genetic Link Between the Potato and a Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 01:18:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pioneering study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary history of the potato, revealing an ancient link to a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event about nine million years ago between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuberous, potato-like plant. This discovery, published in the journal Cell, suggests that this ancient cross-breeding was the key driver for the development of tubers, the trait that makes the potato a global staple food today.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic Leagues Cup match, LAFC secured a 4-2 victory over Pachuca in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in regular time. The game saw early goals from LAFC's Dennis Bouanga and Pachuca's Elías Montiel, as well as red cards for both teams. Despite earning two points for the win, LAFC's chances of advancing to the quarterfinals are slim, as they needed an outright victory to stay competitive in the standings. The result leaves the Los Angeles club with only three points from two matches, likely ending their tournament run.</p>

          <h2>Experts Provide Guidance for Travelers Whose Holidays Are Affected by Wildfires</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a scorching summer that has sparked wildfires across Greece, Turkey, and other European destinations, travel experts are offering advice to concerned holidaymakers. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems it safe to travel to these areas, the situation remains volatile. Experts advise that standard travel insurance should cover cancellations or curtailments if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, for those who simply no longer wish to go, reimbursement is unlikely unless they have purchased specific catastrophe coverage, and they should contact airlines and hotels directly for potential solutions.</p>

          <h2>Kim Kardashian's Facial Shapewear Sparks Debate Over Extreme Beauty Trends</h2>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's Skims brand has launched a facial shapewear mask, capitalizing on a TikTok trend where users film themselves removing elaborate overnight skincare products. The £52 mask, which sold out quickly, is marketed to provide a "sculpted" jawline but has drawn criticism for promoting potentially harmful beauty ideals and profiting from insecurity. Medical professionals are skeptical, stating that while such wraps may offer temporary de-puffing, there is no scientific evidence for lasting contouring effects, and overuse could lead to skin irritation or other issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to growing user fatigue and a decline in usage, dating apps are introducing new features to keep the search for love online. Companies are experimenting with concepts like no-chat-before-the-date models, group dates, and premium, high-cost tiers to reignite interest in a market where users are tired of generic profiles and ghosting. This evolution reflects a broader sense that the established "swipe-and-chat" model is becoming stale, pushing platforms to find novel ways to facilitate genuine connections and counter the feeling of online dating as a chore.</p>
