          <p>New York City Comptroller and former mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by ICE agents at federal immigration court while observing proceedings. Lander's office claims he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of court to prevent their arrest by ICE. Video footage shows Lander being handcuffed while protesting the agents' authority. DHS stated that Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, while Lander's wife claimed he was asking for a judicial warrant, arguing that the actions were not in accordance with due process, and the ACLU of New York condemned the arrest as an abuse of power and a threat to democracy. The arrest sparked reactions from other politicians, including demands for Lander's release and condemnation of ICE's actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed an advanced method for detecting cancer using an experimental blood test. The study, published in Cancer Discovery, found that genetic material shed by tumors can be detected in the bloodstream up to three years before a cancer diagnosis. Researchers analyzed plasma samples from participants, identifying tumor-derived mutations in blood samples collected years prior to diagnosis. The lead author noted that earlier detection allows for earlier intervention and potentially more curable tumors, while senior authors emphasized the promise of multi-cancer early detection tests and the need to determine appropriate clinical follow-up.

Destroying Iranian nuclear facilities is difficult due to their underground locations, and Israel's ultimate goal remains unclear.

The legal battle centers on whether the president exceeded his authority by invoking Title 10 in response to protests against immigration raids.

          <p>The standard charge for car drivers using the Dartford Crossing will increase from Â£2.50 to Â£3.50 in September. Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood stated that the current charge is "no longer sufficient" to manage demand on the road, which connects Essex and Kent. Significant discounts will be available for local residents, and drivers with pre-pay accounts will pay a reduced fee. The new charges are lower than if they had increased in line with inflation since 2014, but the increase has drawn criticism from local MPs.</p>
