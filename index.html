          <p>Former Congressman George Santos insists he has taken full responsibility for his crimes ahead of his sentencing on April 25th. Prosecutors are seeking a prison term of over seven years, citing Santos's social media activity as evidence of his lack of remorse. Santos claims he can be both sorry and upset by the Justice Department's recommendation, stating that true remorse involves speaking up against absurd penalties. He also suggests his prosecution is fueled by political ambition, and that the government's sentencing recommendation is out of step with other political prosecutions. Santos pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in August 2024 after being expelled from Congress in December 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could significantly harm the global economy, potentially sparking a trade war. The IMF has lowered its global growth forecast for the year to 2.8%, down from 3.3% in 2024, and also slashed its prediction for U.S. growth to 1.8%. The IMF's chief economist noted the surge in policy uncertainty as a major driver of the revised economic outlook. While Trump has paused many reciprocal tariffs, China and Canada have already retaliated with their own tariffs, heightening concerns among investors about widespread trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The IRS's Direct File free tax-filing program, which saved users an average of $160 each, may be discontinued under the Trump administration. The program, launched during Joe Biden's presidency, has been praised for simplifying tax filing, but has faced criticism from private tax preparation companies like Intuit, which claim it wastes taxpayer dollars. Democratic lawmakers are urging the Treasury Secretary and IRS acting commissioner to keep Direct File operational, while Republican lawmakers argue that free filing programs already exist. The IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, with plans to eliminate up to 40% of its workforce.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Chinese citizens are working at a drone production site in Russia, suggesting Moscow may have "stolen" drone technology from China. Zelensky's comments come after he accused China of supplying weapons and gunpowder to Russia, which China denies. He also mentioned that Russia is recruiting Chinese nationals via social media to fight in its armed forces, and that Kyiv is trying to assess whether the recruits are receiving instructions from Beijing.</p>

          <h2>Trump Floats Tariff Revenue Replacing Income Tax</h2>

          <p>President Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax. Economists are skeptical of this proposal, noting that it is not realistic. While tariff negotiations are ongoing, the Trump administration has enacted sweeping tariffs, with rates on Chinese goods as high as 145%. This idea was first floated during his presidential campaign last year in a meeting with Republican lawmakers, but changes to the income tax would require Congressional legislation.</p>

The order aims to modify Medicare drug price negotiation rules, which could have huge implications for drugmakers, patients, and Medicare's spending on prescription drugs. The executive order also calls on the FDA to open up a pathway for more drug imports from Canada, where prescription medications are far cheaper.</p>
