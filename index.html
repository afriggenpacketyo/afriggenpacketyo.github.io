          <p>An individual, after being removed from a business, allegedly drove a vehicle into a crowd outside a music venue in East Hollywood, injuring at least 30 people. The incident, which police are investigating as an intentional act of assault with a deadly weapon, occurred early Saturday morning. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the car and assaulted him, with an unknown individual shooting him before fleeing the scene. The driver is hospitalized in police custody, while the shooter remains at large.</p>

          <p>Renewed sectarian clashes between the Druze community and armed Bedouins have persisted in southern Syria's Suweida Province, despite a ceasefire declared by the president. The violence has reportedly led to over 900 deaths, with both sides accused of atrocities and government forces allegedly siding against the Druze. Israel has intervened by striking government targets in Damascus to protect the Druze, and a US-brokered pact was established to halt the fighting. However, reports of gunfire and looting continued in Suweida city even after the deal was announced.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of The Open Championship, heading into the final round with a four-shot lead at 14 under par. Despite a brief challenge from Matt Fitzpatrick, Scheffler played a steady, unflappable round of 67, reinforcing his reputation for converting 54-hole leads into victories. His performance has created an air of inevitability around his pursuit of the Claret Jug, which would mark his fourth major title. China's Li Haotong sits in second place and will play alongside Scheffler in the final group.</p>

          <p>Former professional wrestling star Marcus "Buff" Bagwell has undergone surgery to amputate his right leg above the knee.

          <p>British and Irish Lions flanker Tom Curry delivered a powerful, man-of-the-match performance to lead his team to a 27-19 victory over Australia in their first Test match. Curry, who had faced some criticism regarding his form, was described as "immense" by coach Andy Farrell, making crucial tackles and scoring a try. His aggressive and relentless play, alongside fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne, set a physical tone from the start and was a key factor in the Lions' win. Curry's performance was seen as a definitive answer to any doubts about his place on the team.</p>

          <p>Nearly 100 people have been arrested at demonstrations across the United Kingdom held to protest the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The largest protest in London saw 55 arrests for displaying placards in support of the group, which is now a criminal offense. The ban followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. Protesters argue they are opposing genocide, while the government's action criminalizes support for the activist group, which has targeted arms companies.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open Championship after both were warned during their third rounds. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being warned for being a few minutes behind schedule on Saturday after first-round groups took nearly an hour over their allotted time. DeChambeau, who called the pace of play in the first two rounds "out of control," advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness, arguing the current approach is ineffective.</p>

The article follows the group's outreach on the Jersey Shore, a setting synonymous with hedonism, highlighting the challenge of their message in a secularizing and sexually open era. The activists frame chastity not just as abstinence but as a countercultural stance against the superficiality of social media and hookup culture. Their approach attempts to resonate with Gen Z's noted risk aversion and concerns about mental health and authentic connection.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Nationalist groups like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are fanning concerns over unruly tourists and crimes committed by foreigners. This rhetoric comes as Japan faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, creating a contentious debate over the country's need for foreign workers. These parties are adopting nationalist slogans similar to those used in Western far-right movements to appeal to voters.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the building collapse in the town of George last year, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation revealed that numerous serious safety concerns, including substandard materials and structural cracks, were identified and ignored long before the tragedy. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that red flags were continually raised, but work on the five-story apartment block continued.

Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller's framing of the issue, urging her to address the potential addiction and money control problems directly rather than treating it as a simple budget line item.
