          <p>A major power outage has impacted Spain and Portugal, including their capital cities, causing widespread disruptions. The outage affected transportation, communication, and other essential services, with authorities working to restore power. Portuguese distributor E-Redes attributed the outage to a problem with the European electricity system, leading to power cuts in specific areas to stabilize the network. Unconfirmed reports suggested the Lisbon subway system was halted and traffic lights stopped functioning, while Spanish radio reported partial evacuations in Madrid.</p>

This initiative is viewed as crucial for sustaining the fight if peace talks fail or U.S. arms shipments cease. Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day cease-fire in Ukraine next month, though its viability remains uncertain amid ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ+ Pride festivals across the U.S. are experiencing significant sponsorship challenges, with several companies reducing or withdrawing their financial support. Economic concerns and an increasingly hostile climate for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts are cited as reasons for the pullback. Pride organizations are reevaluating their partnerships with sponsors that have rolled back DEI policies or reduced support for the LGBTQ+ community. Despite these challenges, some corporations and small businesses continue to support Pride events, while organizations are seeking alternative funding sources.</p>

          <p>Several corporations, including Apple, Chobani, and Johnson & Johnson, have announced plans to expand their manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. since President Trump's second term began. These announcements coincide with the implementation of new tariffs, though not all companies directly attribute their decisions to the tariffs. The White House has promoted these moves as contributing to job creation on home soil. Economists remain skeptical that tariffs alone are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots, citing factors like labor costs and the regulatory environment as more influential.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing accessibility of private equity (PE) to retail investors presents both opportunities and risks. While it allows diversification and potentially higher returns, retail investors may lack the sophistication and resources of institutional investors. They may be offered less desirable opportunities and face challenges navigating the opaque nature of private equity. The fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to poor decision-making, and the illiquid nature of these investments can have severe consequences if investors need to liquidate their positions during a downturn.
