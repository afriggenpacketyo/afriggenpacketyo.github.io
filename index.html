          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:00:10 EDT</div>

          <p>A report from AI firm Anthropic suggests China is outpacing the United States in the artificial intelligence race, primarily due to superior energy infrastructure. China's power capacity expansion significantly dwarfs that of the U.S., which faces a concerning gap in meeting the massive energy demands of its growing AI sector. This disparity in power generation poses a strategic challenge for American technological competitiveness, as the AI industry is projected to require at least 50 gigawatts of power by 2028.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a bill that reduces the autonomy of the country's key anti-corruption agencies, sparking widespread protests and international concern. Critics argue the law places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) under the control of the prosecutor general, undermining years of democratic reforms. The move has drawn criticism from Western allies, including the EU, who have made anti-corruption efforts a key condition for financial aid and Ukraine's potential EU membership.</p>

          <p>Former UK cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has publicly shared her experience of being targeted by "deliberately humiliating and violent" AI-generated deepfake pornography. Speaking to the BBC, she highlighted the real-world consequences of such digital fabrications and called for stronger government action, including age verification for pornographic sites. Mordaunt, along with other female politicians, was revealed to be a victim, prompting new government plans to criminalize the creation and distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has taken disciplinary action, including suspensions and expulsions, against approximately 80 students involved in pro-Palestinian protests earlier this year. The protests included the occupation of a campus library and the establishment of an encampment, which the university stated were violations of its policies. This move comes as the university is under pressure from the Trump administration over alleged antisemitism and is working to restore federal funding by implementing policy reforms, including a new student disciplinary process.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, soared after the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal that lowers tariffs on imported vehicles to 15%. The reduction from a threatened 25% provided significant relief to Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its export economy that had seen shipments to the U.S. fall in previous months. The news prompted a market rally, with Toyota's stock jumping over 15% on the belief that the new tariff rate will be manageable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, the UK's top counter-terrorism and crime agencies, including MI5 and the NCA, have issued a joint warning to parents about the risk of children being radicalized online. The agencies are increasingly seeing young people exposed to extreme content, leading to desensitization and, in some cases, terrorism-related offenses. They are urging parents to be vigilant during the summer holidays, discuss online safety with their children, and use parental controls to mitigate the growing threat from violent online groups.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeff Daniels has once again voiced sharp criticism of President Donald Trump's supporters, stating he hopes they "are losing tons of money" due to the administration's tariff policies. In a podcast interview, the Emmy-winning actor argued that the financial pain from increased prices on goods is what will ultimately turn voters against the president. Daniels, a frequent critic of the GOP, characterized the president as a "snake oil salesman" and lamented the current political climate in the United States.</p>

          <p>A 13-million-year-old fossil of a "terror bird" leg bone discovered in Colombia features distinct teeth marks, leading scientists to believe the formidable predator was killed by an even larger one. By analyzing 3D scans of the bite marks, paleontologists matched them to an extinct, five-meter-long crocodilian species called Purussaurus. The finding provides rare evidence of an interaction between two apex predators of the era and suggests that the fearsome, human-sized terror birds were more vulnerable than previously thought.</p>
