        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a roughly 4% increase following a significant drop in market capitalization, triggered by a public disagreement between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggested that a potential truce between Musk and Trump could benefit Tesla shares, with Wedbush Securities noting the stock was oversold due to the news. However, a White House official stated that Trump was not interested in a call with Musk, adding uncertainty to the situation. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a public exchange of words between the two. The stock market is a volatile and sensitive beast.</p>

          <p>Tom Cruise has secured a Guinness World Record for performing a daring stunt in "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning," involving jumping from a helicopter and igniting a fuel-soaked parachute. Cruise executed the stunt 16 times, jumping from at least 7,500 feet, and had only three seconds to cut away the flaming parachute and deploy a backup. The stunt, which required holding a 50-pound camera rig, highlights Cruise's commitment to authenticity and pushing the boundaries of action filmmaking. This is Cruise's second Guinness World Record, adding to his box office achievement for consecutive $100-million-grossing movies.</p>

The sanctioned individuals include two Colombians and four Guyanese nationals, accused of trafficking tons of cocaine and bribing local government officials. Officials allege that Daby Jr. and Duncan are responsible for operating the largest drug trafficking organizations throughout Guyana, relying on semi-submersible narco submarines and aircraft to transport cocaine. The sanctions come as authorities attempt to crack down on homemade narco subs traveling through Guyana’s jungles, with the country's proximity to the Caribbean and alleged corruption along its borders facilitating drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with President Donald Trump was overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk, but the meeting was still seen as a win for Merz. Merz's agenda included strengthening relations between the U.S. and Germany, discussing tariffs, and addressing U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO defense spending. Merz gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate, emphasizing the family's connection to Germany, and highlighted Germany's plans for increased defense spending. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party was seemingly avoided, contributing to a positive outcome for Merz.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, a slowdown compared to recent months, as businesses cope with uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s trade war. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, but the report was dragged down by the loss of 22,000 federal workers' jobs due to the Trump administration's efforts to cut government positions. Economists expected a downward slump after data earlier in the week suggested a cooling job market. Trump once again called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in response to the report.
