          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, has reported to federal prison in Pennsylvania to begin serving his 57-month sentence for stealing nearly $17 million from the baseball star to cover gambling debts. In addition to the prison term, Mizuhara is required to pay $16.9 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1.1 million to the IRS. Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting to placing approximately 19,000 bets over two years and accumulating over $40 million in debt. Ohtani addressed the scandal, stating he never placed sports bets and that Mizuhara fabricated the story about paying off his gambling debt. </p>

U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee reported minor damage near the American Consulate in Tel Aviv, prompting the State Department to raise its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level.

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear an appeal from Chevron, Exxon, and other oil and gas companies concerning lawsuits seeking compensation for coastal land loss and environmental degradation in Louisiana. The companies are appealing a 2024 decision that kept the lawsuits in state courts, where a jury ordered Chevron to pay upwards of $740 million for damage to the state's coastline. Chevron argues that because it began oil production and refining during World War II as a federal contractor, the cases should be heard in federal court. Plaintiffs argue that the appeal is a stall tactic to avoid accountability, while Louisiana's Republican Governor Jeff Landry has made the state a party to the lawsuits. </p>

          <p>A federal jury in Colorado has found MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent election conspiracy theorist, liable for defaming Eric Coomer, a former employee of Dominion Voting Systems. Coomer sued Lindell after he was called a traitor and accused of stealing the 2020 election on Lindell's online platform. Dominion Voting Systems previously won a $787 million settlement in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, and Newsmax apologized to Coomer for airing false allegations against him.

Key differences include steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes and permanently extending the $10,000 state and local tax deduction (SALT). House Republicans have threatened to oppose the bill if the SALT cap is not raised, while Senate Republicans are calling for a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's comments on the Israel-Iran conflict have shifted between supporting Israel's strikes and distancing himself from them, creating uncertainty. He aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, ideally through a deal, but has varied between threatening force and pushing diplomacy. Netanyahu has pressured Trump to pursue military action, while some advisors support "maximum pressure" tactics. Trump faces pressure from Republicans in Congress to pursue regime change in Iran, but the potential for escalation poses significant risks, and planned talks with Iran have been abandoned. </p>

The American Association of University Professors has filed three other lawsuits against the Trump administration over related issues and has vowed to fight on.

The lawsuit challenges orders that cut off security clearances, contracts, and federal building access for law firms, often for taking on pro bono clients or engaging in diversity practices. The suit argues that Mr. Trump has used the vast powers of the Executive Branch to coerce lawyers and law firms to abandon clients, causes, and policy positions the President does not like, in violation of the First Amendment.

          <p>Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have finalized a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with Trump stating that the UK would be protected from future tariffs because he likes them. The deal covers aerospace and the auto sector, with the UK aerospace sector facing no tariffs and the auto industry facing 10% tariffs. The steel industry still faces 25% tariffs, although the two leaders pledged to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. Trump praised Starmer and the UK, stating that the prime minister has done a very good job.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health was "void and illegal." The cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), were deemed unlawful racial discrimination. The judge ordered that grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit be reinstated.

This marks the second time L.A. fire victims have sued insurers because they believe they were systematically underinsured.

          <p>A recent feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, triggered by disagreements over a tax and spending bill, may have solidified China's perception of Trump as an erratic politician. Musk, previously a significant Trump donor, criticized the president, prompting Trump to threaten the Tesla CEO's government subsidies and contracts. This incident could make China more cautious in negotiations with Trump and complicate considerations for a summit between the leaders. Observers suggest China views Trump as a transactional president who uses pressure tactics to maximize his own interests.</p>
