        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite headwinds from political opposition and supply chain issues, the onshore wind energy industry is finding new opportunities through 'repowering' aging wind farms. This involves upgrading or replacing older turbines with newer, more efficient models, increasing electricity output by up to 50%. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from this trend, reporting revenue increases and stock gains. Repowering existing sites offers economic advantages by avoiding property acquisition and potentially requiring fewer, more powerful turbines, contributing to a growing renewable energy sector and meeting increasing electricity demands.
