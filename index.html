          <p>Ukraine and the Council of Europe (CoE) have agreed to set up a special international tribunal to prosecute top Russian officials for the war in Ukraine. President Zelenskyy emphasized the need for justice for war criminals and signed an agreement with the CoE Secretary General Alain Berset. The tribunal aims to hold Russia's leadership accountable for the invasion in February 2022, filling the jurisdictional gap of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Logistical details are still being resolved, but the CoE hopes the tribunal will begin its work as early as next year, despite Russia not extraditing its own citizens.</p>

          <p>NATO leaders have agreed to a new defense spending target of 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, more than doubling the previous goal of 2%. President Trump praised the agreement as a win for the United States, highlighting his demands for allies to increase their defense spending. In 2024, NATO members spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with 22 of 32 members meeting or exceeding the 2% benchmark. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stated that his country will not meet the 5% goal, considering the 2% target sufficient.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two families in southwest Fresno have become first-time homeowners by building their own homes through the Mutual Self-Help Housing (MSHH) program. The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to collectively construct homes, reducing costs and fostering community bonds. The project, located near East Annadale Avenue and South Elm Avenue, represents a $1.46 million investment by the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis. The hands-on approach to construction has enabled these families to achieve the American dream and participate in the wealth of the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI assistant Claude was a fair use. The decision marks a victory for Anthropic, which was sued by authors for using copyrighted books without consent. However, the judge noted that Anthropic may have broken the law by using pirated books, ordering a trial to determine damages. The judge reasoned that using copyrighted works to train large language models is transformative, enabling the creation of something different rather than replicating the original works.</p>

          <p>Industry insiders at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin, also known as 'Summer Davos,' suggest that Chinese companies should relocate their entire manufacturing ecosystems to solidify their overseas expansions.

This involves building factories in new markets for both export and local sales, mitigating the impact of tariffs and trade tensions.

          <p>President Donald Trump's claim that U.S. strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites has sparked controversy and debate. Trump and his aides have defended the description, despite a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis suggesting the program was only set back by a few months. The strikes targeted facilities at Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo with massive bunker-buster bombs. Democrats have criticized Trump's language and questioned the accuracy of the administration's claims, leading to calls for further investigation and transparency.</p>

          <p>Senators from both parties are questioning the Trump administration's proposal to cut federal funding for public broadcasting and international aid programs. The White House argues that the targeted foreign aid programs are "antithetical to American interests," while funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) subsidizes a politically biased media system. Senators are concerned about the impact on local programming, emergency communications, and relationships with countries in the Middle East. The White House can afford to lose no more than three Republican votes in the Senate to pass the measure.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has issued a directive ordering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant integration of crypto into the traditional financial system, specifically within American home lending. The directive requires both housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars before loan closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated this aligns with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.</p>
