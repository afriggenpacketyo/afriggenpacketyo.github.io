          <p>The American Federation of Teachers has amended a lawsuit to seek class-action status against the Trump administration's Department of Education. The suit alleges that officials are illegally withholding access to affordable repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness. According to court records, over a million borrowers are caught in a backlog for income-driven repayment plan applications, with tens of thousands more awaiting decisions on public service forgiveness, potentially delaying relief for years.</p>

          <p>A frozen yogurt shop in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, named Grooveberries, is facing death threats and online harassment after creating tribute cups for the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The owners, Sarah and Chase Gibson, placed stickers with Kirk's photo and the years "1993-2025" on their cups to honor his legacy. Despite the backlash, which includes hateful emails and negative online reviews, the owners report a significant outpouring of support from their local community, which has emboldened their decision to continue the tribute.</p>

          <p>Paul Ovenden, a senior aide to UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, has resigned from his position as director of political strategy. The resignation follows the emergence of explicit and offensive text messages from eight years ago in which he recounted a graphic conversation about veteran MP Diane Abbott. In a statement, Ovenden expressed deep regret for the messages, which a Downing Street spokesperson called "appalling and unacceptable," adding to a series of recent high-profile departures and controversies within the Labour government.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison for the gross negligence manslaughter of their infant daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run to prevent the baby from being taken by social services, living in a tent on the South Downs during winter, where the baby died of hypothermia. The judge noted their lack of remorse and the disruptive behavior they displayed during the trial, which followed a 53-day manhunt that ended with their arrest in Brighton. The case is notable as Gordon was previously convicted of sexual assault in the US.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's radio show on Monday to pay tribute to his late friend. Vance, who described Kirk as a key political ally and a close personal friend, emphasized Kirk's significant role in the Trump administration's success and staffing. The gesture underscores the deep ties between Kirk and the administration, which also posthumously awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom and used Air Force Two to transport his body to Arizona.</p>

          <p>In a significant blow to the Conservative party, sitting MP Danny Kruger has defected to the rival Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage. Kruger, who served as a shadow work and pensions minister, declared that the Conservative party is "over" and no longer represents the main opposition to the left. At a press conference alongside Farage, he criticized his former party for a "rule of failure," citing bigger government and social decline, and expressed his hope that Farage would become the next prime minister.</p>

          <p>Following its collapse into administration earlier in September, the health and beauty chain Bodycare has announced the closure of an additional 30 stores. This move will affect another 235 employees, bringing the total number of job losses to 685 since the company's financial troubles began. Administrators cited the high cost of maintaining stores amid rising rents as a key factor in the retailer's decline. While there is interest from potential buyers for some of the remaining 85 stores, their future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Police in the Virgin Islands have released new CCTV footage showing the last known sighting of Sarm Heslop, a British woman who vanished from her boyfriend's yacht in March 2021. The video shows Heslop and her boyfriend, Ryan Bane, getting into a dinghy to return to his boat after an evening at a bar. Her family continues to seek answers, as Bane, who has never been formally questioned and is the sole person of interest, claimed she likely fell overboard. The case, which is the subject of a new BBC documentary, remains unsolved.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Hamas leaders will not have immunity "wherever they are," refusing to rule out further strikes following a recent controversial attack in Qatar.

The comments come amid international criticism of the attack on the U.S. ally, which has been a key mediator in the Gaza war.</p>

Hocker, who was boxed in on the inside lane, forced his way through a small gap, making physical contact with Germany's Robert Farken. The move was deemed "jostling" by race officials, a violation that results in an unfair advantage. Despite finishing second in the heat, the disqualification ended his run in the competition, and an appeal from the U.S. team was rejected.</p>
