          <p>Volodymyr Mykolaienko, the former mayor of Kherson, has shared his harrowing experience of being captured and tortured by Russian forces after the 2022 invasion. He spent over three years in captivity in various prisons, including one he described as "absolute hell," before being released in a prisoner exchange. Mykolaienko expressed profound pride in the Ukrainian people's resilience but also voiced dismay over the ongoing drone attacks on his hometown and the reluctance of some young men to join the war effort. His testimony provides a stark, personal account of the war's brutality and the betrayal he believes led to Kherson's rapid fall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts suggest that China's central bank is likely to implement monetary easing measures in the fourth quarter to support slowing economic growth. The forecast includes a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This projection is based on concerns about weakening economic momentum and a subtle shift in the People's Bank of China's official language, which now describes the economy with more caution. However, analysts note that the central bank might refrain from action if the annual growth target of "around 5 percent" remains achievable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially suspended his campaign for reelection, citing fundraising difficulties and persistent media speculation as undermining his bid. His withdrawal transforms the race into a three-way contest between Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' decision follows a challenging year marked by a federal corruption scandal and low poll numbers. While his name will remain on the ballot, his exit significantly reshapes the political landscape for leading America's largest city.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new mobile air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to one of its bases in South Korea for the first time. This system, which is similar in function to Israel's Iron Dome, is designed to counter threats such as cruise missiles, drones, and rockets.

          <p>As national retail chains close stores, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers and strip malls are creating new opportunities for small and local businesses. Landlords, facing softening demand, are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents that were previously out of reach for smaller enterprises. This trend is allowing businesses like wellness practitioners, independent retailers, and service-based companies to secure prime commercial real estate. While the opportunities vary by region, the shift is enabling a new mix of local tenants to revitalize spaces once dominated by large national brands.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that human-induced climate change could lead to a public health crisis by altering the habitats of venomous snakes in India. Researchers found that as global temperatures and humidity rise, the "Big Four" venomous snake species are likely to shift their geographic ranges into new areas, particularly northern and northeastern states. This migration is expected to increase human-snake interactions, especially in agricultural regions, raising the risk of fatal snakebites. The study's authors stress that climate change is not just an environmental issue but also a direct threat to public health that requires proactive medical and safety planning.</p>

          <p>In response to the deadly shooting at a church in Michigan, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced that the LAPD will increase its patrols around the city's thousands of houses of worship. The move is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of congregations across Los Angeles. The Michigan attack, in which a gunman killed four people and set a church on fire, has been condemned as a reprehensible act of violence. The increased police presence in L.A. reflects a heightened sense of alert and a commitment to protecting vulnerable community spaces from similar threats.</p>

          <p>The article explores the concept of "energy vampires"—friends who drain your emotional energy through constant complaining, self-centeredness, or a need for attention. Psychologists identify signs of such relationships and suggest that how you feel after an interaction is a key indicator. To manage these friendships, experts recommend setting clear boundaries, such as limiting the time spent together or the topics of conversation. They also suggest having an honest conversation about how the dynamic feels, as a true friend will be receptive to the feedback, which can help preserve the relationship.</p>

          <p>In what is being described as the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, more than 100,000 federal government workers are scheduled to formally resign on Tuesday. This mass departure is part of a Trump administration program aimed at significantly reducing the size of the federal workforce. The event coincides with a looming government shutdown deadline, as the White House has also instructed agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if a funding deal is not reached. Departing employees have cited months of "fear and intimidation" and a loss of job security as reasons for leaving their posts.</p>

          <p>For Hong Kong to achieve its ambitions as a hub for green marine fuels, it must establish a reliable supply chain for green methanol, according to an executive from CM Energy. While the city has already facilitated fueling with LNG and biodiesel, the infrastructure for methanol is still lacking. The call for action was made during the maiden voyage of the "CM Hong Kong," the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on methanol. As Europe implements carbon-based import tariffs, the shipping industry faces growing pressure to adopt cleaner fuels, making the development of methanol infrastructure crucial for Hong Kong's port.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation into the Schoen Clinic York, a specialist eating disorder unit, has uncovered multiple allegations of unsafe practices and staff misconduct. Whistleblowers and former patients provided photographs of staff sleeping while they were supposed to be monitoring vulnerable individuals at risk of self-harm. Patients also reported being served unhygienic food and being dismissed with triggering language by inexperienced staff. The private clinic, which received NHS funding for patients, has since closed its eating disorder unit, but the revelations have prompted serious concerns about the quality and safety of care provided to seriously ill patients.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking an expedited review from the U.S. Supreme Court regarding its executive order that aims to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. After lower federal courts blocked the order, the administration has petitioned the high court for a definitive judgment, hoping for a decision by next summer. The executive order challenges the long-held interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The move represents a significant legal and political battle over a foundational aspect of American citizenship, with potentially far-reaching consequences.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have confirmed that the gunman who attacked an ICE facility in Dallas was acting alone and specifically targeting federal agents. An investigation revealed notes at the suspect's residence showing animus towards ICE and indicating the attack was planned. The shooter used a legally purchased rifle from a nearby rooftop to fire on the building and vans containing detainees. The attack resulted in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others before the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officials blamed "wild rhetoric" for an increase in assaults on ICE personnel.</p>

          <p>The UK's political landscape is dominated by a heated debate on immigration, with the Prime Minister labeling Reform UK's policy proposals as "racist." In response, Labour's Home Secretary is set to announce a tougher immigration stance at the party's conference, aiming to counter Reform's growing popularity. This includes proposals for a "good citizen test" and sanctions for unemployed youth who refuse work placements. The exchanges highlight the central role immigration is playing in British politics, as both major parties attempt to address voter concerns and fend off the challenge from Nigel Farage's party.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing the action is unlawful and based on false pretenses. Governor Tina Kotek stated that the president's characterization of the city as "war ravaged" is "pure fiction," and that local law enforcement has the situation under control regarding small protests outside a single federal building. The lawsuit contends that the president lacks the authority to federalize the state's guard under these circumstances, accusing the administration of flexing political muscle rather than addressing a genuine public safety crisis.</p>

Business leaders who initially backed the party have expressed a "desperate loss of faith" following a budget that included a £25 billion rise in employers' National Insurance. While the government points to recent major tech investments as a sign of confidence, many smaller businesses feel forgotten and burdened by rising costs and new employment regulations. The upcoming Labour conference is seen as a critical opportunity for the party to rebuild its relationship with the business community.</p>
