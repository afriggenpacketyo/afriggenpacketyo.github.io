          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing. The machine, composed of four modules manufactured across different countries, is more advanced and expensive than its predecessors. Intel was the first to commercially install High NA in its Oregon chip fabrication plant in 2024. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet explained that advancements in machines like High NA drive down the cost of chip production, creating more opportunities. The article highlights how High NA improves chip speed, performance, and yield by projecting chip designs at a higher resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prisoners in England and Wales, including some serious offenders, will be eligible for release after serving a third of their sentence under new reforms. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood clarified that the most serious offenders and those jailed for terror offenses would not be eligible for early release. The government is also considering making chemical castration mandatory nationwide for some sexual offenders. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick criticized the plans, while Mahmood emphasized the need to address prison overcrowding. The reforms are inspired by a model in Texas that rewards good behavior with early release.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un publicly criticized military officials and shipyard operators after a newly built destroyer was damaged during its launch. The vessel became unbalanced and punctured, leading Kim to blame officials for "absolute carelessness." Experts suggest the incident occurred due to workers' unfamiliarity with large warships and the rushed nature of the launch. The damaged vessel is likely similar to North Korea's first destroyer, unveiled last month, which is equipped with nuclear-capable missiles. Despite the setback, North Korea test-fired multiple cruise missiles shortly after the incident, showcasing its continued weapons development efforts.</p>

          <p>Walmart is cutting approximately 1,500 jobs from its Global Tech team as part of a restructuring effort to increase efficiency. The layoffs will affect corporate employees, not store associates. The company aims to "speed up decision-making" and "remove layers and complexity" in its organizational structure. This restructuring involves eliminating some roles while creating new ones, as Walmart adapts to the rapidly evolving technology landscape. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has approximately 1.6 million employees and 4,600 locations in the United States.</p>

          <p>Alberta, a conservative Western province in Canada, is laying the groundwork to hold a referendum on seceding from Canada following a protracted political transition and amid concerns over President Trump's tariffs. The movement is fueled by a perception that the federal system unfairly limits Alberta's oil and gas resources. Premier Danielle Smith says she seeks leverage to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with the federal government, primarily to unshackle the province's oil industry from climate change regulations. Prime Minister Mark Carney, an Albertan native, is trying to balance addressing Alberta's concerns while maintaining national unity, with some Albertans open to joining the United States. </p>

          <p>According to workplace expert Zach Mercurio, effective leaders excel at making small talk, which involves personal conversations that foster genuine connections with employees. Mercurio's research indicates that employees value these interactions more than traditional perks like promotions or pay raises. Meaningful small talk helps employees feel seen, heard, and needed, particularly for remote workers and those in underappreciated roles. By showing sincere interest in employees' lives and well-being, leaders can build trust and improve workplace rapport.</p>
