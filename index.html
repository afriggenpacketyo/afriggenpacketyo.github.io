          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran has promised retaliation, potentially targeting U.S. military assets in the Middle East, the Strait of Hormuz, or through asymmetric warfare like terror and cyber attacks. Security expert Burcu Ozcelik suggests U.S. military installations in the Gulf are vulnerable due to Iran's short-range ballistic missiles. Closing the Strait of Hormuz could cause a global energy crisis, with oil prices potentially surging, though this could harm Iran's own interests. The U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System has warned of a heightened threat environment, including potential cyber attacks by pro-Iranian actors. The article analyzes the potential retaliatory actions Iran might take and their possible consequences.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. is recalling approximately 200,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs from model years 2021-2025 because of a potential defect in the door latches. The electronic door latches may remain locked after a driver or front seat passenger exits, possibly trapping rear seat passengers. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) stated that notification letters to owners were scheduled to be sent on June 23. Ford dealerships will address the problem by updating the vehicles' software, with the remedy expected to be available by late September.</p>

          <p>China's exports of hi-tech goods to the European Union experienced a significant surge last month, coinciding with a notable drop in exports of the same goods to the United States. This shift suggests that ongoing trade and technology tensions between the U.S. and China may be influencing trade patterns with Europe. China's exports to countries like Estonia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, and Hungary saw substantial increases in May compared to the previous year. The EU's trade deficit with China increased by 22% in May, driven by a rise in lithium-ion battery exports.</p>

          <p>Senator Markwayne Mullin states that U.S. intelligence indicates Iran did not move nuclear material from its Fordo facility before the recent U.S. airstrikes, contradicting earlier reports. Mullin, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, claims that U.S. intelligence suggests Iran may have even stored more material at Fordo, believing it to be impenetrable. He asserts that the U.S. has severely damaged Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. Mullin warns that if Fordo's nuclear production capabilities were not completely destroyed, the U.S. will work with allies to finish the job.</p>

          <p>Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website's new rule, which bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow, violates antitrust laws. Compass claims that Zillow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition. Compass seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites. Zillow says Compass' claims "are unfounded" and that it will fight the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Former acting ICE director Jonathan Fahey suggests that the Biden administration's border policies may have exacerbated the threat of Iranian sleeper cells within the U.S. Fahey argues that the large number of "gotaways" (individuals who illegally cross the border and evade capture) during the Biden administration provided opportunities for adversaries to send individuals into the country for espionage or harmful purposes. He notes that approximately half of the 1,500 Iranian nationals who entered the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration were released into the country. The Department of Homeland Security has issued a bulletin warning of potential domestic terrorism from Iranian-backed or inspired individuals.</p>

Novo Nordisk began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies to combat a nationwide shortage and shift patients from using knock-off versions.

          <p>The share of children growing up in large families (three or more children) in Germany has been increasing in recent years, primarily due to immigration since 2015, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis). Families with a migration background were found to have three or more children nearly twice as often as families without foreign roots. In 2024, 19% of migrant families had at least three children, compared to around 10% of other families. Larger families were slightly more common in the western federal states.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has announced a plan to allow non-domiciled residents to pay a £250,000 fee to avoid some UK taxes, with the proceeds going to people on the lowest incomes.

Critics argue that the measure could result in a loss of tax revenue and may not effectively benefit the lowest-income households. Labour and Conservative parties have criticized the proposal, with Labour calling it a "golden ticket for foreign billionaires" and Conservatives deeming it "fantasy economics."
