            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen recently visited El Salvador to advocate for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. Van Hollen emphasized that his mission was to ensure Abrego Garcia's right to due process, as the administration has admitted to the wrongful deportation. He warned that denying constitutional rights to one person jeopardizes the rights of all Americans, stating the administration is flouting the courts. Van Hollen recounted Abrego Garcia's traumatic experience in prison and stressed the importance of upholding the rule of law. Optimism score: 45</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in Alaska's LNG project to navigate Trump's tariffs and secure trade deals. The Alaska LNG project, valued at over $40 billion, aims to build a pipeline for exporting natural gas to Asia. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted the project's potential role in trade negotiations, aligning with Trump's goal of reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The project has three major pieces: The pipeline, a gas processing plant on the North Slope and a plant to liquify the gas for export at Nikiski, Alaska. Optimism score: 65</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry determined that the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month was due to an "operational misunderstanding". The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, further blaming poor night visibility for the misidentification of the vehicles as ambulances. The report also indicated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, but did not produce evidence for any affiliation to Hamas. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. Optimism score: 30</p>

            <p>Officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have revised the death toll from a recent boat fire significantly downward, now reporting 33 deaths instead of the previously reported 148. The incident occurred at the confluence of the Congo and Ruki rivers near Mbandaka, with the boat believed to be carrying around 400 people. The Mbandaka mayor attributed the initial discrepancies to confusion and Congolese police believe cooking onboard the vessel ignited the blaze. Boat accidents are common in Congo due to overcrowding and lack of safety measures. Optimism score: 40</p>

The company's sales tripled in a week, indicating potential "panic-buying" and a shift towards used devices. Analysts agree that prolonged tariffs could increase demand for refurbished electronics, particularly smartphones. While most smartphones and computers are manufactured in China, Trump issued a temporary exemption for those products on April 11, but subsequently announced plans to introduce specific tariffs targeting electronics that could take effect as soon as May.

            <p>As investors near retirement, they can protect their savings from tariff volatility by rebalancing their portfolios, building cash reserves, and considering a bond ladder. Rebalancing involves adjusting asset allocation based on risk tolerance and timeline, while building cash reserves provides a buffer against early losses. A bond ladder, where bonds mature at different intervals, can provide a steady stream of income. It's best to avoid selling investments when the stock market is down, especially during the first few years of retirement. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 65</p>
