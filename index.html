          <p>The Trump administration has increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, doubling the previous rate. President Trump stated that the prior levies were insufficient to bolster the U.S. industry, leading to this decision.

          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a significant drop, falling as much as 13%, due to investor disappointment over the Toyota Group's $33 billion deal to take the company private. This move occurs amid increasing pressure on Japanese firms to dissolve long-standing cross-shareholding ties. Toyota had utilized cross-shareholding since 2005 to fend off acquisition threats. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for Toyota Industries shares at a price lower than the previous day's closing, with financing supported by loans from major banks.

          <p>A decision to exclude the question of Palestine from Denmark's national school elections has ignited controversy, with critics arguing it contradicts the country's commitment to freedom of expression. The speakers of parliament justified the ban by deeming the issue too sensitive for classroom discussions. Critics contend that this decision reflects the governing parties' failure to address the moral implications of their foreign policy, particularly concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This situation exposes a scandalous flaw in Denmark's current order, where personal sensitivities are prioritized over free speech.</p>

However, experts point to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011, as a prior achievement.

The Reserve Bank of Australia previously cut rates to 3.85% in May to stimulate growth and address rising global trade risks.

          <p>A recent muon experiment has been deemed 'hugely successful,' but its findings have provided limited clarity regarding fundamental questions in physics. The deviant behavior of this subatomic particle could potentially indicate undiscovered forms of matter and energy within the universe, though further research is needed to confirm this. While the experiment has generated significant data, its implications remain uncertain. The results contribute to the ongoing quest to understand the nature of the universe.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, faces immediate challenges, including navigating trade relations with the US under President Trump. Trump's tariffs on Korean imports and demands for increased payment for military protection pose economic and security concerns. Lee also aims to improve relations with China, South Korea's neighbor and trading partner, while maintaining a strong alliance with the US. The situation creates a complex diplomatic landscape for the new president.</p>

          <p>As women's football gains popularity in Europe, Japan is striving to follow suit and elevate its WE League. The UEFA Women's Champions League has seen record-breaking attendance, illustrating the sport's growing global status.
