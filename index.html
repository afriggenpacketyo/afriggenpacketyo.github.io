          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has suspended his campaign for re-election, citing intense media speculation and the withholding of campaign funds as undermining his ability to compete. His withdrawal reshapes the race, which now primarily features Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The decision follows a tumultuous year for Adams, marked by low poll numbers and a federal corruption investigation, though he maintains his innocence. Political figures from both parties acknowledged his service and accomplishments, including reduced violent crime and pandemic recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Amir Amiri, an American citizen detained in Afghanistan for nine months, was released and is returning to the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the release and extended thanks to Qatar for its role in securing Amiri's freedom. Qatari diplomats had been coordinating with the U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs since March to facilitate the release, monitoring Amiri's health and maintaining communication with American officials. Since the Taliban took control in 2021, Qatar has represented U.S. interests in Afghanistan and has previously assisted in the release of other American citizens.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a significant overnight missile and drone assault on Ukraine, with the capital city of Kyiv bearing the heaviest impact, resulting in at least four deaths, including a child. Ukrainian officials reported that air defenses intercepted a large number of the nearly 600 drones and 48 missiles targeting multiple regions across the country. The attack, which damaged residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, occurred as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for more international support at the United Nations. The bombardment also prompted a defensive military response from neighboring Poland, which deployed fighter jets as a precaution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moldovans have voted in a critical parliamentary election that is seen as a choice between closer integration with the European Union and aligning with Russia. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu accused Russia of “massive Russian interference” aimed at destabilizing the country, a claim echoed by security forces. The election pits Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) against the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc in a tight race. The outcome is considered crucial for the nation's future direction, especially given its strategic location between Ukraine and Romania and the ongoing economic and security challenges posed by the regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the season, has formed in the Atlantic and is projected to strengthen into a hurricane as it approaches the southeastern United States early this week. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm will bring torrential rainfall, with potential for flash flooding and mudslides in the Bahamas and Cuba. A tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of Florida's east coast, with coastal areas from Florida to the Carolinas expected to receive significant rainfall. South Carolina's governor has already declared a state of emergency in preparation for the storm's potential impact.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that a government shutdown is probable unless Democrats alter their negotiating stance on a new spending bill ahead of the October 1 deadline. In an interview, Trump expressed confidence that the public would support his position, which focuses on cutting government spending and linking any healthcare discussions to immigration policy. A source close to the president indicated that Trump privately welcomes a shutdown, believing it would grant him executive authority to reduce certain government programs. The White House has already instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs if funding expires, escalating the high-stakes confrontation with congressional leaders.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to send military troops to Portland, Oregon, to manage what he described as "domestic terrorists" and protect federal facilities, particularly an ICE building that has been a site of frequent demonstrations.

Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor have strongly opposed the deployment, stating there is no insurrection or need for military intervention in the city.

He argued that the administration is targeting political enemies and attempting to rewrite history regarding events like the January 6th insurrection and the handling of classified documents. Cobb expressed concern that the judicial system's ability to resist such political pressure is being tested, especially with what he sees as a compliant Congress.</p>

          <p>As Hurricane Humberto strengthens over the Atlantic, there is a possibility it could interact with the newly formed Tropical Storm Imelda, potentially creating a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms get close enough to orbit a common center, sometimes merging or altering each other's paths. According to meteorologists, this outcome is unlikely in the current scenario because Imelda is significantly weaker than Humberto. While Humberto is expected to remain at sea, Imelda is forecast to bring heavy rainfall to the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

The hurricane is expected to remain a major storm for several days, generating large swells that will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.

While President Trump has previously denied similar requests, his growing frustration with Russia's refusal to negotiate a peace deal has led to a reconsideration. Tomahawk missiles, with a range of up to 2,500 kilometers, would significantly enhance Ukraine's capacity to strike military targets deep within Russian-held territory.</p>

He warned against underestimating the political challenge Labour faces in upcoming elections and argued for a more compelling narrative to connect with voters. His comments come as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer seeks to downplay internal criticism and frame the party's policy differences with Reform.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order signed by President Trump aims to provide 401(k) investors with greater access to alternative assets like private equity, which were previously limited to accredited, high-net-worth individuals. While proponents argue this democratizes investment opportunities, financial experts caution against the potential risks for average retirement savers. These private assets are often illiquid, opaque, and carry higher fees compared to traditional index funds, making them difficult to sell in a downturn. Analysts advise that investors should approach these new options with caution, consulting a financial advisor and allocating only a small portion of their portfolio to such higher-risk investments.

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with top bipartisan congressional leaders in a last-ditch effort to prevent a government shutdown, as a funding deadline approaches. The meeting comes after Trump previously canceled a similar discussion, accusing Democrats of making "unserious" demands. The primary point of contention is the Democratic push to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Republicans argue should be debated separately from the government funding bill. With federal agencies already preparing for furloughs, the outcome of the high-stakes meeting remains uncertain, as both sides continue to blame each other for the impending crisis.</p>

          <p>The new film "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, debuted at the top of the domestic box office with $22.4 million. The adult drama, loosely based on a Thomas Pynchon novel, met industry expectations and continued a successful streak for Warner Bros. studios. The film tells the story of a former revolutionary who must rescue his daughter, and its strong opening demonstrates DiCaprio's continued ability to attract audiences. Despite a competitive market for adult-oriented dramas, the film benefited from strong critical reviews and awards season buzz.</p>

          <p>This article presents the full text of the poem "Syncretism" by Nina C. Peláez. The poem explores themes of family, belief, and inherited trauma through the lens of the speaker's relationship with her father. It contrasts the father's rejection of formal religion and therapy with his ritualistic swimming, using vivid imagery of fire and water to depict his internal anger. The piece delves into the cyclical nature of this anger, originating from a childhood incident involving his own father. Ultimately, the poem reflects on the speaker's attempt to find forgiveness in the absence of a clear ideological framework.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system, with 50.4% in favor. This revised proposal addresses privacy concerns that led to the rejection of a similar plan in 2021 by ensuring the system is state-run and data is stored only on users' smartphones. The digital ID is intended to simplify online bureaucratic procedures, such as verifying age or signing contracts. Despite these safeguards, opponents argued the measure could still undermine individual privacy, reflecting Switzerland's strong tradition of data protection.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a significant public health crisis as its diabetes prevalence has nearly doubled over the past two decades, now affecting over 16% of the adult population, the highest rate in Europe. Health experts attribute the dramatic rise primarily to national food policies, lifestyle changes, and high consumption of carbohydrates and sugars, including starch-based corn syrup. Critics argue that the Turkish health system is failing in early diagnosis and management of the disease, with a high number of hospital admissions for uncontrolled diabetes. The country also has the highest rates of obesity and overweight individuals in Europe, a major risk factor for the disease.</p>

This ad hoc approach to tariffs is making trade relations turbulent, as European businesses struggle to determine which products might be affected next.
