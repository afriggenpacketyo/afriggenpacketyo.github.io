          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly pursuing an equity stake in Lithium Americas, a Canadian mining company, leading to a significant 100% surge in its stock. This proposed investment is linked to renegotiating a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a critical source of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. The White House aims to mitigate taxpayer risk and strengthen the U.S. critical mineral supply chain, marking a continued effort to take direct ownership in vital resources. This potential deal, which could require Canadian approval, signifies a strategic move in securing future energy independence. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of Americans who rely on food stamps could see reduced benefits or lose access entirely due to new stricter work requirements and aid calculation changes. These changes stem from a Republican tax and spending law, with estimates suggesting 2.4 million people could be cut off and 22.3 million households affected by smaller monthly amounts. The article highlights that these restrictions, expanding work requirements to older individuals and removing internet costs from deductions, are implemented during a period of rising grocery prices and increasing poverty.

          <p>The Trump administration announced that 2 million illegal immigrants have been removed or self-deported from the U.S. in the first eight months of his second term, setting a record pace for such actions. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that 1.6 million individuals voluntarily self-deported, while 400,000 were removed by federal law enforcement. This initiative, described as making American communities safe and ending open borders, includes ramping up deportation capacity with new detention facilities like Alligator Alcatraz. The administration emphasizes its clear message for those in the country illegally to self-deport or face arrest and deportation.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell indicated the league might renegotiate its media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. This accelerated timeline could add billions to the NFL's revenue, driven by the league's dominant TV viewership and recent lucrative deals secured by other sports leagues. While requiring agreement from current partners like Disney and Amazon, this move offers both stability for media companies and increased financial flexibility for the NFL, potentially impacting the salary cap and team valuations. Regulatory considerations, such as ESPN's pending deal, and a potential 18th regular-season week could influence the timing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to deploy the National Guard to Memphis to combat crime is criticized as a replica of a previous failed strategy, according to this article. His executive memorandum focuses on "hypervigilant policing" and "saturation-style enforcement" for minor infractions, which the Justice Department previously deemed ineffective at reducing violent crime and discriminatory against Black residents. While Memphis faces a severe crime problem, critics argue this approach will further erode community trust and overlook root causes like gun violence, exacerbated by a state law allowing permitless open carry. The plan also faces logistical and budgetary challenges, delaying troop deployment.</p>

The median price of a new home also saw a slight increase year-over-year, though many builders reported cutting prices in September. While strong sales reduced inventory, single-family housing starts and permits slowed, suggesting builders anticipated less demand.

          <p>Italy's defense minister condemned a suspected drone attack by unidentified perpetrators on the Global Sumud Flotilla, which was attempting to breach Israel's naval blockade of Gaza to deliver aid. Italy deployed a Navy frigate to assist its citizens on board the 52 boats. The flotilla reported explosions, drones, and communications jamming, accusing Israel of a "dangerous escalation," though Israel has not commented but previously warned against breaching the blockade. This incident follows prior attacks on flotilla vessels and occurs amid a confirmed famine in Gaza City, with the UN urging unimpeded humanitarian access.</p>

          <h2>Trump's UN Speech Met with Silence, Not Laughter, Signaling Shift in Perception</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent UN General Assembly speech, marked by personal grievances and attacks on global policies, was met with silence rather than the laughter his 2018 address received. Body language expert Peter Collett noted that delegates are now taking Trump more seriously due to his global influence and "erratic actions," indicating a shift in the political zeitgeist. Trump's body language is consistently designed to convey dominance and an "alpha" role, but his speech, which included false claims about London's mayor and climate change denial, was primarily aimed at his political base. The article highlights the contrast between his previous reception and the current, more serious international response.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a one-week suspension by ABC, expressing regret that his comments about Charlie Kirk's murder were perceived as making light of the tragedy. Kimmel clarified his intention was not to blame any specific group but acknowledged how his remarks could have been ill-timed or unclear. The suspension followed political pressure and threats from FCC Chair Brendan Carr, prompting a debate on free speech and media censorship. While some affiliates preempted his return, Kimmel emphasized the importance of a free press and the right to political satire, despite ongoing criticism from President Trump and a previous $16 million settlement related to a sexual assault defamation lawsuit.</p>

          <p>This opinion article characterizes President Trump's UN General Assembly speech as an "embarrassing performance," filled with personal grievances and attacks on the UN, European leaders, migration policies, and clean energy. The author notes a shift from his first term, where he generally stuck to prepared remarks, to an "unfiltered and unleashed" Trump. The speech included a decades-old grudge about a UN renovation contract, false claims about London's mayor Sadiq Khan and Sharia law, and denial of climate change science. The article concludes that Trump sought attention and adoration through fear and chaos, highlighting the divisive nature of his address on the global stage.</p>

          <p>This opinion article warns that massive investments in large language model (LLM) AI, totaling over $717 billion in three years, are unsustainable given the current vast gap between capital expenditure and end-user revenue. Author Roger McNamee, a veteran tech investor, argues that while Big Tech, journalists, and politicians are bullish on AI, many current players are bound to fail, leading to catastrophic effects for equity investors. He highlights that multiple Big Tech companies are pursuing global monopolies in LLMs, but historical precedent suggests only a few can be profitable in a competitive industry. The article suggests a reckoning is coming when investors demand adequate returns, and many will be severely disappointed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker expressed regret over winning Wimbledon at just 17, citing the immense pressure and scrutiny it brought throughout his life and career. Becker, who faced a turbulent private life and financial difficulties, including a prison sentence, reflected that such early success made it challenging to mature and navigate a second career. He found inspiration in Novak Djokovic's Wimbledon success while incarcerated, which helped him gain perspective. Becker now takes accountability for his past actions, acknowledging that his early fame led to a lack of boundaries and ultimately contributed to his downfall.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's influential vaccine panel, ACIP, has issued new recommendations that weaken Covid shot advisories and voted against a combination MMRV vaccine for young children. These changes, driven by new members critical of vaccines, could complicate access and increase public confusion, despite health experts advising continued vaccination for high-risk groups. While some states and insurance plans aim to preserve broader vaccine access, the article highlights the potential for reduced uptake and a return to higher infection rates for diseases like hepatitis B, which the panel also considered delaying the birth dose for.

          <p>The Maasai community in Tanzania is facing increasing pressure and forced relocations from their ancestral lands around Lake Natron, driven by government conservation plans and tourism development. Park rangers are accused of confiscating livestock and enforcing new restrictions, threatening Maasai survival, while human rights organizations report violations. Despite official claims of "voluntary relocations," testimonies describe a system of pressure, including the shuttering of services and burning of homes. Activists argue that this model of conservation, often supported by foreign organizations, prioritizes profits and "protected areas" for outsiders over indigenous rights and traditional land stewardship, leading to significant human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>A Lowy Institute study indicates China has become Southeast Asia's leading external partner, surpassing the U.S. in influence across six of the region's eleven countries. China's economic clout, particularly in trade, investment, and tourism, is identified as its "strongest card," accounting for a significant portion of the region's exports and imports. While Southeast Asian nations aim to diversify to avoid over-reliance on any single power, many remain highly exposed to China in key sectors. The index measures influence across economic, defense, diplomatic, cultural, and regional engagement aspects, highlighting China's growing prominence and the evolving geopolitical landscape.</p>
