          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral race, just two days before early voting commenced. Adams, who withdrew from his re-election bid in late September, publicly supported Cuomo, describing their alliance as a necessary coming together of "brothers" to protect the city. He harshly criticized Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani's rent freeze proposals and characterized him as an "existential threat" and a "snake oil salesman." Cuomo, running as an independent, echoed Adams's sentiments, highlighting Mamdani's socialist platform and questioning his experience and stance on issues, particularly after Mamdani's comments regarding 9/11 were deemed Islamophobic. This article details the political maneuvering and sharp rhetoric defining the final days of the campaign.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 17:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company exceeded Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations, yet it lowered its 2025 financial guidance due to a significant supplier plant fire. The blaze at an aluminum supplier's New York plant is estimated to cost Ford $1.5 billion to $2 billion, disrupting production of its highly profitable trucks and SUVs. The automaker plans to offset much of this impact by ramping up production and adding 1,000 workers next year. Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, expressed confidence in mitigating the long-term effects, with the impacted part of the plant expected to restart sooner than anticipated. This article details the financial performance and strategic responses to an unforeseen supply chain disruption, alongside the impact of tariff changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Rare Earth Export Controls Seen as Retaliation for US Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 17:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's implementation of rare earth export controls is portrayed as a direct and justifiable response to the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies targeting Chinese entities. The article contends that the US provided Beijing with both the methodology and justification for such restrictions through its own actions. These included blacklisting 23 Chinese institutions, imposing tariffs on various Chinese goods, expanding export controls to potentially tens of thousands of subsidiaries, detailing port fees on Chinese-listed vessels, and sanctioning Chinese refineries involved with Iranian oil. This perspective suggests that China's move is a calculated "blowback" to a sustained campaign of US economic pressure, escalating global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth, are facing criticism for their silence regarding Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner's Nazi-style "Totenkopf" tattoo. This comes after they previously condemned Secretary of War Pete Hegseth for his tattoos featuring Christian symbolism associated with the crusades. Platner, a progressive Marine veteran, apologized for the skull-and-crossbones tattoo, claiming he got it in 2007 without knowing its historical associations, and has since covered it. Critics highlight the perceived double standard, while Senator Bernie Sanders, who endorses Platner, dismissed the tattoo controversy as less important than other issues. This article from Fox News points to a partisan divide in addressing controversial symbols.</p>

          <p>A website titled "Expose Charlie's Murderers," which emerged following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is now accused of scamming donors after reportedly collecting over $30,000 in cryptocurrency before vanishing. The site had promised to identify Kirk's critics for a "largest firing operation in history," claiming to employ advanced data science and justifying crypto donations for its "impervious" system. The group, which later rebranded as the Charlie Kirk Data Foundation, ceased posting on X in late September, prompting accusations of exploiting Kirk's death for profit from its own supporters. This article details a fraudulent scheme that capitalized on a high-profile tragedy, highlighting the risks associated with anonymous online fundraising.</p>

          <p>Danny Rohl's inaugural game as Rangers head coach resulted in a routing defeat, immediately exposing "red flags" regarding the team's deep-seated issues. The article criticizes the squad's persistent timidity, defensive frailties, and apparent lack of character, a significant drop from their previous strong European showings. Despite Rohl's philosophy of speed and intensity, the players displayed familiar problems, indicating a crisis of confidence. The poor performance of an £8m striker is highlighted as emblematic of the club's questionable investment strategies and poor decision-making. This article emphasizes that Rohl faces an enormous task beyond mere coaching, needing to rebuild the team's psychological resilience and address systemic failures.</p>

          <p>The recent 6% drop in gold prices, the largest single-day decline in over a decade, has sparked interest in whether now is an opportune time to buy, particularly from major retailers like Costco. This article suggests that, generally, gold remains a worthwhile purchase during price dips, as historical trends indicate such declines are often temporary. Costco provides a convenient and potentially more reliable avenue for acquiring physical bullion, with the added benefit of waived shipping costs for members. However, it emphasizes that Costco's gold sales are final, requiring careful consideration before purchase.

          <p>Tensions are rapidly escalating between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, just eleven months after a fragile ceasefire agreement. Recent Israeli attacks, including a strike on a Hezbollah training camp and the killing of a commander, have heightened fears of renewed full-scale conflict. Both parties accuse each other of violating the November 2024 ceasefire, which stipulated Israeli withdrawal and Hezbollah's disarmament. Lebanon, already mired in a severe political vacuum and economic crisis exacerbated by past conflicts, finds its stability gravely threatened. This article details the precarious security situation, the persistent deadlock over Hezbollah's military capabilities, and the potential for a wider regional conflagration.</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have fallen to near a two-year low, with a 5-year loan averaging 8.11%, potentially offering homeowners a timely borrowing opportunity. This article highlights that despite ongoing economic anxieties, strong home equity levels across many regions make these loans a viable option for those needing funds. Compared to personal loans or credit cards, which carry significantly higher interest rates, home equity loans offer a more cost-effective solution. While minor Federal Reserve rate cuts are expected soon, their impact on home equity loan rates is projected to be negligible, suggesting that locking in a favorable rate now could be a strategic financial move.

Although Rivian saw a 32% increase in third-quarter sales as consumers rushed to benefit from the expiring credits, the company has reduced its 2025 delivery forecast.
