The company plans to sell 25 million shares, aiming to raise as much as $825 million, even as a government shutdown threatens to slow IPO market activity. Beta Technologies, which has yet to turn a profit, joins other electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft makers like Joby and Archer in going public.

          <p>A divide has emerged within the Federal Reserve, with Governor Stephen Miran advocating for an aggressive half-percentage-point interest rate cut, while Governor Christopher Waller supports a more cautious quarter-point reduction. Both officials acknowledge a weakening labor market and geopolitical tensions as factors, but differ on the appropriate speed of monetary easing. Waller expressed concerns that cutting rates too quickly could reignite inflation, while Miran believes current economic conditions warrant a larger cut. The conflicting statements highlight the uncertainty facing the central bank, which is expected to lower rates at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a fundraising dinner with corporate executives from companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google to finance a new $200 million ballroom for the White House. The administration states the project is fully funded by private donations, a move that has drawn criticism from some Democrats. During the event, Trump also showcased a model for a proposed triumphal arch to be built in Virginia, which he stated was dedicated to himself. The projects are part of a series of renovations Trump has undertaken since returning to the White House.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is not expected to stop the processing of most mortgages, but it could create delays for certain borrowers.

Key issues such as security, the decommissioning of weapons, and the logistics of rebuilding are complicated by ongoing tensions and Israeli restrictions on materials like concrete.

          <p>Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy traveled to New Jersey to campaign for Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, framing the 2025 gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia as crucial barometers for the 2026 midterms. Ramaswamy stated that GOP victories this year would "set the table for even bigger and more decisive victories" in the following year, including in his own race. The visit is seen as an effort to energize the Republican base in New Jersey's competitive election. Ramaswamy, endorsed by Donald Trump, is currently the only major Republican candidate in Ohio's 2026 gubernatorial contest.</p>

          <p>Police in Trinidad and Tobago are investigating whether two of their citizens were among six people killed in a recent U.S. airstrike on a boat in international waters near Venezuela. The Trump administration claimed the strike targeted "narcoterrorists" transporting drugs, part of a series of military actions that have killed at least 27 people in the region. The mother of one of the missing Trinidadian men, a 26-year-old fisherman, questioned the legality of the strike, stating that maritime law requires interception rather than destruction of a vessel. The incident has heightened scrutiny of U.S. military operations in the Caribbean.</p>

After scattering the ashes of his late partner, Hilaree Nelson, at the summit, Morrison navigated the extremely steep and dangerous route, reaching the base in just over four hours. The descent, which is technically demanding and prone to avalanches, required him to abseil down a 200-meter section of bare rock. This historic achievement was Morrison's third attempt and serves as a tribute to Nelson, who died in a mountaineering accident in 2022.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a case concerning the last major provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The case challenges whether using race to create a majority-minority voting district, a remedy for past discrimination, is itself unconstitutional. Voting rights advocates like Stacey Abrams warn that a ruling against the provision could effectively dismantle the act, potentially allowing states to draw discriminatory maps with impunity. Such a decision could significantly alter the composition of Congress, with estimates suggesting Democrats could lose between six and nineteen seats.</p>

Between September 2023 and March 2025, reports of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation rose substantially among the 1,689 participants aged 13 to 24. The research also found that strong family support and affirming environments were linked to significantly lower odds of suicidal thoughts. Conversely, exposure to conversion therapy, which reportedly doubled during the study, was associated with worse mental health outcomes, highlighting the impact of social and legislative environments.</p>

          <p>Californians are set to vote on Proposition 50, a proposal to redraw the state's congressional map in an effort to create up to five new Democrat-held seats. The measure is a direct response to a Republican-led redistricting in Texas, which is expected to give the GOP a five-seat advantage. While many California voters expressed distaste for gerrymandering, some view the proposition as a necessary tactical move to ensure fair representation in Congress amid what they see as a national effort to rig elections. The proposed maps would be temporary, lasting for three election cycles until the next census in 2030.</p>

This makes California the first state to sell its own brand of generic drugs, a move intended to drive down healthcare costs for residents, particularly those without insurance who can face costs of over $400 for a vial.
