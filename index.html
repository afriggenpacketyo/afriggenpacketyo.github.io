          <h2>Indian Batsmen Resist England After Ben Stokes Achieves Century Milestone</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India mounted a strong resistance, closing the fourth day at 165-2 in their second innings, still trailing England by 137 runs. This effort was led by an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78*) and KL Rahul (87*), who defied an England attack missing its key player, Ben Stokes. Earlier, England's captain Ben Stokes scored his 14th Test century, a knock of 141 runs, propelling his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win and clinch the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant heat wave is impacting the U.S. Midwest and Southeast, with the National Weather Service issuing extensive heat advisories. Regions from Florida to Virginia are experiencing temperatures in the upper 90s, with heat indexes projected to reach between 105 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit. A persistent high-pressure system, known as a heat dome, is trapping hot air over these areas, causing temperatures to be 10 to 15 degrees above average. Officials are urging residents to take precautions, such as staying hydrated and limiting outdoor activities, to prevent heat-related illnesses affecting over 30 million people.</p>

          <p>A major security operation is underway in South Ayrshire, Scotland, as U.S. President Donald Trump engages in a private visit, including playing golf at his Turnberry resort. While the visit has proceeded without incident at the resort, hundreds of protesters have gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to demonstrate against his politics. During his trip, Trump is scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. The visit has sparked debate over its cost and the strain on police resources, while also coinciding with the Scottish government's funding announcement for a tournament at Trump's other course.</p>

Other notable items included diverse soy-based products like freeze-dried tofu, seasonal Japanese produce, and convenient ready-to-eat healthy meals.

In response to mounting international pressure, U.S. President Trump announced that the leaders of both countries have agreed to meet immediately to negotiate a ceasefire.

          <p>An internal analysis by USAID officials found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The report, which examined over 150 reported incidents of aid loss between October 2023 and May 2025, concluded that in most cases, the perpetrators could not be identified. These findings appear to contradict repeated claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify altering aid distribution channels in Gaza. The State Department and the Israeli military have strongly pushed back against the report's conclusions, maintaining that significant aid diversion by Hamas is occurring.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis argues that Israel's offer to allow aid airdrops into Gaza is an act of desperation that will not solve the growing hunger crisis. The article contends that while airdrops can appear as decisive action, they are a crude and inefficient last resort compared to ground transport, delivering far less aid and often inaccurately. Past experiences in conflict zones like Iraqi Kurdistan and Bosnia have shown that airdrops can lead to civilian casualties and chaos as desperate people compete for scattered supplies. The piece concludes that only a sustained, unrestricted ground-level aid operation, facilitated by a ceasefire, can effectively address the starvation threatening Gaza's population.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected the attempt to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature where it currently lacks a majority. For a recall to pass, it required support from over a quarter of eligible voters in a district, a threshold that was not met. The outcome means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance from the KMT and its allies, complicating his policy agenda.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee are formally requesting a copy of a "birthday book" compiled for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which is reported to contain a letter signed by President Donald Trump. In a letter to Epstein's estate, Representatives Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia stated the book is relevant to congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation. The request comes amid increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release more files related to the convicted sex offender. President Trump has denied the existence of the letter, calling the report a "FAKE" and filing a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's optimistic projections for driverless cars and a widespread robotaxi service, Tesla investors are showing increased concern over the company's immediate financial challenges. Following a dismal earnings report showing a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive sales, Tesla's stock fell significantly. Investors appear to be focusing on current issues like thinning profits, rising competition from lower-cost EV makers, and the potential impact of expiring regulatory credits. The market's skeptical reaction suggests that futuristic promises are no longer enough to overshadow the company's present-day performance struggles in a competitive market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political analysts on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed why the controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein has become a persistent issue for the Trump White House. Panelists argued that President Trump is struggling to deflect the issue because it resonates with his base's core belief that powerful elites operate by a different set of rules. By appearing to defend the powerful in this case, Trump is seen as contradicting his populist message. This perception has allowed a once-fringe conspiracy theory to evolve into a major political controversy that is consuming Washington and proving difficult for the administration to shake.</p>

          <p>A U.S. research team has discovered the presence of PFAS, also known as 'forever chemicals,' in many reusable period products like underwear, menstrual cups, and pads. The study, led by the University of Notre Dame, found that nearly a third of the tested products contained these toxic substances, which are linked to serious health issues including cancer and fertility problems. Since PFAS do not decompose, they pose a dual threat by being absorbed through the skin and by contaminating the environment upon disposal. Researchers are urging consumers to demand PFAS-free products to pressure manufacturers into discontinuing their use.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old dog trainer with no symptoms, was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) after a pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring on his lungs. IPF is a progressive and fatal disease with no known cure, where scar tissue buildup prevents oxygen from entering the bloodstream. After medications failed and his lung function deteriorated, he was given less than a year to live. Kennedy ultimately received a successful double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic, a procedure that has given him a second chance at life and a renewed perspective on training hospital therapy dogs.</p>

With Liverpool having already signed two new forwards this summer and pursuing another, Diaz's position at the club appears uncertain despite being under contract until 2027.

One possibility is that Trump could visit China for bilateral talks either before or after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea.

          <p>In an effort to manage political fallout, President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. The move comes as the White House faces intense scrutiny over its handling of the Epstein investigation files and speculation about Trump's past relationship with the late financier. Legal experts suggest that while the grand jury transcripts may offer some insights, more significant information likely exists in unreleased FBI and DOJ investigation files.

          <p>As the Trump administration alters federal student loan programs, more employers are offering student loan reimbursement benefits to attract and retain talent. This trend is supported by a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which permanently made employer contributions of up to $5,250 per year tax-free for employees. Companies like Nvidia and New York Life are among a growing number providing this benefit, recognizing the financial strain that debt places on their workforce. With federal options changing, these employer-provided programs are becoming an increasingly important lifeline for workers managing their student loans. (not investment advice)</p>

The article argues that the album's sound, a departure from Bieber's previous pop work, taps into the current cultural mood, favoring soothing, melancholic tones over high-energy anthems. Influenced by indie producers, the album features aqueous, R&B-inflected production that feels both comforting and complex. This downtempo yet engaging style reflects a broader trend in popular music, suggesting listeners are seeking more reserved and emotionally nuanced sounds for the summer season.</p>
