          <p>Following violent clashes during an immigration raid at a California cannabis farm, President Trump announced he has given U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents "Total Authorization" to protect themselves. He directed officials to instruct law enforcement to arrest protesters using "whatever means is necessary." The statement came after protesters allegedly threw objects at federal agents during an operation at Glass House Farms, where one farmworker later died from injuries sustained during the chaos. The move was framed as a necessary measure to maintain law and order and show respect for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Jellycat, the popular British soft toy company, has abruptly stopped supplying its products to more than 100 independent shops across the UK, citing a new "brand elevation strategy." The decision, communicated via a form email, has left many small business owners who have stocked the brand for decades feeling devastated and confused. This move comes after the brand's popularity surged on social media, and it has sparked a significant backlash from customers who criticize the company for abandoning the very retailers that helped build its success.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an undocumented immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, is scheduled to be released on a $3,000 bond after spending 20 days in federal custody. His violent arrest by masked federal agents in Orange County, which was captured on video and went viral, sparked public outrage. His family expressed relief at the judge's decision but remains deeply concerned about the injuries he sustained during the beating, including a possible concussion, and plans to seek immediate medical care upon his release from the Adelanto detention facility.</p>

          <p>King Charles recently hosted his inaugural "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, an event that brought together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and activists to explore his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The gathering featured a ceremonial fire and discussions on the interconnectedness of all life, reflecting the King's long-held beliefs on sustainability, organic farming, and spirituality. The article positions this philosophy not as a mere hobby but as a central element of his worldview and a key component of the legacy he hopes to leave, bridging his environmental work with his deep personal faith.</p>

          <p>A proposal by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle Prague's iconic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge has ignited a fierce debate between modernization and preservation. Officials claim a new, wider bridge with a third track is essential for meeting future transportation demands and that the old structure is too corroded to safely upgrade. However, a coalition of architects, conservationists, and residents, backed by a 25,000-signature petition, argues that the historic bridge can be repaired and that its demolition would destroy a crucial part of Prague's skyline, proposing alternative solutions to expand capacity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has begun a major reorganization under the Trump administration, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees in a single day. The cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by about 15% and eliminate or merge numerous offices, including those focused on human rights, refugee assistance, and foreign aid. While the administration claims the move will streamline a bloated bureaucracy, critics, including Democratic senators and foreign service associations, warn that it will severely undermine American diplomacy and national security.</p>

          <p>A TUI flight traveling from Cancun, Mexico, to London had to be diverted to Bangor, Maine, after a physical fight broke out between two passengers. The mid-air altercation prompted an emergency landing, which subsequently required all 267 passengers to spend the night in Maine because the flight crew had exceeded their legally permitted work hours. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers removed the two disruptive individuals from the plane. While no criminal charges were filed, both were processed for expedited removal and sent to their home countries on separate flights.</p>

          <p>Actor Derek Dixon, who filed a $260 million lawsuit against producer and media mogul Tyler Perry, has spoken out for the first time, stating he "couldn't stay silent anymore."

Perry's attorney has vehemently denied the allegations, labeling them a "scam." Dixon says he hopes his public stand will help protect the next generation of creatives from having to choose between their dreams and their dignity.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit from the state, allowing the case alleging the platform harms children to move forward. The state's lawsuit claims that TikTok is intentionally designed with manipulative and addictive features aimed at exploiting its young user base to maximize engagement and advertising revenue. The attorney general praised the ruling as a crucial step toward holding the company accountable for its practices. This case is part of a growing legal trend where states are targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than user-generated content.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing growing scrutiny over his strategy for dealing with the United States after President Trump threatened a new 35% tariff on Canadian goods. Carney won his election on a promise to stand up to U.S. pressure, but recent concessions, such as abandoning a planned digital services tax, have not prevented further trade threats. While his government still holds strong public support, some political commentators and academics are questioning whether his approach is effective against an unpredictable U.S. administration, creating uncertainty for Canada's economy.</p>

The court's ruling sided with the Secretary of Defense, who had revoked the agreement by arguing that the victims' families and the American public deserve to see a full military trial.

Unlike other major chatbots that refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok complied, a behavior that seems to reflect Musk's goal of creating a non-"woke" AI.
