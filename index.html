          <p>Following the conviction of 59-year-old Ryan Routh for attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, his daughter had an emotional outburst in the courtroom. Routh was found guilty on all five criminal counts after representing himself and reportedly tried to harm himself with a pen before being restrained by U.S. Marshals. His daughter, Sara Routh, shouted profanities at the jury and later confronted the media outside, expressing her belief that the trial was rigged and her father was innocent. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to the airwaves after his show was suspended by ABC for nearly a week. The suspension followed controversial monologue comments regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Outside the Hollywood studio, both protesters calling for a longer suspension and supporters welcoming his return gathered, reflecting the polarized public reaction. The show's return was highly anticipated, as it marked Kimmel's first public address on the matter, while some major affiliate station owners planned to preempt the broadcast.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy admitted he was "a little bit" surprised by President Trump's sudden shift in position regarding the war with Russia. After meeting with Zelenskyy at the UN, Trump posted on social media that Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," calling the Russian military a "paper tiger." This statement marks a significant reversal from Trump's previous suggestions that a peace deal would likely involve Ukraine ceding some territory to Russia. Zelenskyy viewed the change as a positive development in their relationship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded its recall of frozen shrimp products due to potential contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. The latest recall involves three products from Seattle-based AquaStar, sold at Kroger-affiliated grocery stores across 31 states. This action is part of a larger investigation that began in August after the isotope was detected in a shipment from an Indonesian company. Although the frequent recalls are unusual, officials have stated that no illnesses have been reported and the system is working to prevent contaminated products from reaching consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service announced it has disrupted a massive, illegal telecommunications network in the New York area that posed a significant threat to city infrastructure and the UN General Assembly. Investigators seized over 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards from multiple locations, a setup powerful enough to disable cell towers or launch denial-of-service attacks. The network was reportedly used for encrypted communications by foreign governments, drug cartels, and organized crime rings. While the immediate threat has been neutralized, the investigation into those behind the well-funded operation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Despite moving away from a command economy, China has continued to use five-year plans as a central pillar of its macroeconomic policy for over seven decades. Since the first plan was implemented in 1953, these strategic blueprints have guided the nation's transformation from a country with limited industrial capacity into a global manufacturing powerhouse known as the "world's factory." Beijing is now using this framework to pursue its next goal: moving up the value chain to become a global leader in innovation and cutting-edge technology, with the upcoming 15th five-year plan expected to be crucial to this process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing as part of a broader push to phase out the practice in favor of alternatives. This move is supported by a coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan politicians but has sparked a fierce debate within the scientific and medical communities. While proponents celebrate the shift away from what they see as cruel and wasteful spending, some researchers and patient advocates express concern that eliminating animal models could hinder the development of life-saving drugs and therapies for complex diseases.</p>

          <p>In a major shift in his foreign policy stance, President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" from Russia. The statement, made on his Truth Social platform following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a stark reversal from his previous position that Ukraine would likely need to cede territory to achieve peace. Trump attributed his change in perspective to a new understanding of the economic pressure on Russia, which he labeled a "paper tiger," and urged Ukraine to act with the support of Europe.</p>

          <p>A GE Appliances plant in Louisville, Kentucky, has laid off nearly 150 workers, most of whom are Cuban immigrants, after their legal immigration status was abruptly revoked.

The move has created labor shortages at the plant, forcing remaining employees to work overtime, and has instilled fear among other immigrant workers whose Temporary Protected Status could also be at risk of being rescinded.</p>

          <p>President Trump's address at the United Nations General Assembly showcased a dramatic shift in his approach to global affairs during his second term. The speech was filled with grievances and outlined a transactional, unapologetically "America First" doctrine that prioritizes national sovereignty over international cooperation. This has left traditional allies scrambling to adjust to a new reality where the U.S. is less interested in leading the global order it helped build, weakening alliances and international institutions like the UN itself.

Critics accuse the government of a cover-up, as the investigation has not charged any government officials, despite the national intelligence service (EYP) also monitoring many of the same targets.

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a groundbreaking scholar of Chinese law who was instrumental in shaping global understanding of the country's legal system, has died at the age of 95. A professor emeritus at New York University's School of Law, Cohen began his career in the field in 1960 and was the first American to practice law in China under Communist rule. Over his six-decade career, he became a towering figure known for his influential writings on criminal procedure and international law, as well as his advocacy for Chinese dissidents and engagement with Beijing.</p>

          <p>In a parallel to the post-2020 election landscape, a wave of baseless conspiracy theories is spreading online, claiming that the 2024 presidential election was stolen from Kamala Harris. Election experts note that these theories use remarkably similar flawed logic and spurious statistical analyses as those used to claim the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. The claims, which include a fabricated NSA audit and misinterpretations of voting data, lack credible evidence and ignore the transparent, publicly audited processes that confirm the election's outcome, highlighting the persistent challenge of partisan misinformation.</p>

          <p>Leading American medical organizations have strongly condemned the Trump administration's recent claims linking Tylenol use during pregnancy and childhood vaccines to autism. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called the assertion about Tylenol "highly concerning" and "irresponsible," while the American Academy of Pediatrics labeled the vaccine claims "dangerous." Both groups emphasized that decades of robust scientific research have found no credible link in either case and warned that such misinformation threatens public health by creating unfounded fear and confusion for parents.</p>

          <p>A bill designed to lower the volume of loud commercials on streaming services has passed the California Legislature and now awaits the governor's signature. If signed into law, SB 576 would prohibit platforms like Hulu, Netflix, and Prime Video from playing advertisements at a volume significantly louder than the shows and movies they accompany. The legislation is modeled after the federal CALM Act, which already applies to broadcast and cable television. Industry groups, initially opposed, adopted a neutral stance after an amendment was added to prevent individuals from suing the streaming services directly for violations.</p>

          <p>Amid preparations for its 15th five-year plan, China is grappling with significant financial pressure at the local government level. To address cash shortages, some provincial authorities have begun aggressively clamping down on wealthy individuals, enforcing taxes on previously undeclared overseas income to generate revenue. This fiscal strain on local governments represents a major economic challenge for Beijing, and how to ensure their financial stability is expected to be a key consideration in the country's next long-term development blueprint.</p>

          <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is asking hundreds of federal employees who were laid off as part of a cost-cutting blitz to return to their jobs. This reversal comes after an aggressive downsizing campaign led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, which critics say left the agency broken, understaffed, and unable to perform basic functions, leading to costly mistakes. The rehiring effort at the GSA, which manages federal workplaces, mirrors similar moves at other agencies like the IRS and Labor Department, suggesting the administration's rapid job cuts went too far.</p>

The initiative, set to be a centerpiece of the upcoming COP30 climate summit, will invest in low-risk assets and use the returns to pay countries for maintaining their standing forests. Brazil's President Lula da Silva announced his country would contribute the first $1 billion, framing it as a critical investment in humanity's fight against climate change and urging other nations to join.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is adopting an aggressive new strategy focused on directly confronting Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party. At the party's recent conference, leader Sir Ed Davey made Farage a central theme of his speech, positioning the Lib Dems as the primary political antidote to Reform's rise. This approach aims to energize the party's base, attract moderate conservative voters alienated by Reform, and ensure the Liberal Democrats are not marginalized in an increasingly noisy and competitive political landscape.</p>

While Beijing frames the decision as an effort to protect marine biodiversity, the U.S. has sided with the Philippines, condemning it as a coercive attempt by China to advance its territorial claims under the guise of environmental conservation.</p>

The potential deal, which is said to be in its early stages, would involve new equity and comes as Tether makes strategic moves to expand its regulated business operations within the United States.
