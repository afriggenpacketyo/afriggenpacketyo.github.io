          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling a potential shift in British politics towards a more polarized, multiparty system. Sarah Pochin of Reform won by a mere six votes in Runcorn and Helsby, a traditionally Labour-held seat, highlighting voter frustration with both the Labour and Conservative parties. The victory was attributed to anti-incumbent sentiment fueled by economic dissatisfaction and immigration concerns, particularly regarding a local hotel housing migrants. The article also notes Reform's strong performance in municipal elections, potentially winning hundreds of seats, which could further disrupt the established political landscape. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, alleging left-wing bias in their news coverage.

The crowd, largely receptive, cheered at the scattershot injection of political issues, reflecting the current era where even graduation speeches are not immune to political polarization.
