          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 22:30:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, a significant political setback following a similar loss in the lower house. The defeat is attributed to public discontent over inflation, political scandals, and the rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which gained substantial support. Despite the loss, which historically leads to resignation, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to navigate critical trade negotiations with the United States. This marks the first time since 1955 that the Liberal Democratic Party has lost control of both houses.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating an intentional attack in Los Angeles where a driver rammed a car into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with at least seven in critical condition. Authorities state the driver made a U-turn before deliberately striking the group. After the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and attacked him; he was also shot by an unidentified suspect who fled the scene. The driver has since been booked for assault with a deadly weapon, and the shooting is being investigated as a separate crime.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited notorious drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias to the United States to face charges of cocaine distribution, conspiracy, and firearms smuggling. This is the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens. Macias, leader of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in January that led to a nationwide state of "internal armed conflict." His extradition marks a significant moment in Ecuador's struggle against organized crime, which has transformed the nation into a key hub for the global cocaine trade.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast appearance, former Nickelodeon star Drake Bell claimed that he and his co-stars do not receive residual payments for shows like "Drake & Josh," despite their continued popularity on streaming services and television reruns. Bell described this as a corrupt practice where a corporation makes billions from child labor while the actors receive only a one-time payment for their work. This allegation adds to the ongoing scrutiny of the network's treatment of its young talent, following revelations of abuse in the "Quiet on Set" documentary.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast in energy policy is emerging between the United States and China, particularly as global demand for electricity rises due to technologies like artificial intelligence. While China is aggressively pursuing renewable energy goals and increasing investments to gain a technological edge, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them as unreliable. This divergence in strategy highlights the different approaches the two global powers are taking to address both climate change and the increasing energy needs of the modern tech-driven economy.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, a number nearly three times higher than in the U.S. despite a smaller population. The surge has made Canada the only Western nation in the top 10 for measles outbreaks, with Alberta being the provincial hotspot. The spread is largely attributed to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities, and fueled by post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Health officials emphasize that increasing MMR vaccination coverage is the only effective way to contain the highly contagious virus.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to address warnings that future pensioners will be financially worse off than today's retirees. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, nearly half of working-age adults, especially the low-paid and self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. This savings gap could leave those retiring in 2050 with 8% less income per year. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on strategies to boost retirement savings, focusing on private pensions rather than the state pension system.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the initiative. The decline is linked to a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. While the president's base remains strongly supportive, Hispanic Americans' approval has dropped significantly. The poll also found that Americans want the administration to focus more on lowering prices, with seven in ten saying not enough is being done to address inflation.</p>

Insiders and analysts point to the UK's geography as a small, densely populated island, combined with a complex planning and political system, as major contributors to the project's spiraling costs. The initial ambition to build the world's fastest line drove up expenses, while political compromises and thousands of planning permissions added further delays and financial burdens, raising questions about the feasibility of large-scale infrastructure projects in the country.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the violent 1984 clash between police and miners at the Orgreave coking plant, a pivotal event during the year-long miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will address unanswered questions that have persisted for 40 years. It will examine the events of the day, which left over 100 people injured, and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations of falsified police evidence. The announcement fulfills a Labour manifesto promise and has been cautiously welcomed by justice campaigners.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler is being hailed as the most dominant force in men's golf since Tiger Woods in his prime. An analysis of his performance reveals a remarkable run, including four major championships and 13 PGA Tour wins since 2021. While Scheffler himself dismisses direct comparisons to Woods, his peers and sports commentators point to his machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments as 'Tiger-like.' Key to his recent success has been a significant improvement in his putting after working with a specialized coach and adopting a new grip.</p>

Critics, including congressional Democrats and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, warning it will cripple the EPA's ability to use science to protect public health and safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is 'self-connection'—the ability to understand one's own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all feelings, avoid micromanaging, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach is said to build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, states that American businesses are navigating a difficult environment in China, with ongoing tariff discussions dominating the bilateral relationship. He notes that while an extension of the current 90-day tariff pause is almost inevitable, the focus on tariffs overlooks broader operational challenges for companies. Stein suggests a potential path toward a more normal trade relationship could involve the U.S. reciprocating China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors by lowering some tariffs. However, the business community remains concerned about the narrow scope of current negotiations.</p>

Using a $300 million investment fund, the initiative provides upfront capital to finance projects, cutting down on the time and costs associated with traditional government-funded developments. Better Angels is currently bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to build hundreds of units faster and at a fraction of the typical cost.

          <p>The long-delayed 9/11 trials at Guantanamo Bay face further uncertainty after plea deals for the defendants, including alleged ringleader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were canceled. Legal experts suggest this development will lead to more litigation and prolong the dysfunctional pretrial process, which has already lasted for years. The deals would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for life sentences, offering a potential path to closure for some victims' families. With the plea agreements off the table, a trial still appears to be years away, leaving the ultimate outcome of the case in limbo.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from a medical episode after being violently pulled into a running MRI machine by a heavy metal chain he was wearing around his neck. The incident occurred at a Long Island medical facility when the man entered the MRI room, reportedly at the request of his wife who had just finished a scan. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the chain, causing the fatal event. This tragic accident underscores the strict safety protocols requiring the removal of all metal objects near MRI machines.</p>

The 18-year-old phenom, who was defeated in the first round of the same event last year, displayed formidable form with an impressive average of 108.92. Littler's comfortable win avoids the kind of upset that saw world number one Luke Humphries eliminated a day earlier.
