          <p>Israeli airstrikes in Iran have entered their fourth day, targeting command centers and military bases, with the stated aim of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Iranian media reports scores of people, including women and children, have been killed and hundreds wounded, with civilians struggling to find adequate shelter. Analysts suggest that the conflict has created an opportunity for fundamental political change in Iran, with opposition parties calling for renewed mass mobilization. As the likelihood of further strikes increases, economic experts warn of a potential currency crisis and mass unrest, and President Netanyahu has hinted that regime change could be a result of the conflict.</p>

The service will offer a $47.45-per-month plan with unlimited talk, text, and data, along with roadside assistance and telehealth benefits. This new venture capitalizes on the Trump brand, similar to other products like watches and sneakers. The website states that Trump Mobile is not designed, developed, manufactured, or sold by The Trump Organization, indicating a licensing agreement, which offers the Trump family lucrative opportunities to expand their visibility. Optimism score must be based on the fact that people are generally able to use cellphones. </p>

          <p>The stands of at least two major Israeli defense firms were blocked off at the Paris Air Show, which Israel claims was ordered by the French government due to a dispute over displays. Firms including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) had their pavilions blocked off, with boards placed around them. Israel's Defense Ministry stated that the organizers demanded the removal of offensive weapons systems from Israeli defense industry pavilions, which they rejected, and the conference staff responded by erecting black walls overnight. The ministry criticized the decision as policy-driven and commercially motivated, suggesting it was intended to exclude Israeli weapons that compete with French industries.</p>

          <p>Florida has removed a record 20 tons of invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades in an effort to curb their population, although experts concede they will likely never be completely eradicated. Biologists are focusing on finding and removing females during the breeding season, using tagged male ‚Äúscout‚Äù snakes with radio telemetry. The conservancy's efforts have prevented about 20,000 eggs from hatching since 2013, and the state is harnessing public fascination with pythons through events like the Florida python challenge to increase removals. Officials are optimistic that the python population can be greatly reduced, leading to a robust return of native animal populations.</p>

Belinda Taylor, 48, from Totnes, was one of two people who died at Dunkeswell Aerodrome, near Honiton, on Friday. Her partner Scott Armstrong said: "If she had ¬£10 in her purse and you needed ¬£10, you got it. She would put her own needs out of the way." Skydiving instructor Adam Harrison, 30, from Bournemouth, also died in the incident at the weekend.

The ads will be shown within WhatsApp's "Updates" tab to separate them from personal conversations, and Meta will also monetize WhatsApp's Channels feature through search ads and subscriptions. This move represents a key step in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plans to make WhatsApp a significant part of the company's business strategy, as the app boasts over 3 billion monthly users.</p>

The work capability assessment will be scrapped in 2028, and eligibility for Pip will be tightened, requiring claimants to prove they need a higher degree of assistance. Up to 1.3 million people across England and Wales could lose at least some support under the changes, and the welfare package could push an extra 250,000 people into relative poverty.

          <p>U.S. Steel shares have risen after President Donald Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent on a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with all regulatory approvals now received and the transaction expected to be completed promptly (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Asian needle ant, an insect with a potent bite, continues its march across the US, prompting entomologists to raise public awareness about the risks it poses. While not aggressive, the ant's sting can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals, leading to increased hospitalizations. The ants colonize undisturbed forest areas and can also be found near homes and businesses, disrupting natural ecosystems. Entomologists encourage people to identify suspected Asian needle ants and take precautions, but also note that the ants are not overly dangerous and only a small percentage of people stung experience anaphylaxis.</p>

Public transit ridership has increased, and bus routes through Manhattan are moving up to 20 percent faster, but the policy faces opposition from conservatives and is threatened by the Trump administration.

          <p>Scientists in Hawaii are dropping live mosquitoes from drones to combat avian malaria, a mosquito-borne disease threatening the state's endangered forest birds. The mosquitoes are all males that have been reared in a lab and contain a strain of bacteria called wolbachia, which interferes with reproduction. When these males mate with females in the area, their eggs fail to hatch, thus suppressing the spread of disease. Since late 2023, millions of male mosquitoes have been released across Maui and Kauai, and scientists are now testing drones as a safer and more efficient alternative to helicopters.</p>
