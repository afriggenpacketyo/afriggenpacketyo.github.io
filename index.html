          <p>Five police officers in Chiapas, Mexico, were killed in an ambush by an armed group, prompting the deployment of over 1,000 officers to the area. The attack occurred in Frontera Comalapa, a town bordering Guatemala, amidst a turf war between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation cartel. Authorities arrested a suspect found near the crime scene with an AK-47 rifle and military uniforms. The region has been described as a major smuggling hub for drugs and migrants, with a history of violence, including the recovery of over 30 bodies from pits in December.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on his social media platform, X. Musk expressed concerns that the bill would significantly increase the federal budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with unsustainable debt. The White House dismissed Musk's criticism, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt affirming the President's support for the bill. This criticism comes after Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE effort to reduce government spending.</p>

          <p>With above-normal temperatures expected this summer, Americans are bracing for high electricity bills, projected to reach a 12-year high of $784. Lower-income households will be disproportionately affected, with many already struggling to pay their energy bills. Experts recommend using fans, setting AC temperatures between 70°F and 78°F when home and 78°F when away, and regularly changing AC filters. Additional tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, limiting oven use, and unplugging unused appliances, while utility companies and state governments offer programs and financial assistance to help reduce energy costs.</p>

          <p>British police are re-examining 287 child sexual exploitation cases that were previously dropped, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. These cases have been handed to a national police taskforce for review, with the possibility of reopening them and pursuing new lines of inquiry. The review was initiated after Cooper requested all police forces in England and Wales to reassess historic gang exploitation cases where 'No Further Action' was taken. Half of the police forces have reported back so far, identifying these cases for further scrutiny.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece defends Elon Musk as a visionary who, despite recent setbacks and criticisms, remains focused on his long-term goals, particularly space exploration. Musk's ambition to colonize Mars is driven by his belief that humanity must become a multi-planet civilization to survive the eventual destruction of Earth by the sun. The article argues that Musk's space program continues to be successful, launching significantly more tonnage into space than the rest of the world combined. It suggests that his political interventions may ultimately benefit his space ventures, highlighting his ability to profit from his ideological pursuits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially reversing decades-old U.S. immigration policy. The proposal would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a difficult timeframe given current backlogs. Even if met, asylum seekers would need to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit, instead of six months. Advocates fear this could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and drive them to work illegally.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is facing criticism for potentially rolling back parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), leading to millions losing Medicaid coverage and health insurance. Critics argue the bill reduces "waste, fraud, and abuse" in Medicaid and other government health programs, but Democrats frame it as an assault on healthcare. The bill would leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034 and makes several ACA changes, including shortening the open enrollment period and creating new paperwork hurdles. These changes are projected to reduce federal spending on Medicaid by about $700 billion over 10 years.</p>

          <p>German customs reported a significant increase in processed items in 2024, largely driven by e-commerce, with 90% of online deliveries originating from China. The customs office handled 235 million online deliveries in 2024, more than four times the previous year's total. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil noted that more cheap goods and counterfeit products are entering Germany from China. Discussions are underway to potentially abolish the €150 tariff limit to address the influx of these items, and the European Commission has proposed a flat fee on packages from China.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook expressed concerns that recent progress on inflation could be reversed due to the impact of tariffs on the economy. She also noted that President Trump's trade policies could negatively affect the labor market. Cook acknowledged that while core and headline inflation have shown improvement, price increases tied to trade policy may hinder further progress. The Fed is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting in two weeks, with expectations of maintaining current interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia presented Ukraine with a memorandum outlining its conditions for a ceasefire and a comprehensive peace treaty, which includes maximalist demands seen as nonstarters by Kyiv and its Western allies. Moscow's conditions include recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea and other regions, Ukraine's neutral status, and limits on its armed forces. Ukraine has reaffirmed its refusal to abandon its NATO bid or acknowledge Russia's territorial gains, setting up mutually exclusive red lines that make a quick deal unlikely.

          <p>The UK government is facing criticism for suggesting that good weather is a primary factor behind the record number of small boat crossings. The Home Office released figures showing a peak in "red days" (days favorable for crossings) and an increase in overcrowded boats. Critics accuse the government of "blaming the weather" for the crossings, while the government maintains it is working to fix a broken asylum system. Experts note that while weather is a factor, the effectiveness of smuggling gangs and the number of people wanting to reach the UK are likely more significant.</p>

          <p>The collapse of Switzerland's Birch glacier has largely destroyed the village of Blatten, burying it under millions of cubic meters of rock and ice debris. Residents were evacuated in time, though one life is thought to have been lost, and the site remains too unstable for crews to access. Experts attribute the collapse to a combination of factors, including rising temperatures, melting permafrost, and unstable geology, with climate change increasing the frequency of such natural hazards.
