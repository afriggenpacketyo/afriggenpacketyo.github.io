          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 35% on Japanese goods if a new trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This potential increase significantly exceeds the current 10% levy and the 24% initially proposed, signaling a hardline stance in negotiations. President Trump has expressed doubt about reaching a deal, while Japan has remained firm, stating it will not make concessions that harm its agricultural sector, particularly concerning US rice imports. The move is part of a broader, aggressive trade policy that has seen few new agreements finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The payment, which will be directed to Trump's future presidential library and includes his legal fees, resolves the dispute without an apology from Paramount. The company's decision to settle, rather than fight a costly legal battle, is seen as a move to clear the way for its sale to Skydance Media, which requires FCC approval. As part of the deal, "60 Minutes" will release transcripts of future interviews with presidential candidates.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The decision blocks a plan by the Department of Homeland Security to end the program in September, well before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge stated that the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before the existing extension period ends. This ruling provides temporary relief for Haitians who rely on the status for legal residency and work permits, though the White House has announced it will appeal.</p>

          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a pivotal figure in shaping the cultural landscape of Los Angeles, has passed away at the age of 105. A decorated WWII veteran, attorney, and real estate developer, Nicholas was instrumental in the creation of major institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Known as "Mr. Downtown Culture," he also founded Public Counsel in 1970, now the nation's largest pro bono law firm, to provide legal aid to the vulnerable.

          <p>President Trump, accompanied by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, toured a newly constructed migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The remote facility, built to support the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, is surrounded by treacherous swampland. Trump praised its rapid construction and noted the alligators as unpaid "bodyguards," emphasizing that the only way out is deportation. The center, which can house up to 3,000 people, is part of a broader plan to establish similar facilities nationwide to accelerate the deportation of undocumented migrants.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants apprehended for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border unlawfully reached a new historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 recorded apprehensions. This continues an unprecedented decline in illegal immigration that the Trump administration credits to its aggressive enforcement and deportation policies. For a second consecutive month, no migrants were reportedly released into the U.S. These figures stand in sharp contrast to previous years, which saw daily crossings sometimes exceed this new monthly total. The administration's tactics include swift deportations, military-built barriers, and a campaign encouraging self-deportation.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price has dropped by 7% in recent days, a decline linked to a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over a major spending bill. Musk criticized the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," arguing it would increase the national debt and harm renewable energy by cutting EV tax credits. Trump retorted that Musk was upset about losing subsidies and could "lose a lot more." This dispute adds pressure on Tesla, as analysts already forecast a 13% year-over-year decline in its second-quarter vehicle deliveries, and the company relies heavily on government-derived regulatory credits.

However, it also proposes deep cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid and has been criticized for potentially adding $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

Critics argue this action creates a climate of fear, deterring people from seeking essential medical care.

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has filed for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." The filing reveals strong growth, with a 46% increase in first-quarter revenue to $228.2 million and a net income of $44.9 million. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles. CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public is intended to allow the community to share in the company's ownership and signals plans to make significant acquisitions in the future.
