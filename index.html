          <p>McDonald's has surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for earnings and revenue, leading to a rise in its stock price. The fast-food giant's success is attributed to popular promotional campaigns, including a collaboration with the "Minecraft" movie, which helped reverse a trend of declining U.S. sales. Same-store sales saw their most significant increase in nearly two years, with international markets like Japan and the U.K. also showing robust growth. This performance indicates a strong consumer response to the company's value offerings and new menu items, signaling a positive rebound in its domestic market.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for three hours to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. The meeting occurs as a deadline from President Trump approaches, threatening significant sanctions against Russia if it fails to take steps to end the war. Despite the high-level talks, expectations for a settlement by the Friday deadline remain low, as Russia continues its aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities. The U.S. has also recently approved an additional $200 million in military sales to Ukraine, highlighting the complex blend of diplomatic and military pressure being applied to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Kelley Mack, an actress recognized for her roles in “The Walking Dead” and “Chicago Med,” has passed away at the age of 33. Her family announced that she died after a battle with glioma, a rare and aggressive form of central nervous system cancer, which she was diagnosed with earlier in the year. Mack had a diverse career as an actor, producer, writer, and voiceover artist, notably voicing Gwen Stacy in “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” Her family described her as a “bright, fervent light” and plans to hold remembrance services in both Ohio and Los Angeles to honor her life and career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) present more affordable borrowing options compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of early August 2025, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.41%, while HELOCs average 8.26%. These financial products offer lower interest rates and potential tax deductions if the funds are used for eligible home improvements. However, since the home serves as collateral, it is crucial for homeowners to carefully consider the terms and their ability to make payments to avoid the risk of foreclosure.

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the benefit of locking in high rates. While national average yields for CDs are modest, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some 1-year CDs reaching 4.40% APY. The article advises savers to look at online banks, which typically offer better rates due to lower overhead, and to consider short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher returns than long-term options. Laddering CDs is suggested as a strategy to maximize these high short-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>

She stated on social media that her father disliked the morbidity of funerals and that she chose to honor him in a more personal and genuine way by spending time at the beach with her family. This decision comes after a period of estrangement from her father, who passed away at 71 from a heart attack. While close friends and family, including WWE figures, gathered at a church for the service, Brooke chose a private tribute, reflecting on their shared love for the ocean.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market, this article details the current average interest rates for mortgages and refinancing as of early August 2025. A 30-year fixed mortgage averages 6.78%, while a 15-year loan is around 6.00%, with refinance rates slightly higher. To secure the best possible rate, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and to shop around among different lenders. The piece also notes that while rates are high, they may stabilize or decrease if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes, offering potential relief for homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is also supported by offloading Marcus Rashford's full salary in a loan deal and receiving payments from sell-on clauses for former players. While co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe had warned of financial strain, the club's commercial power and strategic player sales are enabling a significant £200 million refurbishment of its attacking lineup.</p>

          <p>Powered by People, a political action committee led by former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, is providing key financial support to Texas House Democrats who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. The group is helping cover upfront costs like lodging and transportation for the lawmakers, who are aiming to prevent a quorum and halt the passage of what they consider a rigged congressional map. O'Rourke has been in regular contact with the caucus and has pledged his full support, using his national platform to fundraise for the effort. This assistance is crucial as the Democrats face threats of arrest and daily fines for their absence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential elimination of the EPA's Energy Star program, reportedly part of the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts, could have significant consequences for the commercial real estate industry. Landlords and developers rely on the program's Portfolio Manager software to track energy usage, comply with state and local climate policies, and identify buildings needing efficiency upgrades. The tool supports billions in energy cost savings and is the backbone for numerous municipal regulations. Industry groups fear that defunding the program would remove a critical data infrastructure, and privatizing it could lead to a costly, fee-based system, disrupting established energy efficiency efforts.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the construction of a $15.5 billion bridge to connect Sicily with the mainland, a project that would create the world's longest suspension bridge. Revived by Premier Giorgia Meloni's administration, the nearly 3.7-kilometer span across the Strait of Messina is championed as a driver of development and jobs for southern Italy. However, the project remains highly controversial, facing opposition over its environmental impact on migratory birds, its location in a seismically active area, and the persistent threat of mafia interference in large-scale infrastructure projects. Preliminary work is expected to begin this summer.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new series of "MasterChef" that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following an investigation into their conduct. The decision to broadcast the series has drawn criticism, with some of the women who made complaints and former contestants suggesting it should have been axed or refilmed. The BBC defended its choice, stating it was fair to the contestants who participated, but the episodes appear to be edited to minimize the hosts' banter. The controversy stems from a report that upheld numerous complaints against Wallace and a separate complaint against Torode.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must raise taxes to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in the public finances. The think tank states that without a "moderate but sustained increase in taxes," the government will fail to meet its self-imposed borrowing rules. This budget gap is attributed to weakening economic growth and the watering down of planned welfare cuts. Niesr suggests that the government faces a difficult choice between its spending commitments, manifesto tax promises, and fiscal rules, with potential tax hikes on VAT or income tax thresholds being necessary.

          <p>A lawsuit with the potential for billions in compensation has been launched against FIFA and several national football associations by the Dutch foundation Justice for Players (JFP). The case follows a European Court of Justice ruling that found FIFA's transfer rules impede the free movement of players within the EU. JFP argues that these rules have unfairly diminished players' negotiating power and earnings for over two decades. If successful, the lawsuit could fundamentally alter the football labor market, potentially reducing or eliminating transfer fees and shifting power further towards players, similar to the landmark 1995 Bosman ruling.</p>

          <p>China is on the verge of completing a merger between its two largest state-owned shipbuilders, creating the world's largest publicly listed shipbuilding company. The new entity, CSSC Holdings, will have assets exceeding $55 billion and is seen as a strategic move to optimize resources and bolster China's industrial and military ambitions. Analysts note that the merger aims to enhance global competitiveness by phasing out less efficient operations and focusing on high-end vessel construction. This consolidation occurs as China positions itself as a major rival to the United States in multiple strategic sectors, including maritime and defense industries.</p>

          <p>In an adapted excerpt from his memoir, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich reflects on the state of American democracy and the economy. He attributes the rise of political figures like Donald Trump to decades of rising inequality, where economic gains have disproportionately favored the wealthy while the working class has stagnated. Reich criticizes both political parties for abandoning working-class interests in favor of corporate and financial power, which he argues has fueled public anger and powerlessness. Despite his grim assessment of the present, Reich concludes with a declaration of his love for America and a dogged sense of hope for its long-term future.</p>

This move follows a similar unilateral visa-free policy from Beijing for South Korean travelers, which has already led to a significant increase in travel to China.

The article highlights the success of a USAID-funded program in Mozambique, where a man used a $1,000 grant to build a life-changing barbershop. Despite growing evidence that cash transfers are an effective and efficient form of aid, the administration has signaled a move away from the model, citing concerns about misuse.
