          <p>Orsted's shares plummeted over 25% after the wind farm developer announced a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue. This significant financial move comes in response to a "material adverse development" in the U.S. market, which hindered the company's ability to secure funds from a planned partial divestment of its Sunrise Wind project near New York. The rights issue will grant existing shareholders the opportunity to purchase new shares. This strategy aims to bolster the company's financial position amidst its challenges in the American energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cherry tomato-sized fireball that pierced a metro Atlanta home in June has been identified as a 4.56-billion-year-old meteorite, predating Earth's formation by 20 million years. University of Georgia planetary geologist Scott Harris confirmed the space rock's age after examining fragments. The meteorite is believed to have originated from a larger asteroid that broke apart 470 million years ago. This discovery, named the McDonough Meteorite, is the 27th recovered in Georgia's history and highlights the importance of analyzing such space rocks for understanding potential asteroid threats.</p>

          <p>Radical changes to driving laws in England and Wales are being considered, including compulsory eye tests every three years for motorists over 70 when renewing their licenses. This initiative follows a coroner's call for action after four deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight, highlighting the UK's "laxest" licensing system in Europe. Other proposals include lowering the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's and introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers. The government aims to publish a new road safety strategy this autumn to reduce road deaths and injuries.</p>

          <p>The extension of the U.S.-China tariff truce remains undecided as its Tuesday expiry approaches, despite Beijing's initial optimism for a 90-day renewal. Tensions persist over issues like fentanyl, existing tariffs, and semiconductor export controls, with both nations' trade volumes significantly impacted. While a Trump-Xi summit is anticipated, experts suggest a structural move towards decoupling rather than a friendlier relationship. China's increased soybean purchases and relaxed rare-earth export bans offer some positive signs, yet new U.S. tariffs on Russian crude purchases by China pose further complications.

          <p>Global uncertainties are driving a surge of Chinese gold miners into African goldfields, particularly in Mali, despite escalating security risks. The Chinese embassy in Mali has repeatedly warned its citizens and ordered mining companies to halt operations and evacuate due to worsening security, including recent kidnappings and attacks targeting Chinese nationals. This rush underscores the allure of gold as a safe-haven asset amidst geopolitical instability, yet highlights the significant dangers faced by those pursuing it in volatile regions.

          <h2>Perseids Meteor Shower Peaks This Week, but Bright Moon May Obscure Visibility</h2>

          <p>The Perseids meteor shower, renowned as one of the best celestial displays, is set to peak this week, specifically early Wednesday for North America. However, a bright, 84% full moon will significantly compromise visibility, reducing the expected hourly meteor count by at least 75%. Viewers can anticipate seeing 10-20 Perseids per hour, a decrease from the usual 50 under darker conditions. NASA advises early morning viewing in dark, rural areas. The meteors originate from debris left by comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle.</p>

          <p>The article dissects the contentious medical evidence in the Lucy Letby case, where she was convicted of murdering and attempting to murder infants. It highlights claims by her defense barrister, Mark McDonald, and his expert panel, who argue the prosecution's medical case is unreliable, citing issues with liver injury interpretations and air embolism theories. Conversely, the article also points out inconsistencies and contested claims within the defense's arguments, such as the "needle theory" and "birth trauma." The Criminal Cases Review Commission is now evaluating the new expert reports.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has labeled Nvidia’s H20 AI chip as unsafe, urging a boycott due to alleged "back-door" vulnerabilities, despite Nvidia's denials. The outlet, Yuyuan Tantian, linked to China Central Television, claims the chips could be remotely controlled, citing historical U.S. surveillance attempts and a recent bill proposing tracking features in U.S. chips. This growing distrust comes as Nvidia and AMD recently agreed to pay 15% of their China AI chip sales revenue to the U.S. government, intensifying tech trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Children share memories, engage in group therapy, and express emotions through art, often searching Russian social media for information despite violent content. The camp provides a vital space for these children to heal, play, and connect with others sharing similar experiences.</p>

This expansion comes as Tesla faces a sales slump for its EVs across Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

The deployment, which involved reassigning over 120 FBI agents, caused confusion among residents, while some homeless individuals expressed fear over potential displacement, highlighting concerns about the federal government's approach to social issues.</p>

His administration, a coalition with the Social Democrats, struggled from its inception, marked by a symbolic initial failure to secure chancellorship. Merz is navigating a polarized political landscape, accused of both leftward concessions and far-right leanings, while the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) gains ground. Despite the negativity, the article suggests the coalition's shared interest in success and the AfD's internal issues might offer Merz a path forward.</p>

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the aim is to prevent criminals from "exploiting our immigration system" and "fast-track" removals.
