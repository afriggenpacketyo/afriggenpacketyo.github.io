          <p>For the fourth consecutive night, Northern Ireland experienced unrest, this time in Portadown, County Armagh, where a crowd threw bricks and masonry at police officers. The disturbances followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena. Police issued warnings and maintained a heavy presence, while a police helicopter monitored the town center, and firefighters extinguished several fires. A local political leader called for calm, emphasizing the undesirability of violence, while a housing association advised residents to safeguard their properties. The events in Ballymena, which previously saw significant violence, were relatively calm. The anti-racism protest in west Belfast remained peaceful. The Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland described the violence as "racist thuggery" targeted at ethnic minorities and law enforcement. The community is now working to find safe places for families. </p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference in Los Angeles was disrupted by Democratic Senator Alex Padilla, leading to his forcible removal from the event. Padilla interrupted Noem while she criticized California's leadership on immigration, attempting to ask questions before being escorted out, after which he claims he was forced to the ground and handcuffed. Noem stated that Padilla did not request a meeting and his actions were inappropriate. Padilla explained that he sought information about DHS's immigration enforcement actions and was denied answers, which led to his actions. California lawmakers have expressed outrage, while DHS officials claimed Padilla did not identify himself properly and resisted officers. Noem and Padilla met for 15 minutes following the incident.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing for potential escalation in the Middle East as Israel considers military action against Iran's nuclear facilities. President Trump has sent mixed signals regarding his stance on an Israeli strike while the U.S. continues diplomatic efforts with Tehran. The State Department issued a security alert for Americans in the Middle East and North Africa. Negotiations with Iran are ongoing but have hit a wall over uranium enrichment. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad has issued a partial evacuation order, and military dependents are being allowed to depart from locations across the Middle East, indicating heightened concerns about regional instability.</p>

          <p>NPR's "Consider This" podcast delves into the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who has become a symbol of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was arrested by ICE agents and accused of being an MS-13 gang member, allegations his family denies. Despite a protective order, he was deported to a supermax prison in El Salvador. However, federal courts intervened, ordering his return to the U.S. The podcast explores the legal and political ramifications of Abrego Garcia's case, focusing on his return to the United States and what could happen next. The case highlights the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement and the subsequent legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is reviewing the legality of President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to assist with immigration enforcement. The judge questioned the Justice Department about the president's authority to federalize the National Guard in response to civil unrest. California sued the Trump administration, arguing that the president unlawfully bypassed the governor when calling the National Guard into service. The Trump administration contends that the president has the authority to deploy troops to protect federal employees and property, while California officials argue that the military's presence destabilizes the community.</p>

Tom Homan, President Trump's chief advisor on border policy, stated that the administration is not satisfied with the current deportation numbers and aims to increase them. The government is also appealing to the public for assistance in locating and deporting individuals in the country without authorization.

          <p>The Trump administration has begun sending termination notices to approximately 500,000 foreign nationals who had received temporary stays to live and work in the United States under the CHNV program. Recipients are encouraged to "self-deport immediately" and will receive travel assistance and a $1,000 bonus upon arrival in their home country if they use DHS's Home Mobile App. This action follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing DHS to order CHNV participants to leave the country. The CHNV program granted temporary stays to individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela due to conflicts or unsafe conditions in their home countries.</p>

          <p>Michael Johnson has canceled the final leg of the Grand Slam Track series in Los Angeles, leaving the city without a major track meeting this summer. The decision follows USA Track and Field's removal of the LA Grand Prix from the calendar. Economic problems with the venue are cited as the reason for the cancellation, with the league looking towards 2026 and new investors. The news is a setback for Olympic and track leaders as they prepare for the Summer Games in the United States. USATF is seeking alternative meetings for athletes needing to qualify for world championships.</p>

Critics argue the funds could be better allocated to military families' needs or medical defense research. The parade, costing between $25 million and $45 million, includes thousands of troops, tanks, and aircraft. Trump defends the parade as a celebration of the country and military strength. Protests against the administration's immigration policies are planned to counterprogram the parade, with the main protest titled "No Kings."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed support for Chinese students in the United States, pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This statement contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration aimed at limiting or blocking international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized the benefits Chinese students bring to American schools and the country. He also supported allowing them to be hired by American companies, suggesting that if they are not allowed to stay, they will return to their countries and start businesses there. Trump's stance marks a notable shift in his administration's approach to Chinese students.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's approach to China is based on a misdiagnosis of the issues, hindering effective solutions. The author notes that while a US-China trade truce and a "framework" agreement have been reached, there is little room for optimism without a reorientation of Washington's trade and foreign policy thinking. China's tightening of rare earth exports demonstrated its ability to retaliate, prompting Trump to engage in negotiations. The London talks may have de-escalated tensions, but a fundamental shift in Washington's approach is necessary for lasting progress.</p>
