          <p>The remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed during an attack on a remote mountain outpost in Laos in 1968, have been officially identified. Hall was one of eleven servicemen whose bodies could not be recovered after their unit was overrun by Vietnamese commandos. After decades of recovery efforts, which included using dummies to trace body trajectories down the mountain, joint U.S.-Laos teams found remains earlier this year. Advanced DNA and anthropological analysis confirmed the identity, bringing long-awaited closure to his family, who will bury him in Kansas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new trade deal with the Philippines following a meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. According to a post on Truth Social, the agreement establishes a 19% tariff on products imported from the Philippines, while the Philippines will eliminate all tariffs on U.S. goods. The deal, which also includes military cooperation, was reached ahead of the Trump administration's August 1 deadline for countries to secure trade agreements or face higher tariffs. The Philippine government has not yet formally confirmed the details of the agreement.</p>

          <p>A housing policy expert from the Manhattan Institute argues that New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposed rent freeze would exacerbate the city's housing crisis. The expert, John Ketcham, told Fox News that the core issue is a lack of housing supply, which Mamdani's policies fail to address. He contends that freezing rents on stabilized units would deter investment, leading to a rapid deterioration in housing quality as owners struggle to cover maintenance costs. Ketcham believes the focus should be on encouraging private sector construction to create an abundance of new housing.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced plans to introduce a version of its classic cola in the U.S. sweetened with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's approach to Ukraine is inconsistent and ultimately undermines the country's war effort against Russia. While the administration recently approved a transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems, it simultaneously gave Russia a 50-day period to negotiate before facing new sanctions, effectively allowing Moscow to continue its bombing campaigns. The analysis suggests that Trump is stringing Ukraine along, offering just enough support to create an appearance of help without providing the decisive aid needed for victory, leaving Ukraine in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has announced a pilot program to increase the security allowance for members of Congress in response to a rising number of threats. The program will provide an additional $20,000 for residential security and $5,000 for monitoring services through the end of the fiscal year. This decision follows several violent incidents, including the recent shooting death of a congressional intern and attacks on two Minnesota state lawmakers. The speaker cited an "enhanced threat environment" as the reason for bolstering security measures for lawmakers and their families.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is moving forward with a policy to ban people from living in recreational vehicles by imposing strict citywide parking limits. Mayor Daniel Lurie supports the measure as necessary to clear sidewalks and reduce trash, stating the city has a duty to provide indoor shelter solutions. However, critics argue the plan is cruel, as it will displace hundreds of people, including families, without guaranteeing sufficient alternative housing. The policy includes a permit program for some current residents, but many worry it will lead to people losing their only form of shelter.</p>

          <p>After losing her tongue and voice box to oral cancer, Sonya Sotinsky has regained her ability to speak using a custom artificial intelligence voice clone. Before her surgery, she recorded hours of herself speaking, including reading children's books and cursing, to capture her unique personality and accent. An AI company used these recordings to build an exact replica, which she now uses through a text-to-speech app. The technology has allowed her to reclaim her identity and "sass," and she is now advocating for better insurance coverage for such life-changing assistive technologies.</p>

          <p>The cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' by CBS is a significant blow to the late-night television landscape, according to this analysis in The Guardian. While CBS cites financial reasons, with the show reportedly losing millions annually, the timing is suspicious, coming just after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount for a settlement with Donald Trump. The article suggests the decision may be a convenient sacrifice to protect a multi-billion dollar merger. It laments the loss of Colbert's voice, which provided a crucial, morally clear critique of the Trump administration.</p>

Harrods has also taken legal action to replace the executors of Fayed's estate, citing a lack of progress in resolving his affairs and aiming to protect assets for potential claimants.

          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old athlete and avid Peloton user, has successfully campaigned for the fitness company to add new age brackets for its oldest riders.

In response, Peloton has now added 90-plus and 100-plus categories. Dorion, a veteran of roughly 250 marathons and triathlons, said her persistence was driven by a belief in doing the right thing and never giving up.</p>

The reader, despite knowing it's just a game, ruminates on mistakes and feels despair after a loss. Parker advises against trying to become a "good loser," suggesting that losing is a fundamentally negative experience. Instead, he recommends focusing one's energy on the comeback, embracing the human capacity for renewal and bouncing back with elasticity after absorbing the sting of defeat.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that a growing majority of retirees substantially rely on Social Security for their income, even as public confidence in the program's future wanes. About two-thirds of retirees now indicate a heavy reliance on their monthly checks, up from about half in 2005. This comes as the program faces challenges, including a potential funding shortfall by 2034. The survey underscores a critical paradox: as the retirement program becomes more vital to more people, worries about its long-term stability and ability to provide adequate benefits are increasing.</p>
