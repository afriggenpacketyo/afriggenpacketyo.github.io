          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of the data company Astronomer, has resigned from his position following a widely circulated video from a Coldplay concert. The footage showed Byron in an intimate moment with the company's chief people officer, Kristin Cabot, before they both attempted to hide from the camera. The company stated that its leaders are expected to meet a standard of conduct that was not met in this instance. The resignation came after the company launched a formal investigation and placed Byron on administrative leave.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in Westbury, New York, after being pulled into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. According to the Nassau County Police Department, the man was wearing a large metallic chain when he entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field forcefully drew him in, causing a fatal medical episode. The incident is currently under investigation and highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI equipment, which can turn magnetic objects into dangerous projectiles.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly, strongly considering" bringing back veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. At 40 years old, Paul remains a productive player and previously led the team during its "Lob City" era. The potential signing is part of the Clippers' strategy to add more playmaking and ball-handling depth to the roster to support stars like James Harden. Frank emphasized that any new player would need to accept a reserve role, acknowledging the team's focus on building a versatile roster.</p>

The heavy rainfall follows a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing the likelihood of flooding.

          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club. The move, likely a loan with an option to buy, comes as a surprise to some, but aligns with Barcelona's summer priority of strengthening its left-wing attack after other targets fell through. For Barcelona, the deal represents a low-risk opportunity to acquire a talented player with extensive top-level experience who could be a major asset if he rediscovers his best form. The transfer reflects both Rashford's need for a fresh start and Barcelona's creative approach to its finances.</p>

          <h2>Bank of America Analysts Compare Quantum Computing's Potential to the Discovery of Fire</h2>

          <p>A recent report from Bank of America analysts suggests that quantum computing could be the most significant technological revolution for humanity since the discovery of fire. The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, has the theoretical potential to solve endless complex calculations instantly, which could rapidly accelerate human knowledge. While major milestones have been achieved, a quantum computer has yet to solve a useful, real-world problem faster than a classical one due to the instability of qubits. The report also notes that AI could help speed up quantum development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently released air-to-air photographs of two Shenyang J-35 fighters suggest the aircraft may have entered low-rate initial production for the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The jets are shown with production-style serial numbers and new shark markings, similar to those on other active naval aircraft. This development indicates that China's next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter is advancing rapidly towards operational status. The J-35 is expected to significantly enhance the capabilities of China's growing aircraft carrier fleet.</p>

          <p>On the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, this article reflects on the plot known as "Operation Valkyrie." Led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg, the coup by conservative military and civil officials ultimately failed, but it has become an enduring symbol of German resistance to the Nazi regime. The historical memory of the event has evolved, with initial post-war condemnation of the plotters later shifting to heroic commemoration. Historians note the plotters were not necessarily democrats but acted late in the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized those calling for the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files as "troublemakers and radical left lunatics," even as he ordered the Justice Department to seek their disclosure. In a social media post, he claimed that nothing would satisfy those making the request. This follows the DOJ's formal filing to unseal grand jury testimony from the case, citing significant public interest. A former federal prosecutor noted that the release of grand jury transcripts may not reveal much new information.</p>

          <p>The owner of Impact Plastics, a Tennessee factory where six workers died in floodwaters from Hurricane Helene last year, will not face criminal charges. The District Attorney announced the decision after a state investigation found no evidence that employees were forced to stay or threatened with termination if they left. The investigation concluded that workers had over an hour to evacuate via makeshift routes. While the criminal case is closed, the company still faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of one victim, with more civil suits planned.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating a link between a deadly explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's training facility and explosives recovered from a Santa Monica apartment. The blast on Friday killed three deputies who were handling explosive materials. A day earlier, the same deputies had responded to a call at the apartment, where a grenade was found in a storage unit. The investigation, now led by federal agencies, is trying to determine if the materials from the apartment were the ones involved in the fatal explosion.</p>

          <p>The defense team for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, claims that prosecutors illegally obtained his confidential medical records. His attorneys allege the Manhattan District Attorney's office used a "fraudulent subpoena" to compel Aetna to turn over the information, violating health privacy laws like HIPAA. They are requesting a hearing and sanctions, which could include dismissal of the charges. Prosecutors reportedly state they received the additional materials in error from Aetna and deleted them upon realizing the mistake.</p>
