          <p>Defense industry leaders believe technology is now sufficient to create a space-based missile defense system, encompassing the entire US.  The 'Golden Dome' project, ordered by President Trump, would involve a layered defense system of radars, interceptors, and lasers, but faces significant organizational and technological hurdles.  Deployment could begin as early as 2026, focusing initially on major cities and military sites before expanding nationwide.</p>

          <h2>Declining Birth Rates Globally: The Role of Technology and Singledom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-23 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global birth rates are declining, challenging existing theories focusing solely on economics or women's empowerment.  Social scientist Alice Evans suggests a correlation between the rise of singledom and declining fertility, attributing this to increased access to hyper-engaging online entertainment.  Evans proposes addressing this by fostering social skills and community building to encourage couple formation.</p>
