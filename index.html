        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for Donald Trump, to a lifetime position on a federal appeals court in a narrow 50-49 vote. The confirmation was highly contentious, with Democrats unanimously opposing the nomination, citing concerns about his loyalty to the former president over the law. The article notes that Bove faced accusations from whistleblowers of misconduct during his time at the Department of Justice, which he has denied. His appointment to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals is seen as one of Trump's most controversial judicial picks.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes substantial steps to end the war in Gaza and agrees to a ceasefire. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "affect the situation on the ground" and advance a two-state solution. The decision has drawn criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism. UK opposition parties were also divided, with some arguing for immediate recognition and others claiming the timing is inappropriate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its intention to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific and legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action aimed at saving billions and reinstating consumer choice in the auto market. The proposal would eliminate emissions regulations for vehicles and other sources. This decision has been met with strong condemnation from scientists and environmental groups, who warn it ignores overwhelming evidence of climate change and could be challenged in court.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami alerts across the Pacific region. Japan issued an alert for its coastline, while the United States issued a more severe tsunami warning for Hawaii and parts of Alaska, urging immediate action to protect lives and property. A lower-level tsunami advisory was also put in effect for the entire U.S. West Coast. The quake caused power outages and prompted evacuations in some Russian coastal towns, with authorities warning of potentially damaging waves.</p>

          <p>The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has moved to dismiss charges in two controversial criminal cases shortly after President Trump extended the term of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. The dismissed cases include a $47 million fraud indictment against a Trump donor and an excessive force conviction against an L.A. County sheriff's deputy. This development has intensified concerns about political influence within the Department of Justice, with critics suggesting the decisions represent a politically motivated travesty of justice.</p>

In response, authorities have opened cooling centers and urged residents to stay indoors in air-conditioned spaces as much as possible to avoid heat-related illnesses, as record-high temperatures were recorded in several areas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a party-line vote. Monarez, who holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor, is seen as a somewhat unconventional choice for the role. During her confirmation hearing, she was questioned about her views on vaccines and her potential deference to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known critic of vaccines. Monarez stated that she has seen no causal link between vaccines and autism and committed to prioritizing vaccine availability.</p>

          <p>An American Eagle advertisement featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has created a significant online controversy due to its play on the words "genes" and "jeans." Some critics on social media interpreted the ad's language about inherited traits as a coded reference to eugenics, while others dismissed the outrage, viewing it as a simple pun. The article suggests the incident is a prime example of today's broken discourse, where genuine political anxieties are amplified and distorted by algorithms and media for online engagement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has directed its counsel to draft an ordinance that would prohibit on-duty law enforcement officers from concealing their identities with masks or balaclavas. The move is a direct response to recent federal immigration raids where agents were seen with their faces covered and without visible identification. While the proposed ban would apply to all law enforcement in unincorporated L.A. County, officials acknowledge it will likely face a significant legal challenge from the federal government based on jurisdictional supremacy.</p>
