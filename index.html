          <p>The luxury fashion sector is shifting away from the understated "quiet luxury" trend and embracing more visible, statement-making styles known as "loud luxury." This change, driven by new creative directors at major brands like Gucci and Burberry, aims to inject novelty and reignite desire among consumers weary of recent price hikes. Analysts believe this pivot towards bold branding and distinctive designs could be a turning point for an industry struggling with soft consumer sentiment and economic headwinds.

The article details staff frustration over what they perceive as a slow and inadequate response from the Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose rhetoric they feel has fueled anti-agency sentiment. This attack is seen by staff as a culmination of political attacks that have left them feeling vulnerable and unsupported.</p>

          <p>As the large Lee Fire in Colorado continues to spread, officials ordered the evacuation of nearly 180 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center in the northwestern part of the state. The inmates from the minimum-security facility were safely transferred to other secure locations outside the fire-affected area. The Lee Fire has burned over 92,000 acres and remains only partially contained, prompting new evacuation orders in multiple counties as shifting winds cause it to advance southward.</p>

A combination of post-pandemic inflation, shifting consumer habits among younger generations, and the impact of global trade tariffs has led to slowing sales and financial distress for distilleries. This economic pressure has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks, creating an oversupply in a market that was recently thriving on high demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple experienced its most significant weekly stock gain in more than five years, with shares rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. This surge followed a White House meeting where CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump announced Apple's plan to increase spending with American companies, securing a promise of exemption from future tariffs on imported chips. The positive investor reaction highlights the relief from long-standing worries that potential trade tariffs could have substantially damaged the company's profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JT Lindsey, a freshman running back for Louisiana State University, has been arrested on felony charges for allegedly harboring two murder suspects in his campus dorm room. The two suspects, wanted in connection with a fatal shooting in their shared hometown, were apprehended by U.S. Marshals at Lindsey's apartment, where multiple firearms were also reportedly found. Lindsey's lawyer claims the player was unaware his friends were wanted for murder, but LSU has suspended him from all football activities pending the resolution of the charges.</p>

          <p>Despite new ownership and a rebuilt team, Rangers FC is struggling with familiar issues of inconsistency under new head coach Russell Martin. The team followed a strong 3-0 Champions League qualifying win with a lackluster draw against Dundee, a pattern of dropping points in the domestic league after strong European performances. Martin acknowledged the team's lethargy and the fans' frustration, stating that changing the club's culture and mentality is not a "quick fix" and will require time to yield consistent results.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign nationals after they receive a custodial sentence for a crime. Under the proposal, criminals with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away and barred from re-entry, with their home country deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, though critics warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>A board-certified neurologist is advising people over the age of 50 to eat more pomegranates to support healthy brain aging. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which provide powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and may interact with certain medications, they are highlighted as a top choice among brain-healthy fruits like blueberries and grapes.</p>

Protesters gathered in Parliament Square, intentionally courting arrest by displaying signs supporting the organization, making it a criminal offense. The government proscribed the group after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel, but supporters and human rights groups like Amnesty International argue the ban is a disproportionate and absurd restriction on freedom of expression.</p>
