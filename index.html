        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to release data on the nationalities of foreign criminals, including the crimes they committed. This decision follows pressure on the Labour government to disclose the figures, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper directing officials to compile the data. The move aims to inform the public about foreign offenders awaiting deportation, which numbered over 19,000 at the end of the previous year. The main nationalities for foreign criminals living in the community are expected to be Albanians, Romanians, and Poles, with common offenses including drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta City Council has approved a $1.4 million settlement with Oliver Simmonds, a former Atlanta police officer acquitted in the 2019 fatal shooting of D'Ettrick Griffin.

          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a downturn following President Donald Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump labeled a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates. Trump's call for preemptive rate cuts to stimulate the economy exacerbated market turmoil, already fueled by concerns over tariffs and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experienced significant drops, and investors sought safe-haven assets such as gold, which hit a record high. This ongoing conflict between the president and the Fed chair adds to the uncertainty in the financial markets.</p>

          <p>India and the United States have reported progress in bilateral trade negotiations following a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice-President JD Vance. These talks occur as India seeks to finalize a trade deal before President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on higher tariffs ends. Despite a warm personal relationship between Modi and Trump, trade tensions persist due to US concerns over India's high tariffs. In addition to trade, discussions also covered cooperation in defense, technology, and energy, with Modi expressing anticipation for Trump's visit to India for the Quad summit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Commerce Department plans to impose tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, responding to allegations of Chinese subsidies and unfair dumping practices. These tariffs, known as countervailing and anti-dumping duties, vary by company and country of origin. The move aims to protect US solar panel manufacturers, who claim Chinese-headquartered companies are circumventing trade laws. While beneficial for US manufacturers, the tariffs may increase costs for businesses and consumers who rely on cheaper solar products from Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the United States are causing significant disruptions, with exports of key minerals plummeting and some shipments halting entirely in March. This action, seen as retaliation for US tariffs, is expected to pressure US manufacturers heavily reliant on rare earths from China. The cutbacks have led to substantial declines in US-bound exports of tellurium, tungsten, molybdenum powder, and bismuth products, among others, highlighting China's strategic advantage in the rare earths supply chain.</p>
