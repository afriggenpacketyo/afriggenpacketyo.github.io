          <h2>India's Economy Experiences Strong Growth in March Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 07:18:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy demonstrated robust growth, expanding at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, surpassing economists' expectations amidst global economic uncertainties. This figure marks the strongest quarterly growth for the fiscal year 2025, with the overall economy growing by 6.5% during the entire fiscal year. This growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and a relatively low dependence on exports, which has helped to mitigate the impact of international trade policies. Despite trade tensions with the U.S., India's economic outlook remains positive, as New Delhi is potentially next in line to negotiate a trade agreement with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, addressed criticism regarding the scheduling of night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches. Mauresmo justified the choices by stating that women's matches can potentially be shorter, with only four women's matches scheduled since the introduction of night sessions four years ago. She also cited concerns about late finishes if two matches were scheduled in the night session, unlike the Australian Open and US Open. Despite the criticism, Mauresmo emphasized the tournament's efforts to balance various factors when making scheduling decisions.</p>

          <p>Harvard University's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding visa restrictions for foreign students has sparked debate about potential Supreme Court recusals due to justices' affiliations with the university.

          <p>New research reveals that nearly all of 23 sampled beers in the U.S. contain Pfas, raising concerns about the safety of this popular beverage. The study analyzed craft beers, major domestic brands, and international labels, finding a correlation between Pfas levels in beer and local water supplies. The levels detected sometimes exceeded drinking water limits, with the highest concentrations found in beer from the Cape Fear River Basin in North Carolina. The authors suggest brewers use filtration systems to reduce Pfas levels and advise consumers to check Pfas levels in their beer's bottling location.</p>

          <p>Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe, is now questioning the standard model of cosmology. Riess's measurements of cosmic distances have revealed a discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the observed expansion rate and that predicted by the standard model. This has led him to believe that the theory may be flawed and require a major revision. Riess's willingness to challenge the established model has sparked debate among cosmologists, with some suggesting that the tension may fade with more data.</p>

          <p>ECB President Christine Lagarde suggests the euro could gain international prominence amid geopolitical shifts and uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policies. Lagarde believes a stronger euro would benefit Europe by lowering borrowing costs, insulating it from exchange rate volatility, and protecting it from sanctions. Nomura's George Buckley sees potential for the euro as investors diversify away from the dollar. However, market watchers are divided on the euro's ability to significantly challenge the dollar's status as the world's primary reserve currency. (not investment advice)</p>

Modern society now includes emotional and relational struggles previously considered unavoidable aspects of life in these categories. This shift has created a nearly impossible standard for parenting, where parents are expected to ensure career success and mental well-being into adulthood. The author suggests this new standard is a significant reason for the declining fertility rates among millennials.</p>
