            <h2>Smartphones and Computers Exempted from US Tariffs on China</h2>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from tariffs in the escalating trade war with China, according to a notice published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This move aims to shield American consumers from price increases on these ubiquitous items, potentially preventing significant cost jumps for products like Apple's iPhone, which is largely manufactured in China. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that this decision aligns with Trump's goal of encouraging tech companies to onshore manufacturing in the United States, with investments already secured from companies like Apple, TSMC, and Nvidia.

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey, previously involved in Dominion's settlement with Fox News, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order targeting the firm. The lawsuit argues that Trump is abusing his power to retaliate against organizations he dislikes, specifically for Susman Godfrey's work defending the integrity of the 2020 election. The firm claims the order, which seeks to block their access to government buildings and cancel contracts, would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and agencies. Susman Godfrey continues to represent Dominion in cases against Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell.</p>

            <p>While Apple and other tech companies received a tariff reprieve, many U.S. businesses, especially small businesses, face irreversible damage from Trump's 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China as businesses halt container exports. Industries like furniture, toys, apparel, and footwear are experiencing a complete stop in orders from U.S. importers. Experts warn that these high tariffs could halt most trade between the U.S. and China, leading to lost sales and product shortages for many companies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced that it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from "reciprocal" tariffs, a move that could benefit consumers and tech companies. The exemption applies to items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors, and some chips. This decision is seen as a positive development for companies like Apple and Samsung. The move removes "a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>NYPD dive teams are continuing their search in the Hudson River for the remaining wreckage from Thursday's fatal helicopter crash. Experts believe that recovering missing parts, especially the main rotor, is crucial to determining the cause of the crash that killed all six people on board. A preliminary investigation suggests a rotor may have broken off, causing the helicopter to crash. Authorities are considering several theories, including mechanical failure.</p>

As of January 2024, only about 56% of driver's licenses and IDs in circulation across the country complied with REAL ID.</p>

            <p>The RSPB's annual bird survey reveals a decline in bird populations across the UK, driven by climate change, loss of natural habitats, and bird flu. While blue tit sightings increased, starling numbers are at their lowest since 1979. The RSPB suggests small changes in gardens, like leaving grass uncut and avoiding pesticides, to help survival rates. The article also touches on the importance of appreciating the beauty and friendship of birds to foster a sense of protection.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff strategy is being criticized as an antiquated vision that is not applicable to the modern American economy. Experts argue that the skills and supply chains needed to manufacture complex products like the iPhone are not readily available in the U.S. Bringing manufacturing back home is a difficult and lengthy process, as demonstrated by TSMC's challenges in setting up a fabrication plant in Arizona. Critics suggest that Trump's tariffs are more about asserting power than achieving realistic economic goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The US initially raised levies on Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to counter with new levies on US goods. The US then paused fresh tariffs for most trading partners, but China remained an exception. Observers believe that a resolution is possible if both sides are willing to engage in constructive negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

Economists warn that this could damage the U.S. economy and its relationships with trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>
