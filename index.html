          <p>China's steel industry is grappling with a severe crisis as a relentless price war drives companies to sell their products below cost, erasing profit margins. Industry insiders acknowledge this strategy is unsustainable, likening it to "drinking poison to quench thirst," but feel trapped by chronic oversupply and the need to maintain cash flow. While Beijing has called for an end to the self-destructive competition, firms lack the necessary capital for innovation and differentiation, which are seen as the only long-term solutions to escape the downward economic spiral.

          <p>China's top chipmaker, SMIC, is projecting confidence in the face of a potential 100% U.S. tariff on chip imports, stating the impact on its operations would be minimal. Co-CEO Zhao Haijun explained that the company's production capacity is already fully utilized with demand exceeding supply, and its exposure to the American market is limited. Despite reporting a year-over-year decline in net profit, the company asserts that it has already helped clients build up inventory, anticipating a typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter.

          <p>Following a congressional vote to strip over $500 million in federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the White House has promoted a partnership with PragerU, a right-leaning educational media nonprofit. PragerU, known for creating short videos that have been criticized as promoting climate denialism and historical inaccuracies, is being positioned as an educational resource in public schools across several states. This shift occurs as the defunding threatens the future of local PBS and NPR stations, which have long provided educational content for children.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies infielder Edmundo Sosa created a memorable experience for nine-year-old Dylan Morales, a young fan from his home country of Panama who is being treated for cerebral palsy. Arranged by the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the meeting took place before a game, where Sosa gifted the boy a signed jersey and other team merchandise. The surprise brought joy to Morales and his mother, who have faced significant challenges, including the recent death of the boy's father, during their time in the U.S. for his medical treatment.</p>

          <p>Concerns over a potential price increase for Germany's beloved döner kebab have been alleviated following the settlement of a wage dispute at Birtat, a major producer of döner skewers. Strikes at the production plant had sparked fears among restaurant owners and consumers about a possible shortage of the essential meat component, which could have driven up costs. The resolution comes as a relief during the "silly season" of summer news, ensuring the continued availability of the popular street food at stable prices for the time being.</p>

          <p>A policy analysis explores a macabre feature of the U.S. federal budget known as the "Grim Reaper effect," where policies that save lives and increase longevity can worsen the national deficit. Because the government provides more generous benefits to seniors (like Social Security and Medicare) than to younger people, helping people live longer means they collect these benefits for more years. This creates a paradox where life-saving interventions, such as effective hepatitis C treatments or smoking cessation programs, may not be a "free lunch" financially, as their long-term costs can outweigh the immediate savings.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Truman's decision to use atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 80 years ago was a strategically and morally correct choice that deserves "grudging gratitude." The author contends that the bombings were necessary to prevent a full-scale land invasion of Japan, which would have resulted in catastrophic casualties for both American and Japanese forces. The piece frames the decision as a decisive act that shattered Japan's will to fight, ultimately saving countless lives by bringing World War II to a swift conclusion.</p>

          <p>A popular incentive for electric vehicle drivers in California is set to end on September 30, as the federal authorization for the state's Clean Air Vehicle Decal program expires. For two decades, the program has allowed solo drivers in over half a million qualifying low-emission vehicles to use carpool lanes. An extension would require an act of Congress and the President's signature, which is considered unlikely, potentially removing a key factor that has encouraged the adoption of electric vehicles and helped the state pursue its environmental goals.</p>

The Department of Justice alleges that Jeffery Ying used multiple aliases to access the historical works, some over 600 years old and valued at $216,000, before traveling to China. An investigation was launched after the library noticed several manuscripts were missing, and a raid on Ying's hotel room uncovered materials for creating the "dummy" books, including pre-made asset tags.</p>

The data shows a particularly sharp rise in large-scale losses, with many victims reportedly clearing out retirement and other financial accounts under the scammers' influence, though the true total is likely higher due to underreporting.</p>

The Justice Department, which indicted Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in 2020, stated it has seized over $700 million in assets linked to him. Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the move as a "pathetic" and "crude political propaganda operation."</p>
