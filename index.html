          <p>Authorities are searching for Justin Collin Adams after he allegedly struck two children and one adult with a car outside a preschool at Sunrise Presbyterian Church on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina. One child and one adult were hospitalized, while the third victim was treated at the scene. Police believe the incident may have been intentional, and Adams is considered armed and dangerous, prompting an active manhunt involving the FBI and U.S. Marshals.

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a decline of up to 4% in extended trading after the company released its second fiscal-quarter earnings. While the earnings surpassed Wall Street's expectations, the Services division's performance fell short of estimates. CEO Tim Cook expressed uncertainty regarding the future impact of tariffs on Apple's business beyond June, despite managing to optimize the supply chain and mitigate the impact in the March quarter. Cook mentioned that about half of iPhones sold in the U.S. are sourced from India and most other products from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower, while domestic chip purchases remain substantial.</p>

          <p>Reddit's shares initially surged by as much as 19% after the company reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The gains were tempered to around 5% after executives addressed concerns about the economy and challenges related to Google search. Revenue rose 61% year-over-year, with net income reaching $26.2 million, a significant improvement from the previous year's net loss. CEO Steve Huffman noted that while search-derived traffic might be bumpy, Reddit's long-term strategy remains unaffected, and the company is focusing on user-created content to stand out in the evolving online search market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Michael Waltz will be nominated as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily serve as National Security Advisor. The move came after increasing frustration with Waltz, who faced scrutiny for adding a reporter to a Signal chat discussing a U.S. military strike on Houthi rebels. Trump thanked Waltz for his service, while Rubio expressed honor in continuing to serve the nation. The nomination of Waltz as U.N. ambassador requires Senate approval, potentially leading to uncomfortable confirmation hearings.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reassured investors during the company's first-quarter earnings call, expressing optimism that the company could emerge stronger from the current tariff environment. Jassy pointed to Amazon's broad selection, low pricing, and speedy delivery as factors that have historically helped the company increase its market share during uncertain times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. He noted that while tariffs could impact sellers, Amazon's diverse seller base provides an opportunity for some to absorb costs and maintain competitive pricing. The comments came after Amazon's earnings report, which beat expectations, though operating income forecast for the current period was light.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz has been removed from his role as national security advisor by President Trump, who will nominate him as ambassador to the United Nations. Sources indicate that Waltz was ousted due to the Signal situation, where he mistakenly added a journalist to a chat group containing sensitive military plans, as well as a perception that he did not properly vet National Security Council staff. Trump thanked Waltz for his work and said he would be temporarily replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will continue as America's top diplomat. The BBC suggests the administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate.</p>

Similar actions took place in around 50 cities across the nation, with lawyers expressing concern over Trump's targeting of law firms, wrongful deportations, and the arrest of a Wisconsin judge. Attendees dressed as if they were appearing in court and carried pocket Constitutions, underscoring the seriousness of the moment.

          <p>Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter, marking its third consecutive revenue miss. AWS revenue increased 17% to $29.27 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations. Despite the miss, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, with an operating margin of 39.5%, the widest it has been since at least 2014. CEO Andy Jassy stated that the AWS AI business has billions in annualized revenue and that the company is working to increase capacity for its AI offerings.</p>

          <p>Over 100 people have been killed in recent sectarian violence in Syria, primarily in a region controlled by the Druse minority. The unrest began after an audio clip circulated online, allegedly featuring a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad, leading to attacks by Sunni Muslim extremist groups. Government representatives have since reached accords with Druse leaders, who have signaled a new willingness to join forces with the Sunni Muslim-dominated government. This move may be a step toward integrating armed groups into a national military, with Druse leaders expressing openness to the idea.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a measure that would significantly weaken oversight of religious schools, potentially benefiting the state's Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal has raised concerns among education experts, including the state education commissioner, who argues that it would compromise the future of children attending religious schools lacking basic secular education. The potential changes may include delaying consequences for private schools that receive taxpayer dollars but do not offer basic education in English or math. The New York Times article highlights the years of lobbying by Hasidic leaders and their political representatives.</p>

Bakersfield and San Diego saw the biggest gains, while San Jose and San Francisco experienced slight contractions.
