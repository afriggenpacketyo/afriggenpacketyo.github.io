          <p>Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa is demanding a Department of Education investigation after her son's high school featured announcements about "Bisexual Plus Awareness Week" on its student news program. Hinson criticized the content as inappropriate and an indoctrination of minors, stating parents were not notified about the promotion of "non-monosexual identities." The Linn-Mar Community School District has confirmed it is reviewing the segment to determine if any policies were violated, while Hinson has directly appealed to federal authorities for intervention, citing concerns over parental rights in education.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. The move follows a request from a lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, citing accounts that Earhart may have been on Saipan. While many historians believe Earhart's plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific, theories about a spy mission or capture by the Japanese have persisted for decades, fueling public fascination with the unsolved mystery. It remains unclear what, if any, classified information the government possesses on the matter.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired between 15 and 20 agents who were photographed kneeling at a 2020 racial justice protest following the death of George Floyd. According to US media, the termination letters cited a "lack of judgement," a move condemned by the FBI Agents Association as a violation of the agents' rights. This action is viewed as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to remove officials and policies perceived as left-leaning from federal agencies, further fueling controversy over the politicization of government institutions.</p>

However, a 97th-minute winner from substitute Eddie Nketiah secured a historic victory for Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, moving them to second in the league table. The result highlights Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities despite their recent string of wins.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating the party's policies "will tear this country apart" ahead of the Labour party conference in Liverpool. Starmer highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as particularly "shocking," framing it as an attack on long-term residents contributing to British society. He positioned Labour as the patriotic alternative to what he described as the "toxic divide and decline" offered by Nigel Farage's party, which currently leads Labour in some opinion polls.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal facilities, including an ICE office he claims is "under siege from attack by Antifa." In a social media post, Trump authorized the use of "full force, if necessary," against what he termed "domestic terrorists." The move has drawn immediate criticism from Democratic officials, including Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor, who stated that there is no need for federal intervention and that the number of necessary troops is zero.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's willingness to openly engage in conduct that previous presidents would have concealed is altering the American public's understanding of political scandal. By publicly pressuring the Justice Department or defending ethically questionable actions, Trump frames his behavior as authentic rather than corrupt, desensitizing the public and neutralizing the impact of controversies. This strategy, combined with a constant flood of crises and a lack of institutional pushback from a loyal Republican party, has created a new political dynamic where brazenness can be perceived as strength.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas resulted in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others. The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, opened fire from a nearby rooftop before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, noting that an unspent shell casing found at the scene was engraved with the phrase "ANTI ICE."

          <p>A new scientific study has found that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol by eating fermented fruit. Researchers observed that the animals ingest a daily dose equivalent to about one small bottle of beer for a human. This behavior, documented in national parks in Uganda and the Ivory Coast, suggests that alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots in primates, rather than being a purely human cultural phenomenon. The findings support the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which posits an evolutionary advantage for primates attracted to the scent of ethanol in ripe fruit.</p>

The World Happiness Report measures contentment with life, rather than momentary joy, and experts suggest Finland's success stems from its strong social fabric. Factors contributing to this contentment include a robust social safety net funded by high taxes, free public services like state-of-the-art libraries, and a deep connection to nature. Ultimately, Finnish happiness appears rooted in societal trust and a focus on living a balanced, authentic life.</p>

          <h2>Minnesota Women Lead Fight Against AI-Generated Pornography After Being Victimized</h2>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis has become central to the fight against AI-generated deepfake pornography after discovering a man had used their social media photos to create explicit images on a "nudify" website. The incident exposed a legal loophole, as creating the images for personal use without distributing them may not be illegal in many places. The women's advocacy has led to proposed legislation in Minnesota that would hold AI companies accountable for enabling such tools. Their story highlights the dark side of accessible generative AI technology and the urgent need for updated laws.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all branded or patented pharmaceutical products imported into the United States, starting October 1, 2025. The policy is intended to pressure drug companies to move their manufacturing operations to America. The tariffs will not apply to generic drugs or to companies that are already building or have broken ground on new manufacturing plants in the U.S. The move has sparked confusion and concern in the global pharmaceutical industry, with critics warning it could disrupt supply chains and significantly increase drug costs for American consumers.

          <p>Robert Cary McNair Jr., son of the late Houston Texans founder, is suing the National Football League for over $60 million, alleging "tortious interference" in his family's business. The lawsuit claims the NFL conspired with his brother, Cal McNair, to remove him from his CEO position and silence him after he raised questions about player scandals that could implicate the league. The suit alleges the NFL orchestrated a restructuring of the family trust to exclude Cary McNair Jr. from influential roles, effectively preventing him from having a say in NFL-related matters.</p>

          <p>A Tesla registered to musician D4vd was issued a parking ticket on a Hollywood Hills street 11 days before the body of 15-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez was discovered in its trunk.

          <p>Europe's largest nuclear power plant, the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia facility in Ukraine, has been running on emergency diesel generators for five consecutive days. The record outage of its external power supply, caused by shelling, has prompted severe safety warnings from nuclear experts about the risk of a meltdown. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a new $90 billion arms agreement with the United States. He also criticized Hungary for conducting what he described as "dangerous" drone surveillance activities over Ukrainian territory, further straining regional relations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's struggles continue after a 3-1 defeat at Brentford, a result that keeps the team in the bottom half of the Premier League table. The loss erased the optimism from their prior win against Chelsea and means they have still failed to win consecutive matches under manager Ruben Amorim. In his 33 league games in charge, United have earned just 34 points. Despite repeated questions about his job security, Amorim stated he is not concerned, though he acknowledged his team's frustrating inconsistency and failure to execute game plans.</p>

          <h2>Economist Warns Federal Reserve Is Underestimating AI's Threat to the Labor Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market strategist David Zervos has warned that the Federal Reserve may be overlooking a significant labor market problem created by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. He argues that while AI can drive spectacular economic growth, it could also lead to the loss of three to five million jobs within the next few years. This scenario presents a dilemma for the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and full employment, as the economy could be growing strongly while the unemployment rate simultaneously rises. Zervos suggests the central bank should be more focused on this potential labor displacement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that an Israeli-supplied Patriot air defense system has been operational in Ukraine for the past month, with two more systems expected this fall. The revelation is surprising given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid to Kyiv and its complex relationship with Russia. This development suggests a potential shift in Israeli policy as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran. In other news, the International Paralympic Committee has lifted its ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes, a decision Ukraine's sports minister condemned.</p>

          <p>The head of the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, has unusually summoned hundreds of generals and admirals from around the world for a meeting, causing anxiety and speculation within the U.S. military. The gathering is reportedly for Hegseth to deliver an address on military standards and the "warrior ethos," but the abrupt nature and lack of explanation have led to concerns it could involve more firings or demotions. This follows Hegseth's recent dismissal of over a dozen senior officers and his efforts to reshape the Pentagon under the Trump administration.</p>
