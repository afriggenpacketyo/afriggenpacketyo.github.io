            <p>Technology stocks experienced a sharp decline on Thursday, leading the Nasdaq Composite towards its worst single-day performance since 2020, reversing gains from the previous day's record rally. The tech-heavy index fell by over 7%, mirroring the volatility seen during the 2008 financial crisis and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Major tech companies such as Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet all experienced significant drops, effectively erasing gains made during Wednesday's surge following President Trump's tariff pause announcement.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's decision to temporarily pause tariffs on various trading partners, freight orders have surged as companies react to the changing trade landscape. The EU has also paused retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods for 90 days, further contributing to the increase in bookings. However, tariffs on Chinese goods remain high at 145%, creating ongoing uncertainty. Despite the surge in orders, logistics providers remain cautious, as trade decisions are still heavily influenced by daily headlines, exemplified by the continued tariff policies affecting Mexico and Canada.</p>

            <p>US stock markets experienced a significant downturn on Thursday following the clarification that the tariff rate on Chinese imports has risen to 145%. This figure includes reciprocal duties announced earlier by President Trump and a 20% levy related to fentanyl trafficking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1,700 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also experienced substantial declines. The increased tariff rate is expected to intensify the trade tensions between the US and China, with Chinese officials stating they are prepared to "fight to the end" if the US persists in a trade war.</p>

            <p>A new Netflix docuseries, 'Gone Girls,' examines the Long Island Serial Killer (LISK) case, highlighting the victims and alleged killer Rex Heuermann, while also focusing on how close the case came to remaining unsolved. The series reveals that local authorities, under the leadership of Chief James Burke, could have solved the murders much earlier but were hampered by hubris and corruption. The investigation stalled due to Burke's refusal to work with the FBI and his efforts to cover up the beating of a suspect, ultimately leading to criminal convictions for Burke and others. The docuseries also touches on the victims not closely examined, and their families' continued search for closure.</p>

            <p>Wednesday's surge in stocks, resulting in the S&P 500's third-biggest gain since World War II, was largely fueled by a massive short squeeze. Hedge funds, which had heavily shorted U.S. stocks in anticipation of market declines due to President Trump's tariffs, were forced to rapidly buy back borrowed stocks to limit their losses as the market rallied. This artificial buying pressure pushed stock prices higher, with a basket of the most shorted stocks surging by 12.5%. The trading session also saw a record-breaking 30 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war has introduced significant uncertainty into the oil market, causing volatility in crude prices and undermining investor confidence, which jeopardizes domestic oil production. U.S. crude oil prices have fluctuated dramatically in response to tariff announcements and reversals. The uncertainty makes oil companies hesitant to invest, potentially impacting the president's "drill, baby, drill" agenda. Shale oil companies, which have driven U.S. oil production growth, require crude prices to average at least $65 per barrel to profitably drill new wells, and current prices are hovering in a zone where companies may start reducing drilling activity.

            <p>China's National Film Administration has announced plans to reduce the number of American films imported into the country, escalating the ongoing trade conflict between the two nations. This decision comes in response to President Trump's increase of tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, which includes earlier levies related to fentanyl. Chinese officials stated that the United States' abuse of tariffs would reduce domestic favorability towards American films. China, the world's second-largest film market, has been a crucial audience for Hollywood blockbusters, and this move is expected to impact the revenue of U.S. film studios.</p>

            <p>An economist at the University of Michigan, Justin Wolfers, argues that President Trump's announcement of a tariff 'pause' is misleading and doesn't represent a true reversal of course. While some tariffs were temporarily suspended, significant tariffs remain in place, particularly on Chinese goods, and the overall level of American tariffs is still historically high. Wolfers suggests that the market's positive reaction to the announcement reflects relief that the administration is not as incompetent as previously feared, but the underlying economic challenges and potential for recession remain. He also notes that the volatility and unpredictability of the situation could deter foreign investment in the U.S.</p>

            <p>'Warfare,' co-written and directed by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, offers a taut and terrifyingly realistic portrayal of combat in Ramadi, Iraq, on Nov. 19, 2006. The film eschews typical war movie clichés, focusing instead on the raw, intense, and often tedious realities of warfare. Based on Mendoza's own experiences, the film reenacts a specific instance of combat when his platoon came under heavy fire, aiming to convey the visceral experience of that day. The cast includes young actors on the cusp of mainstream recognition, contributing to a unified portrayal of soldiers intimately familiar with one another.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent pause on some tariffs has created a historic upheaval in American trade policy. While the pause provides relief for some nations, the new minimum 10% tariff rate remains in place for goods coming from all countries, including the UK. For China, the tariff rate will increase to 125%, plus another 20% linked to fentanyl. Economists warn that the pause makes relatively little difference, as the 10% universal rate still applies and the tariff rate on imports from China has increased. Most economists believe that this represents a major shift in US trade policy that will harm the global economy.</p>

However, recent games have shown signs of improvement, with Pages hitting multiple home runs and displaying a more aggressive approach at the plate. Despite the progress, Pages continues to work on his consistency and address areas for improvement, such as defensive fundamentals and baserunning decisions.</p>

            <p>Global bond markets experienced a roller-coaster week, influenced by President Trump's tariff policies and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth. U.S. Treasury yields initially sold off before cooling significantly, reflecting investor concerns about the inflationary effects of the tariffs. Trump's decision to pause some tariffs was influenced by the bond market's reaction, as a sustained rise in yields could lead to higher borrowing costs and a weaker economy. The U.K. bond market was also swept up in the turmoil, with yields spiking before tumbling after the tariff pause.</p>

            <p>Researchers and public health officials are concerned that President Trump's aggressive immigration tactics are hindering efforts to prevent a potential bird flu pandemic. The fear of deportation is causing farmworkers, who are at high risk of contracting the virus, to avoid contact with health officials and testing facilities. This lack of surveillance and prevention measures could allow the virus to mutate and spread more easily among humans. Experts worry that this situation could lead to a catastrophic pandemic, overwhelming healthcare systems and causing millions of deaths.</p>

            <p>Inflation slowed in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, but economists warn that tariffs could reverse this trend and that grocery prices remain a concern. The consumer price index rose 2.4% for the 12 months ended in March, down from 2.8% in February. However, economists emphasize that tariffs, a tax paid by U.S. importers, add costs for businesses that ultimately get passed to consumers. Some economists predict that Trump's tariff policy will push the U.S. inflation rate to around 4% by the end of 2025, roughly double the Fed's long-term target. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>According to BBC Economics editor Faisal Islam, Donald Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs is far from a trade victory and the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s. The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it. Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will negotiate with America while things are as they are. There is a calm, welcomed by all, but it could be rather brief.</p>
