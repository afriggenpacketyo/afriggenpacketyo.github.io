          <p>American Airlines has significantly scaled back its 2025 profit outlook, now projecting a potential adjusted loss per share, a stark reduction from its January estimates. The carrier also issued a third-quarter forecast that fell short of analyst expectations, citing weaker-than-expected demand and ongoing market uncertainties. Despite these challenges, the airline's second-quarter earnings and revenue slightly surpassed Wall Street estimates, though net income saw a notable decline from the previous year. The company noted that achieving the high end of its revised forecast depends on a continued improvement in the domestic travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The prime ministers of the UK and India have signed a major free trade agreement, a deal hailed as the most significant for Britain since Brexit. The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports such as textiles and jewellery to the UK, aiming to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually. The deal, which took three years to negotiate, also includes commitments to tackle illegal migration and enhance collaboration on defense and technology. While celebrated by the government, the agreement still requires UK parliamentary approval before it can take effect.</p>

          <p>New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicates that approximately one in eight women in England and Wales were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking in the last year. The Crime Survey for England and Wales found that 12.8% of women experienced one or more of these offenses, compared to 8.4% of men. This is the first time the ONS has provided a combined estimate for these crimes, as part of a government initiative to halve violence against women and girls. The report also highlighted a record high in shoplifting offenses and a significant increase in fraud.</p>

          <p>Police documents released after Bryan Kohberger's sentencing reveal unsettling events at the victims' home in the weeks before the November 2022 University of Idaho murders. One victim reported seeing an unknown man staring at her, and on another occasion, the residents found their front door mysteriously open.

The documents also describe Kohberger's brief interview with police after his arrest, where he requested a lawyer before any substantive questioning about the crime occurred.</p>

The party, which is not yet registered with the Electoral Commission, is expected to field candidates in local elections next year.

          <p>The traditional summer camp experience has shifted, driven by the preferences of millennial parents and a changing culture. Camps are increasingly specialized, focusing on skills like coding or ceramics, and offer shorter, more flexible sessions rather than running all summer. This evolution caters to desires for skill development and complex family schedules but may also reduce opportunities for deep friendships and add academic pressure to summer vacation. The article traces the history of summer camps from their 19th-century origins, suggesting they have always reflected adult anxieties more than children's desires for unstructured fun.</p>

          <p>Electricity prices across the United States have been rising faster than inflation since 2022 and are projected to continue this trend through 2026. The increase is driven by a combination of high demand, insufficient supply, and the significant costs of replacing aging grid infrastructure. Utilities are requesting billions in rate hikes as they invest more in transmission and distribution systems. While the Trump administration has promised to lower energy costs, its policies, including the rollback of renewable incentives, are seen by some analysts as likely to exacerbate the problem by slowing the deployment of new, cheaper power generation.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops along their disputed border have resulted in the deaths of at least twelve people, mostly Thai civilians. The fighting, which involved gunfire, rockets, and Thai airstrikes, marks a major escalation of a long-standing territorial dispute. Both nations have accused the other of initiating the conflict and have evacuated thousands of civilians from the border region. The conflict stems from a century-old border demarcation, with tensions recently flaring over a temple in the disputed area, leading to a severe deterioration in diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has conducted its largest-ever operation against an extortion ring, dismantling a criminal group with ties to a major drug cartel. The gang operated in the central State of Mexico, extorting businesses and controlling labor unions across various industries. The crackdown, involving nearly 3,000 security personnel and 52 raids, led to eight key arrests and the seizure of stolen animals, vehicles, and construction materials. Officials stated the operation was crucial for protecting the local economy and the safety of thousands of families affected by the widespread criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced it will relax restrictions on U.S. beef imports, a move the Trump administration hailed as a "major trade breakthrough." The restrictions were originally put in place over concerns about mad cow disease (BSE). Australian authorities now say they are satisfied with new U.S. control measures for tracing cattle from Canada and Mexico. The decision follows pressure from President Trump, who had criticized the ban while imposing tariffs on Australian goods. While the Australian government insists the decision is based on science, some critics suspect it is a political move to appease the U.S.</p>

          <p>Food giant Nestle has indicated that prices for products like KitKat bars and Nespresso coffee could rise again in the latter half of the year. The company is facing significant pressure from historically high commodity costs for cocoa and coffee, which could be worsened by U.S. tariffs. While Nestle implemented broad price hikes in the first half of the year, leading to better-than-expected organic sales growth, its profit margins have dipped. The company is maintaining its 2025 guidance but anticipates that headwinds from currency fluctuations and input costs will intensify. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese agricultural authorities are taking steps to reduce the country's hog breeding population in response to a prolonged oversupply that has caused a sharp decline in pork prices. The industry has faced over seven consecutive months of losses, an unprecedented situation driven by weak consumer demand and high inventory levels. At the end of June, the national breeding sow inventory was still 3.7% above the official target of 39 million.

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that while most Americans consider Social Security important, many hold significant misconceptions about how the program functions. For instance, 47% of respondents incorrectly believe that benefits will be cut by at least half when the program's trust funds are depleted, whereas the official projection is a 19% reduction. The survey also found that confidence in the program's future has declined over the past five years. As the program approaches its 90th anniversary, these findings highlight a need for better public understanding of its financial realities and benefit structure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The use of AI to offer personalized prices to individual consumers, a practice sometimes called "surveillance pricing," is becoming more common and is drawing significant criticism. Delta Air Lines recently faced backlash after revealing plans to expand its use of AI for dynamic fare pricing, prompting calls for a federal ban on the practice. This advanced form of dynamic pricing uses personal data like location and search history to set different prices for different people. While companies often deny targeting individuals based on personal data, investigations have found evidence of the practice, raising concerns about fairness, privacy, and algorithmic exploitation.</p>

The author contends that by targeting Obama, Trump is attempting to shift the narrative and energize his supporters with a familiar political foe.
