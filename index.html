          <p>Prince William was visibly touched during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, who shared her experience of losing her husband to suicide after the death of their one-year-old son. Mannings has since established a bereavement charity, which will receive £1 million from Prince William's Royal Foundation to develop a National Suicide Prevention Network. The network aims to understand the root causes of suicide and provide support to those affected, addressing the stigma surrounding suicide and encouraging open conversation about mental health struggles. Prince William emphasized the importance of a unified national response to prevent suicide, acknowledging the profound impact of loss and the need for accessible support. The conversation highlighted the importance of speaking out and seeking help in times of despair, with Mannings expressing the wish that her husband had felt able to confide in her. </p>

          <p>Speculation arises over tech billionaires, like Mark Zuckerberg, engaging in "doom prepping" with sprawling compounds and underground shelters. Reid Hoffman mentions "apocalypse insurance" among the super-wealthy, fueling worries about future catastrophic events like war, climate change, or AI risks. Ilya Sutskever, from Open AI, reportedly suggested building a bunker for top scientists before releasing advanced AI. The debate revolves around the potential dangers of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial super intelligence (ASI), with some experts warning about the need to control or even switch off such technologies. While some dismiss the idea of AGI as absurd, others emphasize the importance of addressing current AI's potential misuse and ensuring it benefits humanity. </p>

          <p>Peru's Congress voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her government's failure to address the country's rising crime rates. The impeachment occurred shortly after a shooting at a concert in Lima, highlighting public anger over increasing homicides and extortion cases. Congress leader Jose Jeri was sworn in as interim president until the next elections in April 2026. Boluarte, who took office in December 2022 as Peru's first female president, struggled to manage the country's escalating crime problems and faced numerous scandals. The vote reflects widespread dissatisfaction with her administration's performance and its inability to curb violence and insecurity. </p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks caused power cuts in Kyiv, Ukraine, injuring nine people and disrupting water supplies. A seven-year-old child was killed in a separate Russian drone strike in the Zaporizhzhia area. Moscow has escalated attacks on energy facilities in recent weeks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accusing Russia of attempting to create chaos and apply psychological pressure. Ukraine's Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk reported a massive strike on facilities across the country, with repair crews working to restore power. The attacks follow nights of air raids in the region, with all of Ukraine on alert for hypersonic Kinzhal missile strikes. </p>

          <p>Universities in England could face sanctions if pro-Palestinian protests lead to harassment and discrimination against Jewish students, according to the Office for Students (OfS). Arif Ahmed, the OfS's free speech director, emphasized that freedom of speech does not include the freedom to intimidate or harass Jewish students. The regulator has the authority to issue fines, cut off public funding, and revoke degree-awarding powers if universities fail to protect Jewish students. The warning follows a wave of pro-Palestinian protests on the second anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel, despite calls from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to avoid demonstrations that could incite antisemitism. </p>

Analysts forecast an 8% drop in new home sales, attributing the weaker outlook to fragile homebuyer sentiment. Despite Beijing's efforts to stabilize the sector, limited easing of mortgage rates signals a less aggressive policy approach. The agency anticipates a further sales decline in 2026, emphasizing the need for government support to restore consumer confidence. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The American Trucking Associations (ATA) is urging lawmakers to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA) as online cargo theft surges, rising 1,500% in the past four years. Fraudsters are increasingly targeting the trucking industry, stealing identities and diverting cargo, often operating from Eastern Europe. The ATA reports that cargo theft costs the industry $19 million a day, with California, Texas, and Illinois being the most affected states. The proposed CORCA would establish a task force and a national cargo theft database to combat these criminal rings, providing law enforcement with a unified framework. Increased theft claims have also led to higher business insurance rates, potentially resulting in increased prices for shoppers. </p>

          <h2>Judge Dismisses Drake's Lawsuit Over Kendrick Lamar's 'Not Like Us'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's song "Not Like Us." Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that Lamar's lyrics, accusing Drake and his associates of being "certified paedophiles", were "nonactionable opinion" and not defamatory. Drake filed the lawsuit in January, alleging that UMG spread a "false and malicious narrative" by allowing the song to be published. Drake's spokesperson stated that he plans to appeal the ruling, while UMG expressed satisfaction with the outcome. The song, widely seen as a decisive blow in a rap battle between the two artists, has become a major hit for Lamar. </p>

          <p>A US federal judge ordered a temporary halt to President Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers in Illinois, including Chicago. The Trump administration had ordered the troops to protect federal officials and facilities from violent protesters. Judge April Perry said allowing Guard troops would only "add fuel to the fire," siding with Chicago and Illinois, who sued to stop the deployment. The judge expressed doubt over the federal government's claims of violence during protests, stating that the Department of Homeland Security's narrative was unreliable. The order will be in effect for two weeks, with the Trump administration planning to appeal. </p>

Sutfin-Glowski stated he could no longer accept enabling what he believes are atrocities, referring to a February report indicating the Israeli military had at least 635 active Microsoft subscriptions. The resignation follows months of employee protests against Microsoft's cloud business with the Israeli military, during which five employees were fired. Sutfin-Glowski claimed that Microsoft cut off communication systems that allowed employees to raise concerns about the issue. Outside Microsoft headquarters, employees and community members protested, calling for the company to end ties with Israel. </p>

A gauge of Chinese semiconductor shares has surged 55% since the end of June, outperforming chip stocks in other major markets. Concerns are rising that these high multiples leave little margin for error, and investors may lose patience if companies fail to deliver.
