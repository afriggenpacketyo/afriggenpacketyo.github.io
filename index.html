          <p>President Trump's rhetoric and tariff wars have created uncertainty for America's European allies, particularly concerning trade and defense spending. Trump has criticized Europe's trade practices and insisted on increased defense contributions from NATO members, shaking the foundations of the transatlantic alliance. While some Europeans acknowledge the need for greater defense investment, there are growing fears that the Trump administration may abandon them, undermining decades of cooperation. This article highlights the rising perception among Europeans that their commitment to the relationship with the U.S. surpasses that of the current U.S. administration. Optimism is tempered by concerns about the future of transatlantic relations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration sued Colorado and Denver, accusing the state, city, and their leaders of impeding federal immigration actions. The lawsuit challenges state and city laws that restrict cooperation with federal agencies. The suit asks the court to rule the laws unconstitutional and prohibit their enforcement. The lawsuit against Colorado officials is similar to one the administration filed against Illinois and Chicago in February.</p>
