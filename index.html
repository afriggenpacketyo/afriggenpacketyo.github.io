          <p>A student opened fire at Evergreen High School near Denver, wounding two classmates before taking his own life. One victim is in critical condition, while the other sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities responded within minutes, and no officers discharged their weapons, confirming the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident, which occurred during lunchtime, has prompted the cancellation of classes and an outpouring of concern from state officials, highlighting ongoing challenges with school safety protocols during non-classroom periods.</p>

While the Nikkei saw significant gains led by energy and utilities, other regional markets like Hong Kong and mainland China experienced declines. (not investment advice)</p>

The 10.3km structure is a major engineering feat, as it is the first to integrate an expressway, a local road, and an intercity railway on a single crossing. Its design features an innovative asymmetrical lower deck to balance the different weights of the high-speed railway and the conventional road. The bridge represents a significant advancement in China's infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is appealing a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocked him from removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The judge had argued that maintaining the Federal Reserve's independence was in the public interest and that Cook was likely to succeed in her lawsuit challenging the dismissal. Trump sought to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The legal battle unfolds as Trump aims to increase his influence over the central bank's board.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that conservative activist Charlie Kirk died after being shot during an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was the founder of the influential youth organization Turning Point USA and a prominent ally of the Trump administration. The shooting has been widely condemned as an act of political violence by figures from across the political spectrum. Utah's governor labeled the fatal attack a "political assassination," and an investigation involving federal and local law enforcement is currently underway to find the person responsible for the attack.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of West Virginia's rural population, estimated at 250,000 residents, lacks access to reliable, treated drinking water, forcing many to depend on untreated sources like abandoned coal mines. This long-standing issue stems from the decline of the coal industry, which previously maintained local water infrastructure, leaving behind crumbling treatment plants. Nonprofits like DigDeep are now intervening to build new systems for communities that have gone years without clean tap water.

          <p>Senior cancer specialists in the UK are raising alarms that bureaucratic hurdles and funding inconsistencies are creating a "postcode lottery" for patients seeking advanced cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists states that cumbersome application processes are hindering access to innovative therapies like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR), leading to disparities where availability depends on a hospital's location and resources. While survival rates have been improving due to new technologies, doctors argue that red tape is preventing some patients from benefiting from these life-saving advances.</p>

          <p>A long-standing perk for California drivers of electric and other low-emission vehicles is set to expire on October 1, as the federal program allowing solo access to carpool lanes was not renewed. The California DMV has stopped issuing new Clean Air Vehicle decals, affecting approximately half a million motorists who will no longer be able to use carpool lanes without multiple occupants. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's failure to extend the popular bipartisan program, stating it would lead to increased traffic and smog.</p>

A staunch advocate for free speech and limited government, Kirk was also a controversial figure for promoting far-right personalities and spreading misinformation. His work was instrumental in organizing for the Trump campaign and he is remembered as a key architect of the contemporary young conservative movement.</p>

          <p>Following a successful initial public offering where its stock climbed 14.5% on the first day, financial technology company Klarna is still a recommended buy, according to CNBC's Jim Cramer.

Cramer highlighted Klarna's diverse revenue streams beyond its well-known "buy now, pay later" service, though he noted the IPO primarily benefited existing shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State lawmakers have introduced legislation to reform Measure ULA, the Los Angeles "mansion tax," in an effort to encourage housing construction. The bill would significantly lower the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties, addressing criticism that the measure has had a chilling effect on new development. This proposal is also part of a larger political strategy to dissuade support for a statewide ballot initiative that would nullify Measure ULA entirely. The move has sparked debate, with ULA proponents arguing it overrides the will of L.A. voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional "stand and stir" television cooking shows are experiencing a sharp decline in commissions, with major broadcasters producing far fewer new programs. This trend coincides with the explosive growth of food content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where influencers can react to trends almost instantly. Analysts suggest that the high production costs, regulatory compliance, and slower pace of television cannot compete with the authenticity, speed, and direct community engagement offered by online creators. This shift reflects a broader cultural change in media consumption towards more raw, user-generated content.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer reflected on the changes in market psychology over the past three decades. He recalled the early days of the show in the 1990s, when there was widespread optimism and excitement among individual investors, a sentiment he believes is returning to the market today. Cramer noted that after the dot-com bust, many investors shifted to index funds out of fear, but now sees a renewed interest in single-stock rewards. He credited the show with helping to democratize access to market information for everyday people.</p>

MPs argue that the LISA's dual purpose for both retirement and first-home savings can lead to poor investment choices and unfairly penalizes benefit claimants. The committee is calling for more significant changes to be included in the upcoming November Budget. They also questioned the product's value for taxpayers, given its high cost and findings that most users could have bought a home without it.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. Scientists hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' "dark DNA," the non-gene portions of the genetic code whose function is largely unknown. This mysterious DNA, which is three times more abundant in peacock spiders than in humans, might enable them to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. By studying this extreme case of variation, researchers hope to gain broader insights into the evolutionary processes that create biodiversity across the natural world.</p>
