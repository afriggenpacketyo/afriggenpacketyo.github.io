            <p>A recent study sheds light on why men are less likely to visit doctors compared to women, citing societal pressures to "tough it out" and perceived weakness in discussing health concerns. The article highlights that men often delay seeking help until symptoms become severe, affecting their health outcomes. It also points out that appointment systems and services may not cater to men's working patterns or communication styles. Experts suggest redesigning healthcare services to better meet men's needs, focusing on action-oriented approaches rather than solely relying on open discussion.</p>

This work aims to create geohazard maps for the Greek Civil Protection Agency and inform local residents about volcanic activity and restricted access areas. The study also highlights the global significance of understanding underwater volcanoes, which are often under-monitored.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an appeal by the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, ensuring detainees have a chance to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely. The White House claimed the detainees were "foreign terrorists," while the ACLU cited concerns over potential human rights abuses, referring to previous deportations to El Salvador's CECOT prison.</p>

Bukele directed his proposal to President Nicolás Maduro, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained in Venezuela. The proposal comes amid international scrutiny of El Salvador's detention of deportees, including a U.S. resident, in the CECOT mega-prison. Bukele maintains those detained are gang members, despite controversy and calls for their release.</p>
