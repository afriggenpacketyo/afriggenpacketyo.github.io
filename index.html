          <p>Prior to Bhim Kohli's death after a racially motivated attack, police were informed of a similar incident in the same area involving the same victim, who reported being racially abused and having a rock thrown at him by two young boys. This earlier incident, along with other reports of anti-social behavior, prompted community members to voice concerns about the lack of police presence and the potential for escalating violence. While an internal investigation found no misconduct, the attacks have left the initial victim fearful and highlighted the need for improved anti-social behavior logging. The court heard that the girl convicted of manslaughter in Kohli's death was present while other children threw apples at him a week or two before the fatal incident. The incident has raised questions about community safety and police response. Optimism score not included in summary.</p>

          <p>SkillStorm CEO Justin Vianello discussed the challenges the federal government faces in hiring skilled workers, particularly in cybersecurity and tech, which can lead to national security vulnerabilities. He proposes an extended "on-ramp" time of two to four months to custom-build teams with the necessary skills and certifications, addressing the inefficiencies of the current procurement process. Vianello highlights SkillStorm's Performance Acceleration Center for Excellence, which trains and upskills individuals for rapid deployment, offering a cost-effective solution to create U.S.-based tech teams. Former GSA head Emily Murphy supports this approach, emphasizing the need for a new pipeline of clearance-eligible professionals trained on mission-specific tools.

          <p>The Canadian government has introduced the Strong Borders Act, a bill aimed at restricting asylum claims and enhancing authorities' powers to halt immigration application processing. Immigration Minister Lena Diab said the bill targets organized crime, illegal drugs, and weapons, while strengthening the integrity of the immigration system. The bill would also give police greater border monitoring authority, potentially bar asylum claims from individuals in Canada for over a year, and allow the government to suspend application processing for public health or national security reasons. Critics argue that some provisions, such as expanded mail inspection powers, could infringe on civil liberties. Optimism score not included in summary.</p>
