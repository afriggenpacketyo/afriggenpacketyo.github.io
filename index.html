The resentencing came after emotional testimony from family, who argued that the brothers had served enough time and have been forgiven.

The decision comes despite criticism from consumer groups and homeowners who allege unfair claim denials and lowball offers after recent fires. Consumer Watchdog claims State Farm exaggerated financial strain and the increase is unjustified. The state's insurance commissioner framed the decision as a difficult compromise amidst a statewide insurance crisis.</p>
