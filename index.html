          <p>Communities in Switzerland's LÃ¶tschental valley are preparing for potential evacuation after a massive landslide caused by the collapse of the Birch Glacier. Millions of cubic meters of ice, rock, and mud have engulfed the village of Blatten, blocking the River Lonza and causing water levels to rise rapidly. Authorities are concerned about the risk of further rockfalls and the potential for the blocked river to dislodge, impacting downstream communities. The Swiss army is on standby to assist with cleanup operations, but the search for a missing 64-year-old man has been suspended due to dangerous conditions. The rising water levels are a major concern, increasing the risk of flooding in the affected areas. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly attacked conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, accusing him of being a "bad person" who "probably hates America." Trump's outburst followed a ruling by a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, that deemed most of his tariffs illegal. Trump claimed the judges made the decision because they dislike him, and he extended his criticism to Leo and the Federalist Society, which had previously advised him on judicial nominations. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the federal courts, highlighting it as his most important legacy. Trump suggested Leo has left the Federalist Society to pursue his own ambitions, possibly referring to Leo's work with the Teneo Network, which aims to challenge liberal dominance in various fields. </p>

          <p>An urgent alert has been issued by the Austin Police Department for McArthur Mathis, an inmate who escaped from a psychiatric hospital in Texas. Mathis, who was in custody from Grimes County due to multiple warrants, is considered armed and dangerous due to his criminal history. He is facing several charges, including unlawful possession of a firearm, aggravated assault, obstruction, deadly conduct, and burglary. Police believe Mathis may attempt to return to known contacts in Grimes, Lavaca, Brazos, or Gonzales counties, and the public is urged to contact the Grimes County Sheriffâ€™s Office with any information. Due to the violent nature of his past crimes, Mathis poses a serious threat to the community.</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk that had been terrorizing the village of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for dive-bombing attacks on approximately 50 people, with one victim requiring hospital treatment. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the bird, noting that its behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial issues. Housden spent around Â£1,000 building an aviary for the hawk and plans to feature it at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August. The falconer believes the hawk was a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner, and he intends to ensure it will not be failed again.</p>

The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods and potential similar measures in the EU and the U.K. have further complicated the company's situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Glaciers worldwide are melting at an alarming rate, impacting water supply, infrastructure, and cultural traditions. The collapse of a glacier in the Swiss Alps and subsequent flooding highlight the risks associated with thawing ice. Two billion people rely on glacial melt for their daily water needs, but as glaciers shrink, communities face water shortages and increased flooding risks. The melting ice also damages infrastructure and destabilizes mountains, leading to deadly floods and landslides. These changes threaten agriculture, electricity generation, and spiritual practices tied to glaciers, necessitating early warning systems and adaptation strategies. </p>

          <p>A top UN official has accused Israel of subjecting people in Gaza to forced starvation, which he identifies as a war crime. Tom Fletcher, speaking to the BBC, asserted that Israel is preventing food from entering Gaza while its population is starving, with Israeli ministers indicating this is a deliberate tactic. He called on Prime Minister Netanyahu to disavow statements promoting forced displacement and to uphold international humanitarian law. Fletcher also addressed criticism he received after claiming 14,000 babies could die if aid was not allowed in, acknowledging the need for precision in his language. Despite facing scrutiny, he reiterated his commitment to advocating for the lives of those in Gaza and urged Hamas to release Israeli hostages.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling regarding Trump's trade tariffs has raised questions about its impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. While a New York court deemed the blanket import taxes imposed by Trump illegal, an appeals court has paused the ruling pending further argument. The tariffs in question do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are significant UK exports to the US. Although the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this agreement has not yet been implemented, leaving the situation uncertain. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision. </p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in tackling climate change by locking away greenhouse gases. Saltmarshes, which have been significantly reduced due to agriculture, act as natural carbon sinks and flood defenses. WWF is advocating for the inclusion of these tidal habitats in the UK's official carbon inventory to incentivize their restoration and protection. Researchers have installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that these areas absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in the winter. The report emphasizes that mud in saltmarshes is as crucial for climate mitigation as trees are.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first debate in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to keep separate surnames. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three opposition-proposed bills appears unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A revision to the Civil Code is necessary to enable couples to maintain different family names, with most women currently abandoning their maiden names after marriage. A recent Kyodo News poll showed that 71% of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>

Tokyo's core consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in over two years, while Japan's unemployment rate and job availability ratio remained unchanged in April. Japan is also lifting some sanctions against Syria to aid rebuilding efforts after the fall of Bashar al-Assad.</p>
