          <p>Shares of Kering, the French fashion house owning Gucci and Saint Laurent, surged by 7% following reports that Renault's Luca de Meo is set to become the group's CEO. De Meo's potential appointment comes as Kering seeks to revitalize its Gucci brand, which has experienced declining sales and designer changes. Analysts suggest that de Meo's experience in brand management and technological innovation at Renault could be beneficial, but acknowledge the challenges in turning around luxury brands. Kering's shares have dropped over 60% in the past two years due to profit warnings and struggles with the Gucci label. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European leaders are showing increased interest in Southeast Asia as an alternative ally amidst trade tensions between the U.S. and China. French President Emmanuel Macron advocated for stronger ties between Europe and the Indo-Pacific, drawing parallels between China's actions in the South China Sea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, analysts suggest that economic ties are more crucial than political alignment in Southeast Asia, with China currently being the region's largest trading partner. While the EU has trade agreements with Singapore and Vietnam, broader EU-ASEAN trade deals have stalled, hindering Europe's ability to compete with the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Scotland is set to export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England due to an upcoming ban on landfilling biodegradable municipal waste. The ban, effective at the end of the year, aims to reduce methane emissions but faces challenges due to insufficient incinerator capacity. Environmental consultants estimate a capacity gap of 600,000 tonnes in the first year, leading councils and waste companies to seek contracts in England. Concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of transporting waste and the lack of progress in domestic recycling rates.</p>

          <p>As anti-ICE protests persist in major U.S. cities, federal authorities are considering domestic terrorism charges against individuals engaged in violent actions. According to a retired FBI agent, violent acts intended to intimidate the public or influence government decisions through force could be classified as domestic terrorism. While there is no specific domestic terrorism charge, prosecutors may use existing laws such as arson, assault on federal officers, or destruction of property. The FBI is reportedly focusing on a core group of organized anarchists believed to be instigating violence at these protests.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing internal opposition within the Labour Party regarding his plans to cut the benefits bill by £5 billion by 2030. The proposed measures include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a benefit for individuals with long-term health conditions. While ministers have introduced a 13-week transition period for those losing benefits, many Labour MPs remain critical, and the welfare package could push an additional 250,000 people into poverty. Starmer maintains that reforms are necessary to ensure the system works for both those needing support and taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a new wave of missile attacks on Israel, resulting in at least five deaths and numerous injuries, marking the fourth day of intensified conflict between the two nations. The attacks prompted air raid sirens across Israel, with one missile landing near the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv. Israel responded by striking command centers in Tehran belonging to Iran's Quds Force, and the Israeli Defense Minister warned Tehran's residents would "pay the price" for the strikes on Israeli civilians. The ongoing conflict has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran.</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza are facing severe hunger and violence as they seek aid at US-backed distribution points, which have become death traps. Israeli forces have reportedly killed numerous people on their way to or at these facilities, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. The aid distribution system is described as chaotic and inhumane, with people forced to fight for limited supplies. In contrast, the previous UNRWA aid system is remembered as structured, humane, and community-based, providing a more dignified approach to distributing essential resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams in the Yellow River's estuary will become more frequent due to global warming by the end of the century, impacting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. As warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart, it drifts downstream and refreezes in colder areas, forming ice jams. These localized hazards can cause destructive flooding, damaging communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. The study highlights the need for proactive measures to mitigate the risks associated with increased ice jam frequency in the region.</p>

This move reinforces existing policies and tightens loopholes, potentially raising penalties for future breaches.

          <p>Hospice staff in the UK are at the center of the debate over the assisted dying bill, sharing their perspectives on the proposed legislation. Many staff members express uncertainty about how legalizing assisted dying would affect their services, while also voicing concern about funding shortages. The bill would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live the right to medically end their lives in England and Wales. While some support giving terminal patients autonomy, others worry about pressure on patients and the need to improve palliative care.</p>
