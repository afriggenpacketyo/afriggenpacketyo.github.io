          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump following his election on an anti-Trump platform, aiming to prevent Canada from becoming integrated into the United States. Carney emphasized Canada's independence, stating it was 'not for sale,' while Trump offered a playful retort. Despite Trump's pre-meeting criticisms of Canada on social media, the tone during their public meeting was more conciliatory, with Trump praising Carney's electoral victory. The leaders then proceeded to a private working lunch to discuss trade, security, and defense issues, aiming to address the strained relationship between the two countries.</p>

The article notes that while Abel may not have Buffett's stock-picking prowess, investors seem reassured by Buffett's plan to remain involved as chairman. Buffett himself stated that keeping all his shares was an 'economic decision' because he believes Berkshire's prospects are better under Abel's management (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elite law firms are increasingly declining to offer pro bono services for lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's policies, fearing retribution. This shift marks a significant change from Trump's first term when many firms actively challenged his administration. The article highlights how executive orders targeting law firms that represent clients the administration dislikes have created a 'chilling effect,' with firms opting to avoid immigration litigation and other cases that challenge Trump's agenda. Public interest groups are now seeking new partners to fill the void, as major firms become unwilling or unable to defend the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The White House is pushing back against legal challenges from Democratic states opposing President Trump's temporary withdrawal of offshore wind energy leases and review of wind power permitting practices. Several states are suing the administration, arguing that the move halts progress on renewable energy projects and threatens jobs. The White House claims these states are using 'lawfare' to obstruct Trump's energy agenda, while state officials argue that the directive is reckless and will harm clean energy initiatives and their economies. The debate highlights the ongoing conflict between the administration's energy policies and states' efforts to promote renewable energy.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. military would cease bombing the Houthis in Yemen, citing an agreement where the group promised to end attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis have not publicly confirmed the agreement, but Oman's foreign ministry stated that a ceasefire had been brokered. This announcement follows a period of U.S. airstrikes against Houthi targets in response to the group's disruption of crucial shipping lanes. While the Houthis initially vowed to retaliate against Israeli strikes, Trump claims they have now 'capitulated' and seek an end to hostilities.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka led a protest outside an immigrant detention facility, arguing that the owner, GEO Group, lacks valid permits to operate. The facility is expected to hold up to 1,000 migrants a day. City officials have been arguing in federal court that GEO Group is in violation of city laws. Baraka vowed to return each day until city officials were allowed inside to reinspect the facility. The Department of Homeland Security claims the detention center has 'valid permits' and that there are 'no safety issues'.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film, Ocean, which he calls his most important message yet, emphasizing the ocean's crucial role in saving biodiversity and combating climate change. The film documents the catastrophic decline in ocean life and highlights the damage caused by practices like bottom trawling. Attenborough expresses optimism that the ocean can recover faster than imagined, citing the recovery of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling.
