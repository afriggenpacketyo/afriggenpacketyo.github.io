Litman's new book details how millennials and Gen Z leaders can remake their workplaces, advocating for separating work from personhood and bringing authentic selves to work.

          <p>The author argues that summer is an overrated season, citing reasons such as extreme heat, boredom, and the disappointing reality of vacations. The author points out that summer's major events are limited to Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, leading to months of indistinguishable days. The author also critiques the collective action problem of summer, where everything slows down and big cultural events are delayed until the fall. Ultimately, the author suggests lowering expectations for summer and acknowledging it as just three months in the middle of the year.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China and a potential Republican tax bill could derail the burgeoning U.S. battery industry, which is crucial for meeting rising energy demands. Domestic factories depend on Chinese components and federal subsidies, both of which are threatened by these policies. Tariffs have already caused battery costs to rise, and the proposed tax bill could restrict access to subsidies for making and using rechargeable batteries. The uncertainty surrounding these policies is causing businesses to delay projects and new contracts, potentially hindering the country's ability to meet rising power demand and transition to renewable energy sources (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is using a strategy of "legalistic noncompliance" to flout court orders while claiming to comply with the law, according to an analysis of dozens of cases. This involves using specious legal arguments to conceal defiance of judicial oversight, making it difficult for the public to recognize the noncompliance. Examples include arguments made in the Alien Enemies Act litigation and the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The strategy could lead to legalized noncompliance, where courts issue rules that allow the administration to appear compliant while doing little to carry out rulings.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in numerous casualties, including a deadly attack on a school-turned-shelter, sparking international concern. Cindy McCain says aid trucks to Gaza are a "drop in the bucket as to what's needed." Amidst growing concerns over food shortages, a new aid system supported by the U.S. and Israel is set to begin operations, despite the resignation of its American leader, Jake Wood, who cited a lack of operational independence. The UN and other aid groups have rejected the new system, fearing it will exacerbate displacement and violate humanitarian principles.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's delay in rolling out 50% tariffs on the European Union, analysts warn that the potential for a trade war remains, causing uncertainty for investors. Trump's announcement followed a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, granting the two parties more time to negotiate. However, market watchers cautioned that a lot remains at stake, with the EU unlikely to capitulate to Trump's negotiating tactics. Uncertainty is bad for business and consumers, with no guarantee of de-escalation, market watchers say (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senior figures in British business report that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are being "rebranded" to avoid unwanted political attention. This shift comes amid a right-wing backlash against DEI efforts, with some organizations scaling back commitments and reducing public promotion of inclusion work. Despite this, experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act and legal risks. The trend reflects a broader effort to disguise DEI work while still addressing inequalities and promoting talent, particularly in US-headquartered firms.</p>

The tattoos, referential to those pan-European medieval invaders, have fueled IS propaganda dispersed on Rocket.Chat, a recruitment platform the terror group uses to communicate with its followers and recruits.

It emphasizes the need for new narratives that foreground nonhuman actors in order to slow this planetary cataclysm and examines the Rights of Nature movement, which seeks to grant basic rights to natural entities like rivers.</p>
