          <p>Broadcom's second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, with an adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 versus the expected $1.56 and revenue of $15 billion compared to the anticipated $14.99 billion. The company's net income rose significantly to $4.97 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.12 billion, or 44 cents per share, in the previous year. Broadcom anticipates approximately $15.8 billion in third-quarter revenue, exceeding analysts' projections of $15.70 billion, driven by strong demand for its custom AI chips from hyperscale partners.

          <p>The once-close relationship between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has dissolved into a public dispute, marked by personal attacks and disagreements over policy. The conflict ignited after Trump threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, in response to Musk's criticism of Trump's "big, beautiful bill". Musk retaliated by alleging, without evidence, that Trump is implicated in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, escalating the feud to a personal level. Their alliance, which saw Musk as a prominent Republican donor and advisor, has crumbled amid policy disagreements and mutual recriminations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his claims, without providing evidence, that former President Joe Biden's aides illicitly used an autopen to enact policies he did not support. Trump has directed the Justice Department and White House to investigate Biden's mental state while in office, asserting that the autopen usage constitutes a significant scandal. Biden has refuted these allegations, emphasizing that he made all decisions during his presidency and dismissing Trump's claims as a distraction.

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws in the United States protect all employees equally, regardless of their race, sexual orientation, or other group affiliations. The justices rejected the notion that majority group members must provide additional evidence of discrimination to pursue successful lawsuits. The ruling revives a case brought by Marlean Ames, who alleges she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor due to her heterosexual orientation. The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against any individual, regardless of their majority or minority status.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that a proposed increase in the child tax credit, as part of a domestic policy bill passed by the House, would exclude millions of low-income children from receiving the full benefit. While the bill raises the maximum child tax credit to $2,500, about a third of children would not qualify for the full credit due to their parents' low wages or unemployment. This limitation raises concerns about the bill's effectiveness in supporting the most vulnerable families and reducing child poverty.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new travel ban, restricting entry to the US for citizens of 12 countries and imposing partial restrictions on seven others. The ban cites national security concerns and risks of visa overstays as justifications for the policy. The new ban covers more countries and includes a wider range of justifications compared to previous iterations. The move is part of the administration's broader effort to implement stricter anti-immigration policies.</p>

There has been growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills for years while water companies have paid out £112m in rewards to executives over the past decade. The ban, which is backdated to April 2024, means regulator Ofwat can force firms to claw back bonuses that have been paid or face enforcement action.</p>
