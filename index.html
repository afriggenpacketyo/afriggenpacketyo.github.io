          <p>Ukraine reported the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, during a massive overnight Russian drone and missile attack. The Ukrainian air force stated that Ustimenko had shot down seven targets before his plane was damaged, and he heroically guided the damaged aircraft away from residential areas before crashing. The large-scale barrage involved over 500 drones and missiles targeting military-industrial sites and oil refineries, prompting neighboring Poland to scramble its own aircraft as a precaution. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mourned the pilot's death and reiterated urgent calls for more advanced air defense systems.</p>

          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey, Michael Testa, has introduced legislation to officially rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal appears inspired by President Trump's order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Testa, who represents a district bordering the bay, argues that New Jersey's robust fishing and tourism industries warrant the name change, stating it's time to "Make New Jersey Great Again." The bay has been named for its southern neighbor since 1610, and the proposal would require state agencies to update all official materials to reflect the new designation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly called for a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza conflict, urging the involved parties to "MAKE THE DEAL" and secure the return of hostages. His call comes amid signs of potential progress, with an Israeli official indicating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may soon visit Washington. Concurrently, Trump criticized the ongoing corruption trial against Netanyahu, labeling it a "POLITICAL WITCH HUNT" that interferes with ceasefire negotiations. The remarks represent a notable intervention in an ally's domestic legal affairs, while Israel also ordered new evacuations in northern Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent hostilities between Iran and Israel, a debate has emerged among officials, journalists, and historians on how to label the conflict, with President Trump suggesting the name "12-Day War." Experts note that official names for wars are often not the ones that stick, pointing to historical examples like the "Gulf War." Military historians question whether the recent flare-up even constitutes a formal war, viewing it as an escalation of a long-standing shadow conflict. The article also dismisses the "World War III" moniker, with specialists arguing that current global conflicts lack the scale and interconnectedness of past world wars.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase transparency, NPR has detailed its internal guidelines for using anonymous sources in its reporting. The organization states a strong preference for on-the-record sources but acknowledges that anonymity is sometimes necessary to protect individuals from significant harm, such as job loss or legal jeopardy, when they provide vital information. Before granting anonymity, senior editors conduct a rigorous vetting process to assess the source's credibility, the importance of their information, and the potential risks they face. When an unnamed source is used, NPR commits to explaining the reason for the anonymity to its audience.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are significantly impacting the U.S. bridal industry, where approximately 90% of wedding gowns are manufactured in China. Brides and boutique owners are facing surcharges and price increases of up to 30% on dresses, veils, and accessories, creating budget uncertainty and stress during wedding planning. Store owners struggle to price gowns ordered months in advance, as tariff rates remain volatile. The article notes that shifting production to the U.S. is not feasible due to a lack of skilled labor and higher costs, leading to more hesitation from brides and a slow buying season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a searchable national citizenship data system, integrating Social Security and immigration databases, to help election officials verify voter eligibility. The Department of Homeland Security's tool, an expansion of the SAVE program, aims to ensure only citizens are voting but has been developed without a public process, raising alarms among privacy advocates and legal experts. While some officials see potential benefits in easing the verification burden on voters, others worry about the accuracy of the data, potential for misuse, and the lack of transparency.

In contrast, only 38.1% of respondents wish for the Liberal Democratic Party and its partner, Komeito, to maintain control of the upper house. The survey, conducted ahead of the July 20 election, indicates significant public dissatisfaction, with rising prices being the top concern for nearly a third of voters.

          <p>Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium within a matter of months, despite recent US and Israeli attacks on its nuclear facilities. This assessment contradicts President Trump's claim that the program was set back by years, suggesting the damage was not total. Grossi expressed particular concern over the whereabouts of 400 kilograms of uranium already enriched to 60%, a level close to what is needed for a weapon. The situation is further complicated by Iran's recent decision to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, creating significant challenges for international monitoring.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of a 17-year-old TikTok star in Pakistan has intensified concerns about the safety of women who maintain a public online presence in the country. Many female influencers and content creators report facing a barrage of threats, online stalking that escalates into real-world encounters, and severe social backlash. The article highlights that patriarchal norms often frame women's public self-expression as a threat to cultural values, which can make harassment seem justified to perpetrators. While some platforms are improving safety features, many women feel that the systems in place are slow and ineffective.</p>

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, at least 81 Palestinians were killed and over 400 were injured in Israeli strikes across Gaza over a 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was being used as a shelter for displaced people, killing at least 11 individuals. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a "suspicious individual" in that area. The continued violence occurs as mediators intensify efforts for a new ceasefire and hostage deal, with hopes that the recent Israel-Iran truce could provide momentum, though negotiations reportedly remain stalled.</p>

          <p>The family of Blaze Bernstein, a gay, Jewish college student, faced his killer, Samuel Woodward, in a trial that concluded six years after the murder. Prosecutors argued Woodward, a member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, was motivated by hate, while the defense claimed the killing was a spontaneous act of rage. Woodward testified that Blaze had made an unwanted advance, a claim for which there is no evidence. The jury ultimately found Woodward guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement, resulting in a sentence of life in prison without parole. The case highlights the devastating impact of hate-fueled violence.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a major investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to build a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move is part of the EU's push for technological sovereignty, treating Eutelsat as a strategic asset for secure communications. However, industry experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, pointing to its vastly larger satellite constellation, manufacturing capacity, and launch access. While Eutelsat may succeed in niche government and enterprise markets, achieving mass-market parity with its American rival appears to be a long shot. (not investment advice)</p>

Maresca argued that such long stoppages are "not football" and disrupt the game's integrity, noting they are rare in European competitions.

          <p>Five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines. The move is a response to the perceived threat from Russia and is part of a broader strategy to create a heavily fortified border, described as a new "Iron Curtain." The plan involves producing and storing mines to be deployed quickly in an emergency, aiming to create a powerful deterrent. The decision is highly controversial, as critics warn that land mines are indiscriminate weapons that pose a long-term danger to civilians.</p>

The ban does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants. With over 30% of French adults still smoking, the government hopes these new restrictions, along with high taxes on cigarettes, will further reduce the country's smoking rate, which remains one of the highest in Europe.</p>
