IBM's stock also saw a gain of about 6% on the news. A paper expected next week will detail IBM's ability to run a quantum error-correction algorithm on AMD's chips, building on an existing agreement between the two companies to develop quantum computing capabilities. This development highlights renewed interest in the quantum space, boosting other related stocks like D-Wave Quantum and Rigetti Computing, as technology giants race to develop this advanced computing technology (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal bank fraud charges in Norfolk, Virginia, facing accusations she misrepresented a home's intended use to obtain a lower mortgage interest rate. James, a vocal antagonist of former President Trump, vehemently denies the charges, calling them a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of the justice system. Her legal team is challenging the legitimacy of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment, highlighting Halligan's past as a Trump lawyer and her unusual solo presentation of evidence to grand juries. The case adds another layer to the contentious relationship between James and Trump, following a significant civil fraud judgment against the Trump Organization in New York.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man, to Liberia, with the West African nation reportedly agreeing to accept him. This move comes as a federal judge in Maryland weighs his release from immigration custody. Abrego Garcia was previously wrongly deported to El Salvador, where he faced imprisonment despite having legal status protecting him from persecution. After being returned to the U.S. and indicted on human smuggling charges, he was re-detained by immigration authorities. The administration has struggled to find a country to accept him, with Liberia now designated, despite Abrego Garcia's fears of persecution if sent to other African nations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 11:40:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, boosting monthly payments for 71 million beneficiaries starting next year. This increase, higher than the previous year's 2.5%, reflects rising inflation, with the Consumer Price Index hitting 3% in September. While designed to protect purchasing power, advocacy groups like AARP argue the COLA falls short, as many seniors believe a 5% increase is needed to keep pace with daily expenses. Concerns are heightened by projected increases in Medicare premiums and deductibles for 2026, which could significantly diminish the benefit of the COLA for many retirees (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>U.S. inflation rose to 3% in September, a slight increase from August, which could complicate the trajectory of mortgage interest rates. While the Federal Reserve aims for 2% inflation and typically cuts rates as it declines, the current uptick may lead to a "wait and see" approach, despite high expectations for rate cuts in late 2025. Lenders, influenced by the Fed, might be reluctant to fully reflect anticipated 25-basis-point cuts if inflation continues to rise. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance are advised to consider locking in current rates, as waiting for rates to drop lower could be a costly mistake amidst evolving economic factors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Six men have been jailed for their roles in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse that provided aid to Ukraine, causing £1.3 million in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl, recruited by the proscribed Wagner Group, received a 17-year sentence for the "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" carried out in the interests of the Russian state. Earl, who was also plotting to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident, brought in other men to carry out the fire at the Ukrainian-owned facility. The warehouse had been used to send critical goods, including Starlink satellite terminals, to Ukraine, highlighting the broader geopolitical context of the attack.</p>

          <p>The average price of a new car reached a record $50,080 in September, marking the first time it has surpassed $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book. This surge was primarily driven by a rush to buy electric vehicles before a federal tax credit expired and increased luxury sales. With a 7.12% interest rate on a 60-month loan, a $50,080 car with 20% down translates to a $796 monthly payment, escalating to over $1,215 with fuel and insurance. For cost-conscious buyers, exploring used cars or leasing options, which offer lower monthly payments but come with mileage limits, is becoming increasingly attractive (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Inglewood High School's once-storied marching band has experienced a remarkable resurgence under the leadership of director Joseph Jauregui, known as Mr. J. Facing broken instruments, old uniforms, and only eight students upon his arrival, Jauregui tirelessly recruited and secured resources, growing the band to over 120 members. For students like sophomore Joan Rosas, who struggled academically, the band provides a crucial protective factor and a path to success, including scholarship opportunities at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Jauregui's dedication has not only restored the band's former glory but also transformed students' lives and academic prospects.</p>

          <p>The White House announced an upcoming summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30 in South Korea, following Trump's post-re-election trips to Malaysia and Japan. Expectations for the meeting are modest, with analysts anticipating limited concessions such as a pause in tariff escalation or minor agricultural purchases, rather than major breakthroughs. Experts warn of deep structural impasses that continue to drive strategic rivalry and confrontation between the two global powers, locking their relationship into a prolonged downward spiral. The summit is thus seen primarily as a necessary step towards de-escalation, reflecting the ongoing complexities and high stakes in U.S.-China relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With Americans facing record credit card debt, many worry about debt collection lawsuits, which can occur for surprisingly small amounts. There's no strict threshold, but collectors typically consider lawsuits for debts between $1,000 and $5,000, weighing potential recovery against legal costs and state laws. Unsecured debts like credit cards are more frequently litigated, while older debts beyond the statute of limitations cannot legally be sued for. To avoid legal action, individuals should proactively communicate with creditors, explore debt management programs, consider debt settlement for larger sums, or look into debt consolidation loans. Acting quickly is crucial to protect finances and prevent the long-term damage of a judgment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by strong demand in its beauty and grooming sectors. Despite this success, the company noted flat volume growth overall, indicating a slowdown in consumer demand for some products amidst inflation and a "K-shaped" economy where lower-income consumers are cutting back. P&G reiterated its fiscal 2026 sales and earnings forecast, adjusting expected tariff costs down to $400 million from $800 million due to rescinded Canadian retaliatory tariffs. However, President Trump's recent termination of all trade talks with Canada could introduce new cost uncertainties for the company (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant change for inherited IRAs in 2025 will require many non-spouse beneficiaries, like adult children, to begin taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) while still depleting the account within 10 years. This new IRS regulation, released in 2024, clarifies previous ambiguity and aims to avoid a 25% penalty for missed RMDs. Financial experts advise heirs to strategically plan withdrawals, potentially "playing the income tax bracket game" by taking distributions during lower-earning years to mitigate tax impacts. Understanding these changes is crucial for beneficiaries navigating the "great wealth transfer" and optimizing their tax situation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass appropriations bills to fund federal agencies by the October 1 deadline, leading to the cessation of non-essential functions. Under the Antideficiency Act, agencies must halt operations, with exceptions for protecting life and property, and constitutional processes. Essential employees, like air traffic controllers, continue working without pay, while non-essential staff are furloughed, though mass layoffs are now being considered for some programs. Historically, shutdowns, such as the 34-day event in 2018-2019, have cost billions and disrupted services, from national parks to immigration hearings, with the public's perception varying based on duration.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer confidence declined for the third consecutive month in October, with the University of Michigan's sentiment index falling to 53.6%, reflecting dimming economic views. Persistent inflation and a weakening labor market are key drivers, disproportionately affecting lower to median-income groups concerned about job and income prospects. Inflation expectations also crept higher, indicating ongoing strain from high prices, particularly among independents and Republicans. Despite the federal government shutdown, it appeared to have minimal direct impact on consumers' overall economic outlook, as indicated by the latest Consumer Price Index data, suggesting that the broader economic environment remains a primary concern.</p>

          <p>China's top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, has ratified October 25 as an annual day to commemorate Taiwan’s restoration to China. This date marks the surrender that ended Japan’s 50-year occupation of the island, which began in 1895 after China’s Qing government was defeated. Beijing asserts that establishing this commemoration day will "underscore the indisputable historical fact that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China" and strengthen international commitment to the "one-China principle." This move reinforces China's long-standing claim over Taiwan, a self-governing island where the Kuomintang fled in 1949 after losing the civil war to the communists.</p>
