          <p>Chinese researchers are working to address the underrepresentation of Southeast Asian populations in global genomic databases, a disparity highlighted by the Human Genome Project's focus on Western nations. The Kunming Institute of Zoology is leading a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams, resulting in the SEA3K data set, the first comprehensive genomic atlas of the region. The study has revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical environments and distinct Denisovan ancestry, with researchers emphasizing their adherence to local ethical protocols and community engagement during fieldwork. This effort seeks to rectify the historical oversight and provide a more inclusive understanding of human genetic diversity. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

          <p>A Harvard graduate's speech calling for unity in a divided world has sparked mixed reactions in both the United States and China. Jiang Yurong's address, delivered shortly after the U.S. vowed to "aggressively" revoke Chinese students' visas, emphasized the value of international classrooms and a shared humanity. While some praised her message as moving and representative of Chinese students' sentiments, others criticized her alleged links with the Chinese Communist Party and her elite background.

          <p>China refuted accusations from the Trump administration that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, countering that the U.S. is undermining the deal through export restrictions and visa revocations. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that these actions "seriously undermine" the agreement and vowed to take measures to protect China's interests. The spokesperson added that the U.S. has continued to "unilaterally provoke new economic and trade frictions, increasing the uncertainty and instability in the bilateral economic and trade relations". This escalation follows a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, which initially led to a temporary suspension of tariffs. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>

          <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts that the aviation industry will experience improved profitability in 2025, despite a projected slowdown in global GDP growth. The IATA forecasts increases in revenue, operating profits, and net profits, attributing these positive results to lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the year, while jet fuel costs are anticipated to decrease from $99 to $86 per barrel.

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. The victory represents a significant turnaround from initial exit polls, which had predicted a win for Trzaskowski, and is likely to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda.
