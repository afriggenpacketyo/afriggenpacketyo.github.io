          <p>One year after a near-fatal assassination attempt on former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly enhanced its security protocols. The agency is now deploying military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve aerial surveillance and ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, addressing key failures from the 2024 incident. Following an internal investigation that resulted in the suspension of six personnel, officials express confidence that these technological and procedural upgrades will prevent a repeat of the security lapses.</p>

          <p>A TUI flight from Cancun, Mexico, to London was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, after a fight broke out between two passengers. The diversion required all 267 passengers to spend the night in Maine, as the flight crew had timed out. U.S. Customs and Border Protection removed the two individuals involved, who faced no criminal charges but were sent back to their home countries on separate flights. The flight, a 787 Dreamliner, eventually continued its journey and landed safely at London's Gatwick Airport with a relief crew.</p>

          <p>President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited Kerrville, Texas, to survey the damage and meet with families affected by last week's deadly flash floods, which have claimed at least 121 lives. The president expressed the "anguish of our entire nation" after private meetings with grieving families and praised the efforts of first responders. The disaster, which heavily impacted a girls' summer camp, has left over 170 people missing as search efforts continue. Trump pledged federal support for rebuilding the region, acknowledging the immense and irreversible loss of life.</p>

          <p>Actor Derek Dixon has given his first interview since filing a $260 million lawsuit against producer Tyler Perry, alleging a sustained pattern of sexual harassment and assault. Dixon, who appeared in Perry's show "The Oval," claims Perry used his industry power to create a coercive environment and made repeated sexual advances. In the lawsuit, Dixon details multiple incidents of alleged sexual assault and claims his refusal to comply led to retaliation. Perry's attorney has denied the allegations, calling them a "scam," while Dixon states he hopes his actions will protect future actors.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing criticism over his strategy in trade negotiations with the United States, particularly after President Trump threatened a new 35% tariff on Canadian goods. Carney, who won the election promising a tough stance, has made several concessions, including scrapping a planned digital services tax, which some commentators argue have yielded little in return. While the government maintains it is defending Canadian interests in a difficult negotiation with an unpredictable U.S. administration, the outcome of the ongoing talks will be a significant political test for the new prime minister.</p>

The author sarcastically suggests that going to space is an outdated "60s" concept and that the new leadership is appropriate for an agency that is being dismantled rather than one aiming for new frontiers. The piece critiques the current administration's priorities, humorously proposing that funds saved from space exploration could be used for other political goals, framing the decline of NASA as a bleak national metaphor.</p>

          <p>The grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol will soon feature a statue of Robert Smalls, a formerly enslaved man who became a Civil War hero and U.S. congressman. This monument will be the first honoring a Black man at the Capitol, joining existing statues that predominantly commemorate white figures with ties to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. The addition of the Smalls statue represents a significant and historic step toward a more inclusive representation of the state's history. The brief audio report highlights this important cultural and commemorative event.</p>

          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has strongly criticized the Trump administration's decision to cut off funding and effectively dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Gates called the effects "devastating" but "entirely preventable," highlighting reports from aid workers of critical shortages in HIV medication for children and other essential supplies. The Gates Foundation has been a long-time partner of USAID, and Gates warned that the abrupt cuts are interrupting medical trials and leaving life-saving medicines in warehouses. He emphasized that it is not too late for the administration to reverse its course.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of notorious drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in a Chicago court. As part of the plea deal, Guzman Lopez admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation for the Sinaloa cartel's "Los Chapitos" faction. He has agreed to forfeit $80 million in assets and must provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could involve testifying against other cartel members, including his own brother. This guilty plea marks a significant development in U.S. efforts to prosecute the leaders of the powerful cartel.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, a remarkable achievement two years after taking an indefinite break from the sport due to burnout and mental health struggles. Once a teenage prodigy, the 23-year-old stepped away from tennis in 2023, stating the pressure had become unbearable. Her return to the tour was challenging, but her run at Wimbledon, including a semifinal win over the world's top-ranked player, marks a powerful comeback. Anisimova said it feels special to prove that prioritizing one's well-being can lead back to the top.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. has overturned a plea agreement that would have allowed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and his co-defendants to avoid the death penalty. The 2-1 decision sided with the Defense Secretary, who had argued he had the authority to revoke the deal to ensure the defendants face a full military trial. The plea deal, which would have resulted in life sentences, had divided the families of 9/11 victims and has been complicated for years by legal questions surrounding the torture the defendants endured in U.S. custody.</p>

          <p>Civil rights advocates and protesters are accusing Los Angeles law enforcement of improperly using less-lethal weapons during recent anti-ICE demonstrations, causing serious injuries. A civil rights claim has been filed on behalf of one man whose finger was amputated by a flash-bang device, alleging a pattern of "militarized violence" against peaceful protesters. Critics argue that officers are violating their own policies and state law, which restrict the use of such weapons and prohibit aiming them at the head or firing indiscriminately into crowds, echoing concerns raised after the 2020 George Floyd protests.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India crash that killed 260 people indicates the jet's fuel cutoff switches were moved moments after takeoff, starving the engines. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they had cut the fuel, with the other denying they had done so. Although fuel flow was restored seconds later, the Boeing 787 did not have sufficient altitude to recover, crashing shortly after. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau focuses on pilot actions, as there is currently no evidence of mechanical failure.</p>
