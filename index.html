          <p>Two female tourists, a 68-year-old from the UK and a 67-year-old from New Zealand, were killed by an elephant during a guided safari walk in Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. According to local police, the women were trampled by a nursing female elephant that charged them from behind. Efforts by tour guides to deter the animal by firing shots were unsuccessful, and both women died at the scene. This incident follows two separate fatal elephant attacks on American tourists in Zambia last year, prompting authorities to reiterate warnings for tourists to exercise extreme caution around wildlife, especially protective mothers with their young.</p>

          <p>An ongoing strike by French air traffic controllers has led to significant travel disruptions across Europe, grounding approximately 40% of flights at all Paris airports. The strike, initiated by unions seeking better working conditions and protesting new reform measures, has forced airlines like Ryanair to cancel hundreds of flights, affecting tens of thousands of passengers at the start of the busy summer travel season. Despite some preventive cancellations requested by the national civil aviation authority, major delays are still expected at all French airports. The transport minister has called the union's decision to strike during the peak holiday period "unacceptable."</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, has announced her resignation from the UK's Labour Party, stating her intention to form a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who has been sitting as an independent since being stripped of the Labour whip, cited the current government's stance on Gaza, poverty, and welfare as key reasons for her departure. In a social media post, she criticized the political establishment for failing to improve people's lives and for what she termed its participation in genocide. While Corbyn has hinted at such a move, he has not officially confirmed his involvement in the new party.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States turns inward and retreats from the global order it once led, the rest of the world is declaring its own independence from American influence. The author, writing from a Canadian perspective, contends that America's recent political trajectory has forced allies to forge new paths, creating new trade partnerships and security arrangements independent of the U.S. The piece suggests that America's internal divisions and abandonment of its traditional role have rendered it an unreliable partner, forcing other nations to navigate a new geopolitical landscape without relying on its leadership, a shift the author views as an accidental revolution.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles' Pacific Palisades, a preservation effort named Project Chimney is working to salvage the remaining chimneys from architecturally significant homes destroyed by recent wildfires. Led by artist Evan Hall, the non-profit initiative aims to relocate and preserve these structures, some designed by modern masters like Richard Neutra, as part of a future community memorial. The team is facing a tight deadline from the Army Corps of Engineers, which is managing the debris cleanup. Despite logistical and financial challenges, the project has successfully moved several large chimney sections, preserving what they see as profound symbols of the community's loss and memory.</p>

          <p>This article argues that in the current climate of intense criticism from both the left and right, Americans have forgotten the core justifications for liberal democracy. It revisits the ideas of philosopher Isaiah Berlin, who championed "value pluralism"—the concept that legitimate human values are diverse and often incompatible, meaning no single utopian vision can be perfect. This inherent tension, Berlin argued, is why freedom of choice is paramount, as it allows individuals and societies to navigate these trade-offs. The essay suggests that embracing this understanding is crucial for defending democracy against totalitarian thinking and appreciating the value of differing perspectives.</p>

The company faces intense competition from rivals like Walmart and Costco, and the failed merger has forced it to re-evaluate its strategy for growth and competitiveness in the challenging grocery market.

          <p>India's aviation watchdog, the DGCA, reprimanded Air India Express in March for failing to perform timely engine part replacements on an Airbus A320 as mandated by a European safety directive. A confidential government memo revealed the budget carrier not only missed the deadline but also allegedly falsified maintenance records to conceal the lapse. The required modification was to address a potential unsafe condition that could lead to engine failure and debris release. Air India Express acknowledged the error, attributing it to a software migration issue, and stated it has since taken remedial action, including administrative changes.</p>

          <p>The states that rely on the shrinking Colorado River are approaching a critical federal deadline to agree on a new deal for sharing its dwindling water resources. The river serves as a vital water source for approximately 40 million people and irrigates vast agricultural lands across the American West. As climate change exacerbates drought conditions, securing a sustainable and equitable long-term plan has become increasingly urgent. Negotiations have been complex, but there is now a possibility that the states will reach a consensus on a potential framework before the deadline passes, which would be a significant step toward managing the water crisis.</p>

          <p>Residents of Seoul and surrounding areas in South Korea are being plagued by massive swarms of insects known as lovebugs, with experts attributing the outbreaks to rising temperatures from climate change. These bugs, which get their name from flying in conjoined pairs, are not harmful to humans but have become a major public nuisance, covering hiking trails and buildings. First detected in the country in 2015, their population has surged, prompting the government to dispatch workers to manage the outbreak. While officials note the bugs are ecologically beneficial, public complaints have more than doubled in the past year.</p>

          <p>A growing number of cities across the United States, including Salt Lake City and Sarasota, are replacing traditional Fourth of July fireworks with synchronized drone light shows. The shift is primarily driven by safety concerns, such as reducing wildfire risks in drought-prone areas, and environmental considerations. Proponents also highlight that the quieter drone displays are more inclusive for individuals with PTSD and pets sensitive to loud noises. While some communities have pushed back, preferring the "boom" of pyrotechnics, the drone show industry is experiencing a surge in popularity, offering elaborate, choreographed displays set to music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In observance of the Fourth of July, NPR compiled responses from over 300 everyday people on what freedom means to them in contemporary America. The definitions were diverse, with some equating freedom with a sense of safety from poverty, violence, and political corruption. Others defined it as the right to self-determination, including the ability to choose one's life path without government interference. A common theme was the idea that personal freedom comes with a responsibility to others and that true freedom cannot exist unless it is extended to everyone in society, regardless of their background.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff, the U.S. dollar is experiencing its worst start to a year in half a century, a trend accelerated by President Trump's trade policies. The U.S. dollar index has fallen significantly, making imports more expensive for Americans and raising concerns among global investors about the nation's budget deficit and protectionist measures. Rogoff, a former IMF chief economist, notes that this weakening could mark a major inflection point in global economics, potentially diminishing the dollar's long-held dominance as the world's primary reserve currency.

The minister, Tony Burke, stated that while Ye had been visiting the country for a long time, his visa was canceled after the song's release because Australia does not need to "deliberately import bigotry." The song, which praises Adolf Hitler, has been banned on multiple platforms. Ye, who is married to Australian Bianca Censori, has a history of making antisemitic remarks, and the minister confirmed he no longer holds a valid visa to enter the country.</p>
