          <p>Israel has launched an attack on Iranian state television and issued evacuation warnings to hundreds of thousands of residents in Tehran, following accusations that Iran targeted civilians in prior strikes. The Israeli military claims that Iranian missiles have killed at least 24 people and injured hundreds more, accusing Tehran of deliberately targeting population centers. In response, Israel says it struck over 120 surface-to-surface missile launchers in Iran, focusing on the Quds Force. The U.S. State Department has raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, urging citizens not to travel there due to the ongoing armed conflict and civil unrest. Optimism about the situation is low given the escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made limited progress in bridging tariff gaps during their summit, raising doubts about a swift agreement that would protect Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any potential deal should serve the interests of both nations and that ministerial talks will continue. The U.S. has granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from reciprocal tariffs, but it remains uncertain whether this pause will be extended. The auto sector remains a key point of contention due to the importance of the United States as a critical market for Japanese automakers. The prospect of a mutually beneficial resolution remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump is cutting his trip to Canada short, returning to Washington due to escalating tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. This decision follows airstrikes and missile attacks traded between the two nations, marking a significant escalation in their decades-long conflict. Trump affirmed that he was aware of messages from Iran indicating a desire to de-escalate the conflict, but insisted they should have pursued a deal earlier. The U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive, but has helped intercept Iranian missiles and warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region, showcasing the complexities of the U.S. position.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is cautioning patients against filming their medical treatments for platforms like TikTok and Instagram, citing risks to both themselves and NHS staff. Concerns include staff distraction, discomfort, and the potential exposure of private medical data of other individuals in the hospital environment. One radiographer described an incident where a patient's relative began filming during treatment setup, while another recounted a patient covertly recording staff for a cancer blog.

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has incurred nearly $20 million in expenses related to recent protests over federal immigration raids, according to the city's top budget analyst. The LAPD has spent $16.9 million, including $11.7 million on overtime, while repairs to City Hall and other buildings cost $780,601. Protests have been ongoing since immigration agents raided a fast-fashion warehouse on June 6, with some demonstrations turning violent, leading to 575 arrests. The financial strain from these protests adds to the city's existing budget challenges, including rising legal payouts and declining tax revenues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to recent immigration raids conducted by masked federal officers, California lawmakers have introduced a bill to prohibit law enforcement from concealing their faces while on duty. The proposed law would make it a misdemeanor for local, state, and federal officers to cover their faces, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons, while also encouraging the display of identification. Supporters argue this promotes transparency and accountability, while critics, including the Department of Homeland Security, contend it endangers officers by making them identifiable targets. The proposal has sparked debate over balancing public transparency with officer safety in law enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on the global arms export market, driven by security concerns and a desire to deepen ties with allies. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has expressed interest in promoting Japan's defense exports, signaling a shift in policy previously restricted to domestic needs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's attendance at a defense exhibition further underscores this change. This move aims to improve interoperability with partner nations and bolster Japan's defense industrial base, which has faced challenges due to reliance on U.S. weapons imports.

          <p>Riverside Police are seeking the public's help in identifying the driver of a black SUV who drove through a group of demonstrators, critically injuring a 21-year-old woman, Alexa Carrasco. The incident occurred during a “No Kings” rally and a demonstration against immigration raids. Friends say Carrasco was loving, outgoing, and proud to be using her voice at the protest. Investigators are trying to determine if the incident was intentional or politically motivated, as the driver fled the scene after running over Carrasco.

The plaintiffs argue that the LAPD's actions interfere with the constitutional and statutory rights of journalists reporting on these events.
