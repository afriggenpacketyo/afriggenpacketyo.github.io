          <p>US Ambassador Mike Huckabee visited a Christian village in the occupied West Bank following an arson attack on an ancient Byzantine-era church. Residents blame Israeli settlers for the fire, which is part of a surge in violence in the region since the Israel-Hamas war began. Huckabee condemned the desecration of a place of worship, expressed solidarity with the community, and insisted that the perpetrators must be found and prosecuted for their acts of terror and violence. The visit highlights escalating tensions and attacks on Palestinian communities and property.</p>

          <p>Andy Byron, the CEO of data company Astronomer, has resigned after a video of him in an intimate moment with the company's head of human resources went viral. The footage, captured on the "kiss cam" at a Coldplay concert, showed the married CEO and his colleague reacting awkwardly, prompting the lead singer to joke about a possible affair. Following a formal investigation and being placed on leave, Byron's resignation was accepted by the board, which stated that the company's leadership standards were not met. The company is now searching for a new chief executive.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in Westbury, New York, after being pulled into an active MRI machine. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain, which was attracted by the powerful magnetic field of the device, causing a fatal medical episode. Police are investigating the incident, which highlights the critical safety protocols required in MRI environments. The FDA warns that strong magnetic fields can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles, necessitating careful screening of all people and items entering the magnet area.</p>

          <p>The LA Clippers are actively considering bringing veteran point guard Chris Paul back to the franchise, according to president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank. Frank praised Paul as a "great player" and "great Clipper," noting his playmaking abilities would fit the team's strategy. At 40, Paul played all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs last season and would join a guard-heavy roster including James Harden and Bradley Beal. The team believes adding more playmakers will help manage the workload for its aging stars and enhance roster versatility for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>After years of rapid growth, the popularity of learning Mandarin is waning in the United States and other Western nations. University enrollments for Mandarin in the US have dropped by 25% from their 2013 peak, with similar declines observed in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This "huge shift" reflects changing geopolitical perceptions and career incentives that once positioned Mandarin as the language of the future. While interest is still growing modestly in some European countries, it is being outpaced by other, more popular languages.</p>

The announcement comes after data showed serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high, while water company executives received millions in bonuses.

          <p>Former President Trump has filed a $20 billion libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges defamation over an article that reported on a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein from the early 2000s, which the paper claimed was signed by Trump and included a drawing of a nude woman. Trump has denied the report, calling the letter a "FAKE." The lawsuit faces a high legal bar, as public figures must prove "actual malice" to win defamation cases in the U.S.</p>

A strange moment occurred when his shot from the rough dislodged a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey, but he quickly recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the next hole. The crowd at Portrush roared with support as the Northern Irishman shot a 66, leaving him six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler.

          <p>On the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, Germany remembers the conspirators of "Operation Valkyrie." The plot, led by officer Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, failed when the bomb only minorly injured Hitler, leading to the swift execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 other resistance fighters. The article reflects on the legacy of the plotters, who were initially seen as traitors but are now honored as heroes. It also notes the historical debate surrounding their motivations and that they were not primarily driven by democratic ideals.</p>

          <p>Following significant public pressure, President Trump has called for the release of grand jury testimony related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department has formally filed a motion to unseal the records, citing public interest but noting victim-related information would be redacted. Trump, however, dismissed those calling for transparency as "troublemakers," suggesting nothing would satisfy them. The move comes as lawmakers from both parties have demanded the release of the files, arguing it is crucial for government trust and transparency.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, are accusing Manhattan prosecutors of illegally obtaining his confidential medical records. The defense claims the DA's office used a "fraudulent subpoena" to compel Aetna to turn over the HIPAA-protected information. Prosecutors contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent additional materials in error, which were then deleted. Mangione's attorneys are requesting a hearing and have suggested that sanctions, potentially including dismissal of the charges, should be considered for the alleged misconduct.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing sanctions on a Brazilian Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former leader Jair Bolsonaro. The Trump administration placed visa restrictions on Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing a case against Bolsonaro for allegedly trying to overturn the 2022 election. Lula described the US action as "unacceptable" interference in another country's justice system and a violation of national sovereignty. The move by the US is the latest in a series of actions taken in support of its ally, Bolsonaro.</p>

His aggressive and relentless play set the tone early and was a key factor in the Lions building a commanding lead.

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during protests against the government's decision to ban the activist group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. Demonstrations took place in several major cities, with protesters holding placards expressing support for the group, which led to arrests for suspected terrorism offenses. The government proscribed Palestine Action earlier this month after its members broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. The ban makes it a criminal offense to support the group, and a legal challenge to the decision is scheduled.</p>
