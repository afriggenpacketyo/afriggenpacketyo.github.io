        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is hopeful that a government shutdown can be prevented as the deadline for a spending agreement approaches. He emphasized the Democratic goal of finding bipartisan common ground to fund the government and address the needs of the American people, particularly regarding health and economic well-being. A key point of contention remains the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats are pushing to secure before notices of their expiration are sent out. Both Democratic and Republican leaders, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, have expressed a desire to avoid a shutdown, with a meeting scheduled at the White House to continue negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime real estate. The national shopping center vacancy rate increased to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2025, leading to a softening of rent growth and allowing entrepreneurs like wellness practitioners and boutique owners to negotiate more favorable lease terms. Landlords are becoming more open to non-traditional tenants to keep their properties active, offering flexible leases and other incentives. While this trend provides a lifeline for small businesses, experts note that the opportunities vary geographically and landlords still weigh the risks associated with less established tenants.

          <p>David Kaczynski, who identified his brother Ted Kaczynski as the Unabomber, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of Ted's bombs in 1987. The article explores the complex history of Ted Kaczynski, from his traumatic childhood hospitalization to his participation in a controversial Harvard psychological study, which may have contributed to his anti-social behavior. After turning his brother in, a guilt-ridden David began reaching out to victims to apologize, leading to his connection with Wright. Their shared journey of healing and forgiveness offers a powerful narrative of compassion emerging from profound tragedy, demonstrating that reconciliation is possible even in the most extreme circumstances.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation highlights the growing problem of AI-powered "nudify" applications that allow users to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes of individuals with minimal effort. The report follows a group of Minnesota women who discovered a male friend had used their social media photos to generate such content, causing significant emotional trauma. Because the images were not distributed and the victims were adults, no laws were broken, exposing a critical gap in current legislation. These women are now advocating for a state bill to penalize the services that enable this form of digital abuse, drawing attention to the real-world harm caused by the rapid, unregulated advancement of AI technology.</p>

          <p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg has rejected claims that her participation in a Gaza-bound humanitarian aid flotilla is merely a publicity stunt, stating that no one would risk their life for attention. Speaking from a vessel off the Greek coast, Thunberg asserted the mission's purpose is to break what she calls Israel's illegal siege and deliver essential supplies to a population facing famine. The flotilla has recently faced drone attacks, which Thunberg attributes to baseless threats from Israeli officials intended to intimidate the peaceful mission. She emphasized that the effort sends a message of solidarity, showing that when governments fail to act, ordinary people will step up to help.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain mindsets prevent people from increasing their earnings, even when they desire to do so. He identifies three limiting beliefs: feeling that one should already know how to manage money, expecting that talent alone should make success easy, and procrastinating by telling oneself they will start later. Sethi emphasizes that financial management is a learned skill and that achieving goals requires patience, systems, and consistent action rather than waiting for an effortless or perfect moment. Overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward taking practical actions like negotiating a raise or starting a side business to improve financial security.

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan, identifying Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The initiative aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, drawing inspiration from the post-war Labour government's successful new town developments. However, the plan faces challenges, including rising costs for housebuilders and concerns from local communities who feel they have not been consulted on the large-scale developments.</p>

          <p>A viral social media trend suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the feet before bed can improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels, but health experts remain skeptical. Dermatologists and sleep psychologists point to a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through the skin, especially the thick skin on the soles of the feet, to produce systemic effects. Experts suggest any perceived benefits are more likely due to the relaxing effects of a nightly foot massage routine rather than the magnesium itself. They recommend focusing on evidence-based sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consistent schedule and creating a dark, quiet environment, for more reliable results.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Doug LaMalfa, a staunch Trump ally in a conservative northern California district, is facing a significant political challenge due to a new redistricting proposal. The plan, which voters will decide on in a special election, aims to create five new Democratic-leaning seats in response to gerrymandering in other states and could put LaMalfa's seat at risk. The battle comes as the congressman faces growing frustration from some constituents over his policy stances, which was evident at a recent tense town hall meeting.

With the integrity of future elections at risk, the piece calls for a coherent strategy to challenge unlawful assertions of executive power and protect the rule of law before it is further undermined.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the persistent threat of fires in cities, the United States has seen remarkable progress in fire safety over the past 40 years. Since 1980, the per-capita civilian fire death rate has been reduced by approximately two-thirds, and the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This success is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements in public safety measures and building codes. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, the increased use of automatic sprinkler systems, safer furniture materials, a dramatic decrease in smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety standards, all of which have collectively saved countless lives.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is scheduled for sentencing after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution earlier this year. While he was acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, he still faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. The convictions relate to orchestrating and paying for travel for sexual encounters involving his girlfriends and male sex workers, which falls under the federal Mann Act. Prosecutors are recommending a sentence of at least four to five years, whereas Combs's defense team is arguing for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which would mean his immediate release due to time already served.</p>

          <p>Facing historically low approval ratings and a surge in support for the right-wing Reform UK party, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has urged his Labour Party to unite and focus on its political opponents. Speaking ahead of the party's annual conference, Starmer acknowledged the steep challenge ahead, with polls showing only 13% of voters are satisfied with his leadership. The government has been beset by high-profile resignations and controversy over unpopular policies, leading to internal criticism and questions about his decision-making. Starmer defended his record and attacked Reform's policies as racist, framing the upcoming period as a critical fight for the party's future.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is actively considering taking equity stakes and providing price floors for domestic critical mineral companies to secure supply chains and counter China's market dominance. Following a deal to support rare earth miner MP Materials, the administration is now looking at similar arrangements for other key resources like lithium, with Lithium Americas being a potential target. Industry leaders argue that federal support, particularly price guarantees, is essential to de-risk private investment in a market historically manipulated by Chinese price suppression. This strategic shift away from free-market ideals signals a new willingness to use industrial policy to protect national security and economic interests. (not investment advice)</p>

The loan is intended to ensure cash flows through the supply chain, protecting thousands of jobs at JLR's plants and at the numerous smaller firms that depend on its operations.

          <p>This article posits that jury nullification, a historic legal mechanism, may become a vital tool for ordinary citizens to resist what are perceived as politically motivated prosecutions. Jury nullification occurs when a jury acquits a defendant, not because they are innocent, but because the jury believes the law itself is unjust or its application is tyrannical. While it has a controversial history, particularly its use by all-white juries to protect perpetrators of lynchings, it was also used by abolitionists to free escaped slaves. The author suggests that as the Justice Department is increasingly used to target political opponents, citizens serving on juries have the right and power to refuse to convict in cases they deem to be corruptions of the law.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck as she slept. In a 911 call, Benjamin claimed he thought he was dreaming and later told authorities he was sleepwalking, a defense supported by a family history of the condition. Prosecutors, unable to find any motive or evidence of conflict between the deeply close siblings, remain skeptical. A sleep disorder expert who studied Benjamin believes he was in a state of slow-wave sleep and killed his sister unintentionally.

The piece highlights the forcible transfer of individuals to a prison in El Salvador as a key example of lawless executive action. It further asserts that the Supreme Court has enabled this crisis by gutting the power of judicial injunctions, effectively removing a critical check on the executive branch and creating a reality where the government can act illegally with impunity.</p>

Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing its creation in the historical period after European contact.

          <p>A report from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has claimed that the country's J-35 stealth fighter jet has a radar cross-section (RCS) smaller than a human palm. The RCS is a critical measure of an aircraft's detectability by radar, and this claim suggests a high degree of low-observability for the new fighter. The broadcast attributed the J-35's stealth capabilities to its unique airframe design and proprietary metamaterial technology. For comparison, the report noted that the American F-35 fighter is said to have an RCS of about 15cm², roughly the size of a golf ball, implying the J-35 may have a significant stealth advantage.</p>
