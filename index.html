          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is positioning his company to lead an artificial intelligence revolution, believing AI will be 10,000 times smarter than humans within a decade. Building on his historic success with a $20 million investment in Alibaba, Son is now driving massive investments into AI-related firms like chip designer Arm and OpenAI. This AI-centric strategy is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor, following a period where his Vision Fund faced significant losses on other tech ventures, but Son believes it is fundamental to SoftBank's long-term survival and success.</p>

          <p>Five Al Jazeera journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike near Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital, an attack the broadcaster condemned as a "targeted assassination." The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later confirmed it had struck one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative. This event highlights the extreme dangers faced by media workers in the conflict, as international outlets rely heavily on local Gazan journalists for coverage. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 186 journalists have been killed in the region since October 2023.</p>

          <p>A group of former national security and intelligence officials has publicly condemned the recent firings of several FBI agents by Director Kash Patel, calling it a politically motivated "purge." In a letter, the group claims the agents were targeted for not being loyal to President Trump, transforming the FBI into a "personal enforcement arm." The FBI's dismissal notices cited reasons such as poor judgment and the political weaponization of the government. This move has intensified concerns about the bureau's independence under the current administration.</p>

          <p>A fire at an AT&T communications center in Gardena temporarily disrupted the 911 system in nearby Redondo Beach. The blaze, which started as a trash fire, spread to the facility and ignited lead-acid batteries, creating a toxic situation that required a Hazmat team and a shelter-in-place order for local residents. More than 100 firefighters responded to the five-hour fire. Redondo Beach police confirmed the 911 outage was intermittent and had minimal impact, and no injuries were reported from the incident.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is the only way to defeat Hamas and secure the release of remaining hostages. He asserted that Israel's goal is not occupation but the demilitarization of Gaza, followed by the establishment of a non-Israeli civilian administration. The plan has sparked widespread international condemnation and fears of exacerbating the severe humanitarian crisis, but Netanyahu affirmed Israel would proceed "with or without the support of others."</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, a clear sign of climate change that is causing dramatic shifts in marine life. This warming trend has led to an influx of unusual species like octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish into UK waters. While these new arrivals are remarkable, scientists warn that the heat is pushing cold-adapted native species like cod to their limits. The changes pose significant challenges to the UK's marine ecosystems and traditional fishing communities.</p>

          <p>A violent attack in Santa Lucia, Ecuador, left eight people dead and two others injured after gunmen in pickup trucks opened fire on a crowd outside a nightclub. The incident occurred in the Guayas province, which is under a state of emergency due to rampant gang violence. Among the victims was the nightclub's owner, who was also the brother of the town's mayor. Police are investigating the motive for the mass shooting, which contributes to a significant increase in homicides in the country this year.</p>

Researchers found that damaging the delicate tissue inside the nose allowed certain bacteria a more direct route to the brain.

While the findings are preliminary and require human studies for confirmation, they offer a new avenue for understanding the disease's environmental triggers.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger boat, the Discovery, ran aground in powerful waves near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor. Dramatic videos captured the vessel being tossed by high surf, appearing to nearly capsize before it came to rest against a shoreline wall. The two experienced crew members on board were not injured. The boat's owner, Atlantis Adventures, is working with authorities to safely remove the vessel and has taken precautions by removing fuel and batteries to prevent any environmental pollution.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire burning on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples has forced Italian authorities to close all hiking trails within the Vesuvius National Park. Firefighters, supported by the army and six water-bombing planes, are battling the blaze which has consumed over 1,200 acres of forest. While the smoke is visible from the nearby archeological site of Pompeii, the ruins remain open to tourists. An investigation has been launched into the cause of the fire, which poses a threat to the region's unique ecosystem and farms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering new tariffs on Chinese goods in response to Beijing's ongoing purchases of Russian oil. Vice President J.D. Vance stated that President Trump is reviewing his options but has not made a final decision. The potential move is seen as another lever to exert pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, though the White House acknowledges the complexity of the U.S.-China economic relationship and the wide-ranging effects such tariffs could have.

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas are facing criticism for cultural appropriation over a new shoe design. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was inspired by traditional Mexican leather sandals called huaraches, but it was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous Oaxacan communities who created the original design. Following backlash, which included comments from Mexico's president, Chavarria issued a public apology for not developing the shoe in partnership with the community, and Adidas has removed promotional images.</p>

          <h2>Report Details Intensified Israeli Settler Campaign to Displace West Bank Palestinians</h2>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank have significantly intensified their campaign to displace Palestinians since the October 7 attacks. Supported by hardline nationalist ministers in the Israeli government, settlers are expanding outposts and using violence and intimidation to seize land, with the stated goal of ensuring the territory has no future for Palestinians. Human rights groups and UN experts report a systemic pattern of violations, accusing Israeli security forces of failing to protect Palestinians and, in some cases, actively participating in the aggression.</p>
