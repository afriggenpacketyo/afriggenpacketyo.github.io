          <p>A lion killed a 59-year-old businessman, Bernd Kebbel, at a luxury safari lodge in Namibia after he left his tent to use the toilet. Kebbel was camping with his wife and friends near Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp when the attack occurred early in the morning. Other campers scared off the lion, but Kebbel had already died. The incident marks at least the second deadly lion attack in Africa in less than six weeks, highlighting the dangers of human-wildlife conflict in the region, especially as lion populations face challenges due to drought and prey scarcity. This event underscores the risks associated with camping in areas inhabited by wild animals. The optimism score for this event is low due to the tragic loss of life.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Istanbul for another round of U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending Russia's invasion. These talks follow a surprise drone attack by Ukraine on strategic bomber bases deep inside Russian territory, which Moscow framed as a terrorist act. Ukraine is calling for a full 30-day ceasefire during negotiations, but Russia has refused, maintaining maximalist war goals. President Zelenskyy has accused Putin of sabotaging peace talks, while Trump's administration expresses growing frustration with Moscow's unreasonableness. The ongoing drone and missile attacks highlight the continued intensity of the conflict, with both sides accusing each other of escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>New York City has experienced the fewest shootings and murders in recorded history during the first five months of the year, according to city officials. From January through May, there were 264 recorded shootings and 112 recorded homicides, marking new lows. Mayor Eric Adams attributed these achievements to the administration's commitment to precision policing, strategic resource deployment, and investments in young New Yorkers. The police have also removed roughly 22,000 illegal guns from the city's streets. The NYPD reported an overall crime index dip of nearly 3% last year, with sizable reductions in cases of murder, robbery, burglary, grand larceny, and motor vehicle theft.</p>

          <p>WorldPride is coming to Washington, D.C., amid mixed emotions due to the Trump administration's policies targeting the LGBTQ community. Some community members fear for their safety, while others view it as an opportunity to take a stand. Those with layered identities, such as people of color, face additional complexities. Safety protocols are in place, but some Pride events have been canceled or relocated. Despite concerns, many are determined to show up and support the community, while others prioritize their emotional and physical safety. There are also ways to "show up" for the community without being in Washington physically, including supporting local Pride events and LGBT centers.</p>

          <p>As the Senate debates President Donald Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package, there could be changes to the child tax credit, policy experts say. If enacted as drafted, the House-approved bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed via Trump's 2017 tax cuts — which could otherwise revert to $1,000 after 2025 without action from Congress. The highest credit would also rise to $2,500 from 2025 to 2028. After that, the credit's top value would revert to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethics of enforcing rules against AI-generated writing, as students increasingly view it as acceptable. The real value of a humanities education is questioned, shifting from product-based outcomes to the cultivation of character and practical wisdom. The advent of AI threatens to short-circuit this process by removing cognitive friction, which is essential for developing reasoning skills. A proposed solution involves allowing students to use AI but requiring them to reflect on its impact on their learning process.

Speakers criticized President Trump and urged Democrats to fight for their principles. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz delivered a thorough speech, critiquing both Trump and his own party for being feckless and off-putting. Despite the bluster, an air of anxiety pervaded the convention, with many acknowledging the party's need for repair. Delegates expressed the need for change and a return to focusing on people's pocketbooks, yet confidence in the party's future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>California is considering a bill that would mandate phonics-based reading instruction in schools, marking a shift from the long-standing "whole language" approach. The bill aims to improve reading scores, which have been below the national average, by requiring districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading." This approach emphasizes phonemic awareness, phonics, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The bill has gained support from teachers unions and advocacy groups, with compromises to allow districts flexibility in selecting materials and teacher training. Early results from districts that have adopted structured phonics learning show significant gains in reading test scores.</p>

          <p>California legislators are considering significant changes to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark state environmental law. Two proposals aim to streamline the law for urban housing developments and weaken rules for other projects. Governor Newsom supports these changes, aiming to expedite approval as part of the state budget. CEQA requires proponents to disclose and lessen environmental effects, but it has also been criticized for delaying housing and infrastructure projects. These changes could restrict community groups' ability to shape development and reduce transparency in environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>California native plant landscapes can sometimes appear drab, especially in the summer when many plants go dormant. However, with careful planning, native plants can bring vibrant color to a garden while supporting local birds and pollinators. Experts recommend plants like California goldenrod, desert marigold, and California buckwheat for yellows, creams, and whites. For reds and oranges, consider Hollywood Flame Hummingbird Fuchsia and desert globemallow, and for purples and blues, woolly bluecurls and celestial blue sage are excellent choices. These plants not only add beauty but also thrive in California's climate and support local ecosystems.</p>

          <p>California is developing new wildfire protection regulations that would prohibit almost all plants and other combustible material within 5 feet of homes, known as "Zone 0." Scientists argue that well-maintained plants and trees can protect homes from wind-blown embers and slow fire spread. Research suggests that surviving plants often appear scorched on the side facing a burned structure, indicating that homes ignited first. The proposed regulations oversimplify complex conditions and go beyond current scientific research regarding plant flammability. The emphasis on vegetation removal, instead of maintenance and home hardening, could be counterproductive in reducing fire risk.</p>

The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.
