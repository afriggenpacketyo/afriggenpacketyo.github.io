        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has issued an extended preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and 30 other cities and counties. These jurisdictions maintain "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts, which the Trump administration sought to penalize. The judge ruled that the executive orders aiming to withhold funds were an unconstitutional "coercive threat," expanding on a previous order protecting other cities. This legal development represents a notable setback for President Trump's campaign promise to remove millions of undocumented individuals and intensify pressure on sanctuary communities, reinforcing the ongoing legal battles over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, consequently falling into a first-place tie in the National League West. After a promising sweep against the Padres just a week prior, the Dodgers have squandered their recent momentum, splitting a series with the Colorado Rockies and now losing their latest matchup. Rookie Alex Freeland hit his first career home run, but the team's offense largely struggled against Padres pitchers Yu Darvish and Blake Snell, failing to capitalize on crucial late-game opportunities. This disappointing week leaves the team on the back foot, just days after appearing to solidify their standing in the division race.</p>

          <p>The United States is closely monitoring a fleet of five Chinese icebreakers and research vessels operating in the Arctic Ocean, raising significant concerns about China's intensifying strategic interest in the region. The vessels passed through the Bering Strait earlier this month, with the US Coast Guard noting their proximity to the Alaskan coast, near a disputed "extended continental shelf" area. China's increasing presence in the Arctic, marked by numerous scientific expeditions over the past five years, is viewed by the US as a potential challenge to its strategic interests and influence in the geopolitically sensitive polar region. This activity underscores growing geopolitical competition for resources and shipping routes in the rapidly changing Arctic environment.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez was denied parole by a California board, following his brother Erik's rejection a day earlier, ensuring both remain imprisoned for the 1989 murders of their parents. The board acknowledged Lyle's genuine remorse and his status as a model inmate, yet expressed significant concerns about the brutal nature of the crimes, his past deception, and lingering anti-social traits, including recent prison rule violations. The brothers have consistently claimed the killings were self-defense against years of alleged sexual assault and emotional abuse, a narrative disputed by prosecutors who emphasize premeditation and financial motives. This decision is a major setback for their bid for freedom, though Lyle may be considered for administrative review sooner than the next three-year hearing, while clemency requests are also being considered.</p>

His comprehensive plan, detailed in The Times, involves detaining arrivals, banning them from claiming asylum, and returning them to their countries of origin, even suggesting the UK withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. This radical approach comes amid rising poll numbers for Reform UK, fueled by public frustration over record small boat crossings and asylum applications. Both Labour and Conservatives have criticized the proposals, calling them unrealistic or recycled ideas, highlighting the contentious nature of immigration policy in current British politics.</p>

This effort by California Democrats seeks to replace maps drawn by an independent commission in 2021 with new boundaries that could boost Democratic representation, effectively counteracting similar moves by Texas Republicans and former President Trump. A significant contribution includes $10 million from GOP donor Charles Munger Jr. to oppose the measure, while a powerful labor group and other donors support it, highlighting the intense financial stakes. The ballot initiative underscores a broader national, mid-decade redistricting push, where states are strategically altering electoral maps to gain partisan advantage ahead of next year's midterm elections.</p>

Governor Glenn Youngkin, Attorney General Jason Miyares, and Democratic state Senator Ghazala Hashmi were among those who denounced the poster as unacceptable and a "horrific display of racism."

          <p>Malaysia has banned the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, aiming to keep these globally prized raw materials onshore for investment in downstream industries. This strategic move signals Malaysia's intent to prioritize its own development needs and could position it as a significant non-Chinese source for the United States, which is actively seeking alternatives to China's dominant supply. Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capacity provides a crucial head start in integrating into global supply chains, exercising its "geoeconomic agency." The policy encourages foreign investors to participate in Malaysia's rare earths sector, provided their projects involve local mineral processing, job creation, and technology transfers.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the leading venue for initial public offerings (IPOs) by mainland Chinese companies, surpassing the United States in the first eight months of 2025. Chinese firms raised a combined US$16.5 billion in Hong Kong compared to a mere US$740.9 million in the US during the same period, with new shares in Hong Kong jumping significantly more on their trading debuts. This notable shift is primarily attributed to the growing rivalry between China and the US, which introduces regulatory uncertainty and lingering delisting risks for Chinese stocks in American markets. The trend marks a major milestone for Hong Kong's capital market, successfully attracting funds back to Asia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has released over 300 pages of interview transcripts and audio recordings from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The interview, conducted while Maxwell serves a 20-year sentence, aimed to address ongoing concerns about the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell discussed her relationships with Epstein, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew, denying any inappropriate behavior by Trump or Clinton and calling a famous photo of Prince Andrew with an accuser "fake." She also expressed disbelief in Epstein's suicide but ruled out external murder, suggesting an internal prison situation.</p>

          <p>An explosion and fire at Smitty’s Supply, an automotive supply company in southeast Louisiana, sent massive flames and thick black smoke billowing into the air, forcing evacuations of nearby residents and an elementary school. Officials reported no injuries in the incident just north of Roseland, but a one-mile radius evacuation was ordered as a precautionary measure. The company deals in high-performance lubricants and automotive parts, raising concerns about potential chemical risks. Fire crews, along with the Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency, are on the scene to control the inferno and assess environmental impact, with the cause currently unknown.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at the Bethesda, Maryland home and Washington D.C. office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, confirming "court authorized activity" related to a classified documents investigation. President Trump claimed he learned of the raid from TV, subsequently calling Bolton a "lowlife" and questioning his patriotism. This action follows Bolton's 2020 memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," which portrayed Trump negatively and led to a Justice Department criminal inquiry into potential classified information disclosure, though no charges were ever filed. The search reignites scrutiny over the handling of classified materials, particularly given the political context and past animosity between Trump and Bolton.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Polling data in Britain suggests a growing political divide between young men and women, with young women increasingly identifying as left-wing and young men leaning more to the right. A 2025 survey found 20% of young British women aged 16-29 were left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with women favoring Labour and Greens, and men showing more support for Reform UK. Researchers attribute this trend to factors like higher education for women and differing views on gender equality, with some young men holding onto traditional masculinity and feeling disenfranchised. This development highlights the volatility of modern British politics and a perceived disconnect from traditional two-party loyalties.</p>

          <p>The release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts by the Justice Department has offered limited political respite for Donald Trump, as Maxwell's statements largely downplayed his association with Jeffrey Epstein. While Maxwell denied seeing Trump in inappropriate settings or having close ties to Epstein, the transcripts primarily focused on Epstein's personal life and offered little to quell the "Maga uproar" demanding more disclosures. The article frames the release within Trump's broader campaign against the "deep state" and highlights concerns about the politicization of the legal system, suggesting the transcripts ultimately failed to satisfy those seeking deeper conspiracies or more incriminating evidence against powerful figures.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington D.C. to be armed, escalating the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses an earlier stance where troops were unarmed, despite Trump's claims of bringing "total safety" to the city and considering expanding the mission to Chicago. The deployment, which now includes approximately 2,000 troops, is deeply unpopular with many D.C. residents. While the administration touts hundreds of arrests and seized firearms, local officials question the need for federal intervention and express concerns that arming troops could inflame tensions and undermine progress in reducing crime.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro pledging to pursue charges for every arrest. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers alone are not a reliable indicator of public safety or crime reduction, as they often only partially reflect actual crime. They note that "flooding the zone" with law enforcement can artificially inflate arrest figures, and many arrests may not lead to convictions. Experts also highlight the risk of increased police uses of force and potential rights violations when a large number of officers are deployed in a small area, raising questions about the true impact on community safety.</p>

          <p>A Colorado judge rejected a plea agreement for Jon Hallford, a funeral home owner who admitted to abusing 191 corpses, after emotional testimony from victims' families demanding a harsher sentence. Hallford and his wife, Carie, ran a fraudulent scheme at Return to Nature Funeral Home, taking money for cremations but stashing bodies and giving families concrete resembling ashes. The proposed 20-year sentence, running concurrently with a federal fraud sentence, was deemed insufficient by families who described profound pain and deception, some having mourned over urns containing false remains.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive crime crackdown in Washington D.C., including the clearing of homeless encampments, is drawing comparisons to San Francisco's controversial and intensified policies. Following a landmark Supreme Court ruling, San Francisco escalated its approach to homelessness, issuing numerous citations and arrests, which led to a significant reduction in visible encampments. While local businesses and some residents welcomed the change, advocates for the homeless criticize it as punitive, arguing it criminalizes poverty without solving underlying issues. This article explores the effectiveness and ethics of such "get-tough" strategies, noting that while tents decreased in San Francisco, the overall number of homeless individuals continued to rise, raising questions about long-term solutions.</p>

Similarly, Josh Kaufman, a musician who played on Taylor Swift's album, found "computer generated" tracks attributed to him.

This unexpected dovishness triggered a "panicked repositioning" in the market, leading to significant short liquidations for ETH and pushing its price higher. The rally also boosted shares of crypto-focused companies, with analysts suggesting Ether is emerging as a leader in the crypto market due to regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest around stablecoins, which account for a large portion of blockchain fees.
