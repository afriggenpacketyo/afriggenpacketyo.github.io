          <p>Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James reportedly sustained a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee during Game 5 of the Western Conference first-round series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, according to ESPN. The injury occurred after a collision with Minnesota guard Donte DiVincenzo. James, who averaged impressive stats this season, has a player option for next season, and the Lakers anticipate his return for at least one more NBA season. This article reports that if the Lakers had continued in the playoffs, the injury would have kept James off the court for three to five weeks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached a settlement in principle with the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, according to CBS News. Babbitt's estate had filed a $30 million civil suit alleging negligence by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd. The Justice Department, under the Biden administration, defended Byrd's actions, arguing Babbitt unlawfully entered the Capitol. The U.S. Capitol Police review found Byrd's actions saved lives.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to secure America's mineral supply chains by fast-tracking mining projects and considering controversial strategies like seizing deposits in Ukraine and Greenland, according to The Atlantic. However, these efforts are undermined by policies that cut demand for clean-tech manufacturing, the primary destination for these minerals. The article highlights how changes to federal policies, including cuts to the Loan Programs Office and potential repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act's electric-vehicle tax credits, are jeopardizing the domestic supply of minerals for the military and industries the administration supports.</p>
