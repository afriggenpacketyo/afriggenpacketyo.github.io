          <p>A China Coast Guard helicopter briefly entered Japanese airspace, triggering an immediate response from the Japan Coast Guard. This incident heightens tensions in the region and underscores ongoing concerns about maritime and aerial boundaries. The Japanese government is expected to lodge a formal protest and seek assurances that such violations will not recur, emphasizing the need for clear communication and adherence to international protocols to prevent future escalations. The event highlights the delicate balance of power and the potential for miscalculation in the East China Sea region.

          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The study, involving 800 participants across 37 countries, showed that 62.9% of those treated with semaglutide experienced less inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, compared to 34.3% in the placebo group. Semaglutide, traditionally used for type 2 diabetes, also led to improvements in liver fibrosis and weight loss. The researchers are planning a larger, longer-term study to further assess semaglutide's impact on liver complications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is launching legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The NAHT argues that the new school report cards, intended to replace one or two-word judgements, are simply "another crude grading system." This decision follows criticism from the sister of Ruth Perry, a head teacher who died by suicide after an Ofsted inspection, who called for a delay in implementing the new system. Ofsted maintains that the changes aim to support mental health and considers the union's claims untenable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has implemented a 25 percent tariff on essential auto parts, including engines, marking another blow to Japan's automotive industry. The administration is offering measures to help manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts used in the United States over the next two years. Japan, a key U.S. ally, faces significant economic impact as the auto industry is a major export sector. The tariffs aim to protect America's domestic automobile industry, but automakers argue that complex supply chains make it difficult to procure all necessary parts domestically in the short term.</p>

          <p>Analysts express skepticism about Ukraine's ability to supplant China as a key source of critical minerals for the U.S., despite a recent minerals deal with Washington. Most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in Russian-occupied territories, and extraction will take years due to a lack of processing capacity. China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earth elements, producing 270,000 tonnes last year, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete. The U.S. signed the minerals deal with Ukraine to diversify its supply chain amid trade disputes with China.</p>

The assessment, intended to inform MPs debating the issue, projects that initial numbers would be low but would grow over time. The analysis also considers financial implications, estimating potential NHS savings ranging from Â£5.84m to Â£59.6m after ten years, alongside costs for staffing and training. The Department of Health and Social Care remains neutral on the issue, aiming to ensure any legislation is workable and effective.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the U.S. economy has encountered early challenges, with the first quarter showing a contraction in GDP. Trump attributes any negative economic indicators to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while claiming credit for positive reports. The implementation of tariffs and trade policies has created uncertainty and confusion, impacting consumer spending and business investment. Economists suggest that the administration's erratic approach to trade is contributing to economic instability and raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

The antivenom has shown effectiveness against fatal doses from various venomous snakes in animal tests. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, inspired by his own near-fatal experiences. The current antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses, and harvesting their antibodies.</p>

These changes are intended to streamline bureaucracy, redirect resources towards economic growth, and address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign. The reforms are also seen as a way for the new party chief, To Lam, to strengthen his position ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress.</p>

President Trump says the tariff is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US. However, analysts say any immediate expansion in the US is likely to come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for businesses and customers. While companies have been shielded from the immediate pain due to a sales surge prompted by concerns about price hikes, General Motors warns of $5 billion in new costs.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods is cutting into advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet and other platforms. The expansion of the loophole for tariff-free shipments of goods nearly a decade ago gave rise to Temu, Shein and other low-cost online retailers offering items straight from Chinese factories at unfathomable discounts. Now, the advertising bonanza might be coming to an end after the demise of the shipping loophole that spurred it. The new tariffs are expected to deal a punishing blow to companies built on selling goods at rock-bottom prices and attracting customers through aggressive online advertising.</p>
