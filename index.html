          <p>A report from the 'Sea Change' podcast highlights the innovative ways communities in coastal Louisiana and Alaska are responding to severe land loss driven by climate change. These regions are on the front lines of coastal erosion, facing threats to their homes, infrastructure, and traditional ways of life. The article explores the different adaptation strategies being implemented, from large-scale engineering projects to community-led relocation efforts. It emphasizes the urgent need for proactive solutions as residents in these vulnerable areas work to build resilience against rising sea levels and environmental shifts.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a devastating increase in maternal and newborn mortality in Afghanistan following the Trump administration's decision to cut nearly all US aid. The report documents the closure of over 400 medical facilities, including a critical clinic in Badakhshan province, forcing women to give birth without medical assistance. The article shares harrowing firsthand accounts from families who have lost mothers and babies, directly linking these tragedies to the lack of accessible healthcare. The US government has justified the cuts over concerns of funds benefiting the Taliban, a claim the Taliban denies.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Spanish Vuelta cycling race was cut short after large-scale pro-Palestinian protests disrupted the route in Madrid, with authorities estimating over 100,000 participants. Protesters blocked parts of the course and clashed with police, forcing organizers to end the race early for safety reasons and cancel the podium ceremony. Jonas Vingegaard was confirmed as the overall winner of the three-week Grand Tour event. The race had been a focal point for protests against the participation of the Israeli-owned team Premier Tech, leading to multiple interruptions and alterations throughout the competition.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man was arrested in Phoenix after being filmed trampling a memorial for the recently assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The incident occurred outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded. Video footage shows the suspect, identified as Ryder Corral, kicking over flowers and flags before being tackled by a mourner and subsequently detained by police. Authorities noted that the suspect was wearing a shirt with a design similar to the one worn by Kirk's alleged assassin, though a direct connection has not been established. He faces charges of criminal damage and disorderly conduct.</p>

          <h2>Financial Institutions Express Concern Over Growing Popularity of 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 16:31:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is surging, with an estimated 86.5 million American users in 2024. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into short-term, interest-free installments, present a direct challenge to the revenue models of traditional credit card companies. Beyond the competition, banks are wary because BNPL usage creates a significant blind spot in consumer credit profiles, making it difficult to assess a borrower's overall debt and risk. This lack of visibility into short-term loans could pose broader challenges for the financial industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville won the men's 100m final at the World Athletics Championship, becoming the first Jamaican man to claim a global 100m title since Usain Bolt in 2016. The victory, celebrated by Bolt in the stands, is being hailed as the start of a new era for Jamaican sprinting. Seville's win, achieved with a personal best time of 9.77 seconds, led a Jamaican one-two finish with Kishane Thompson taking silver. After previous disappointments in major finals, Seville's performance demonstrated his mental fortitude and fulfilled the long-held expectations that he could be Bolt's successor on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his NFL earnings into a diverse portfolio of technology startups and venture capital funds.

This strategy reflects a growing trend among professional athletes to secure long-term financial stability and build generational wealth beyond their relatively short playing careers.</p>

          <p>UCLA has dismissed head football coach DeShaun Foster following a winless 0-3 start to the season, which included consecutive losses to Mountain West Conference teams.

The decision signals a shift in expectations for the program, which has struggled for national relevance. Special assistant Tim Skipper will serve as the interim coach for the remainder of the season while the university begins a national search for a permanent replacement.</p>

In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother stated that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences, despite being stripped of royal duties. He argued that Prince Andrew should be held to the fullest extent of the law. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 that included no admission of liability.</p>

The results are seen as a critical test for the national governing coalition and reflect a continuing rightward shift in parts of the German electorate.
