          <h2>Canada Faces Unprecedented Measles Outbreak, Surpassing U.S. Case Numbers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:50:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, significantly more than the U.S. despite a smaller population. The surge is primarily affecting unvaccinated children, with epicenters in Ontario and Alberta, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities where vaccine hesitancy has been amplified by post-pandemic misinformation. Health officials attribute the spread to low vaccination rates and note that reported numbers are likely just the "tip of the iceberg," highlighting the challenge of rebuilding trust in public health systems. The situation underscores the global resurgence of measles and the critical need for increased immunization.</p>

          <p>Scott Turner, the current HUD Secretary and a former player for the Washington Redskins, has publicly supported President Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to change their name back. Turner, who played for the team in the 1990s, stated his alignment with the president on social media. This follows Trump's posts on Truth Social urging both the Commanders and MLB's Cleveland Guardians to revert to their former names, even threatening to block a new stadium deal for the Commanders if they refuse. Despite this pressure, the team's current owner, Josh Harris, has indicated that the franchise is moving forward with the Commanders name and is not considering a change.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:14:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom that looming tariffs will harm the stock market, this analysis argues that multiple positive factors are providing strong support. These tailwinds include excellent corporate earnings, the economic stimulus from President Trump's "big beautiful bill" which benefits consumers, and significant tax relief for businesses that encourages spending and investment. Additionally, massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a robust IPO market are creating jobs and wealth. The article suggests these fundamental strengths will likely outweigh the drama surrounding trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government Revives Pensions Commission to Address Future Retirement Shortfalls</h2>

          <p>The UK government has warned that individuals retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly increased. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to investigate why nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The analysis reveals stark disparities, including a 48% gender gap in private pension wealth and low participation among certain ethnic groups. The commission aims to build a national consensus on a new strategy to boost private savings, though it will not address the rising costs of the state pension.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old Canadian girl, Melina Galanis Frattolin, was found dead in Ticonderoga, New York, after her father had initially reported her kidnapped from a rest stop near Lake George.

The New York State Police have taken over the investigation, stating there is no evidence of an abduction and no ongoing threat to the public. The father, 45-year-old Luciano Frattolin, is being questioned by investigators as the focus shifts from a kidnapping to a homicide investigation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. This shift coincides with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals, and approval is now primarily concentrated within the Republican and MAGA base. Meanwhile, a strong majority of Americans, concerned about rising prices, believe the administration should focus more on the economy. The president's recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is also viewed unfavorably, with most believing it primarily benefits the wealthy rather than the middle or working class.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign after his ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house of parliament in a recent election. The defeat for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner, Komeito, reflects public frustration over rising prices and the looming threat of U.S. trade tariffs. This loss further weakens the coalition's political influence, as it had already lost its majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Analysts note that the result could lead to political instability and a potential leadership challenge within the LDP at a critical time for U.S.-Japan trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now tens of billions over budget and years behind schedule, was destined for problems due to fundamental challenges in British infrastructure development, according to insiders. The project's initial ambition to build the world's fastest, most frequent line drove up costs and complexity, while the UK's dense population and property-owning democracy made land acquisition and route planning exceptionally difficult. A complex parliamentary approval process allowed for thousands of costly changes to appease local constituencies, and the cumbersome planning system created further delays. These factors suggest that without major reforms, any large-scale UK infrastructure project faces similar risks.</p>

These children were born to unwed mothers who, facing immense social stigma, temporarily placed them in Catholic-run institutions, never consenting to their permanent adoption or relocation overseas. The investigation, based on church archives, found that mothers were often misled, tricked into signing forms, or even told their children had died. This systematic practice left a devastating legacy, with thousands of American adoptees and their Italian birth mothers spending decades searching for one another.</p>

While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his peers and analysts point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like."

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to close the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific research arm. The ORD is responsible for analyzing environmental hazards, from toxic chemicals to climate change, and provides the scientific basis for regulations. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the closure is part of a broader effort to streamline operations and will save nearly $750 million, while adding scientific experts to other program offices. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, condemned the move as a "travesty" that will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin issued a lighthearted warning to his audience in Wisconsin before the band's "Jumbotron Song," advising them to do their makeup because the cameras would soon be on them. This comes after a recent concert where the jumbotron captured a man and woman, later identified as the CEO and HR head of tech company Astronomer, cuddling in the crowd, who then quickly separated. The viral moment led to an internal investigation and the CEO's resignation. Martin's pre-song banter appeared to be a subtle acknowledgment of the incident that has since spawned numerous internet memes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert and researcher argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness with phrases like "you're okay," can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. Cultivating self-connection builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and supports authentic confidence and mental health. The author provides practical tips, such as validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and looking for the needs behind a child's behavior, to help parents strengthen this essential life skill.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, states that an extension of the 90-day pause on new tariffs between the U.S. and China is almost inevitable, as neither side wants a return to triple-digit tariffs. He notes that while China has taken steps on restricting fentanyl precursors, the U.S. has not yet reciprocated by lowering related tariffs, which could pave a path toward a more normal trade relationship. Stein expresses concern from the business community that discussions between the two nations have been focused almost exclusively on tariffs, neglecting other critical issues. This creates a precarious environment where American businesses must navigate significant uncertainty to remain in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable and homeless housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. With a $300 million investment fund, the initiative is bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to provide its own equity and use conventional loans to build faster and at a fraction of the cost of typical government-funded projects. While its proposed rents are higher than those in subsidized housing, the model aims to attract private capital to the affordable housing sector. The goal is to create a new, scalable solution to the housing crisis by making it a viable market for for-profit developers.</p>

This initiative is part of a larger overhaul of the water industry, which faces intense public scrutiny over rising bills and record-high sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has vowed to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes, bringing the water sector's consumer protection in line with other utilities like energy and telecommunications.</p>

She criticized the tactics of federal agents, who she said operated in unmarked cars while masked, leading to confusion and terror. While acknowledging the administration's help during recent wildfires, Bass described the immigration approach as punitive and called for an end to the "reign of terror."</p>
