          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, apologized after saying he has never had to buy rice because he receives so much from supporters, stirring criticism amidst rising rice prices. Eto's comments came as his ministry explores ways to lower surging rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The incident highlights the sensitivity of rice prices for Japanese voters, potentially impacting Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party ahead of upper house elections in July, especially considering recent polls show low approval for the government's handling of the rice price issue.</p>

          <p>Cognac producers in France face challenges from climate change, US and Chinese tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Winemakers are dealing with sweeter grapes due to climate change, requiring adjustments to maintain the desired acidity for cognac.

This show of force occurred as Mr. Trump claimed he would speak with Mr. Putin and President Zelensky about a potential cease-fire, although Mr. Putin has added preconditions to any potential truce. The Ukrainian military warned that Russia's goal is to attack with swarms of more than 500 long-range strike drones regularly, intended to exhaust Ukraine‚Äôs air defenses.</p>

          <p>A downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Moody's, coupled with concerns about government debt, is causing unease in financial markets. The credit rating downgrade has amplified worries about the cost of President Trump's policies, particularly the plan to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, which could add trillions to the national debt. The downgrade could shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, potentially leading to higher premiums for US debt and broader market volatility.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis was made after Biden experienced urinary symptoms, and his medical team is reviewing treatment options. Despite the seriousness of the diagnosis, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which could allow for effective management. Support has poured in from both sides of the political spectrum, with President Trump and other prominent figures wishing Biden a speedy recovery.</p>

          <h2>Climate Change and Goats Threaten Unique Trees</h2>

          <p>Dragon's blood trees, unique to Socotra, Yemen, are threatened by climate change and goats. Increasingly intense cyclones uproot trees, and invasive goats endanger young trees. The trees are a pillar of Socotra‚Äôs ecosystem. Free-roaming goats devour saplings before they have a chance to grow. Conservation efforts are complicated by Yemen‚Äôs civil war. With little national support, conservation efforts are left largely up to Socotrans, but local resources are scarce.</p>

The game ended in a 2-2 tie at home before 23,083 fans, but still without a win in 14 games, prolonging the winning drought and extending a streak that has made it the worst defending champion at the start of a championship in the history of the league.</p>
