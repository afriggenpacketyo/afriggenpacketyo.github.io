          <p>President Trump stated he was "not happy" with both Israel and Iran after reported exchanges marred a newly announced ceasefire. He criticized Israel for immediately dropping "a boat load of bombs" after the deal was made, and also expressed displeasure with Iran. Trump referenced allegations that Iran fired missiles toward Israel after the ceasefire took effect, which Iran denied. Despite his frustration, Trump maintained his belief that Iran is still committed to peace, highlighting the complexities of the ongoing conflict.</p>

The budget plans include substantial new debt to address aging infrastructure, support economic stimulus, and fund record levels of military investment. The defense budget is set to more than double by 2029, reaching 3.5% of GDP, driven by growing security concerns and pressure from the U.S. for increased military spending.

The report cites examples, such as the arrest of a Wisconsin judge for obstructing immigration authorities, and concerns about masked agents and weaponized DHS propaganda.

          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only play a limited role in the future financial system due to lacking key characteristics of traditional currencies. The BIS suggests that stablecoins rely on pseudonymity, making them susceptible to illicit use. Instead, the BIS proposes a unified platform for tokenized central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds to form the basis of the next-generation monetary and financial system. This warning comes as major economies consider adopting stablecoins to further globalize their currencies.</p>

The lack of support from the tech industry, traditionally a strong ally of the LGBTQ+ community, highlights a broader trend of companies distancing themselves from public support of LGBTQ+ causes.

Although initial price surges moderated, experts suggest that ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market.

While analysts believe a full closure is unlikely, any disruption could impact markets in China, India, Japan, and South Korea, potentially leading to higher gas prices for American consumers.

          <p>The UK has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas, such as resilience and security. The announcement has faced criticism for lacking immediate funding, with concerns raised about addressing current geopolitical threats.

          <p>Google may face changes to its online search services in the UK following concerns raised by regulators about the company's dominant market position. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is consulting on a proposal to designate Google with "strategic market status" under new competition rules. This designation grants the CMA expanded powers to enforce consumer protections and take action against tech giants, including imposing fines for breaches. The move is similar to the EU's Digital Markets Act and reflects a global trend of increased scrutiny over the power of large tech companies.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea that the decline of deep reading and the rise of digital media are altering how people think and engage with politics. It draws on the work of Walter Ong to suggest that society is reverting to an oral culture, which emphasizes memorability and communal affirmation over abstract thought and rational analysis. The author questions whether the decline of deep literacy is driving illiberal politics in America, noting that historical analogies may obscure more than they reveal. The article concludes that while there is reason to worry about the mental habits instilled by digital media, it is important to avoid overstating the social harms of cultural marginalization.</p>

          <p>Wall Street hedge funds are offering to purchase insurance claims related to the Eaton fire in Altadena, a move that has alarmed California state officials. These funds aim to profit by buying subrogation claims from insurers, which would allow them to seek reimbursement from Southern California Edison if the utility is found liable for causing the fire. State officials worry that this could deplete the state's wildfire fund, which would be used to cover most of the damage claims. The practice raises ethical questions about profiting from a disaster that caused significant loss of life and property.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles for immigration protests were also sent to participate in a raid on illegal marijuana farms in Riverside County. This has intensified the legal battle between California's governor and the Trump administration over the use of National Guard troops. The administration argues that the deployment is necessary for protecting federal agents enforcing immigration law, while California officials question the use of troops in missions unrelated to protecting federal personnel. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions between state and federal authorities over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Veterans' Advocates Express Concern Over Low Morale Amid L.A. Deployment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Veterans' advocates are raising concerns about low morale among National Guard members and Marines deployed to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. Many troops view the assignment as overtly political and are troubled by the prospect of being pitted against fellow Americans. Concerns are also growing about the potential impact on military retention and recruitment, as the deployment is seen as misaligned with the reasons many joined the military. The situation has prompted calls for better support and understanding for the troops involved.</p>
