        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Japanese court has rejected an order for former executives of TEPCO to pay damages related to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. The ruling overturns a previous decision that held the executives liable for negligence in preventing the catastrophe, which followed a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The case has been closely followed as it addresses corporate responsibility in the face of natural disasters and the subsequent handling of the nuclear crisis. This decision marks a significant legal development regarding accountability for the Fukushima incident.</p>

          <p>A mural honoring baseball icon Jackie Robinson and Minnie MiÃ±oso in Miami's Dorsey Park was defaced with Nazi symbols, prompting a police investigation. The vandalism, discovered by a young boy, has sparked outrage in the community, with leaders condemning it as a hate crime. The murals, displayed since 2011, celebrate Robinson's breaking of the color barrier in Major League Baseball and MiÃ±oso's pioneering role as MLB's first Afro-Latino player. The incident has led to calls for unity and a renewed commitment to justice and the preservation of history, with plywood now covering the defaced artwork.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk have engaged in a public dispute, with Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts and Musk alleging Trump's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. The feud originated from Musk's criticism of the Republican's "One Big Beautiful Bill," which includes tax cuts and spending cuts. Trump responded by claiming Musk was upset about the elimination of electric vehicle subsidies, while Musk accused Trump of ingratitude and suggested he would have lost the election without his support. The public spat highlights the growing divide between the two figures and the potential implications for Musk's businesses.</p>

          <p>USA Rare Earth, an Oklahoma-based company, is working to increase U.S. production of critical rare earth magnets, essential for technologies like semiconductors and electric cars. Currently, China dominates the rare earth magnet market, producing about 95% of the world's supply, creating a potential choke point for U.S. defense and technology industries. The company is assembling machines to produce up to 5,000 tons of magnets annually, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China. This initiative aligns with efforts to secure domestic supply chains for crucial materials.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended foreign student visas for Harvard University, citing national security concerns and alleging the university has failed to address foreign ties and civil rights issues. Harvard responded by filing court documents to block the order, arguing it is retaliatory and violates the university's First Amendment rights. The order impacts nearly 7,000 foreign students, comprising 27% of Harvard's population, and follows previous attempts by the administration to freeze federal funding and revoke Harvard's certification to enroll foreign students. The university contends the move is a vendetta against Harvard for exercising its free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Japanese startup ispace Inc. has failed in its second attempt to achieve a successful lunar landing, with its lander Resilience likely impacting the Moon's surface due to insufficient deceleration.

Despite the setback, the company remains committed to future lunar missions and hopes to catch up with U.S. companies that have already accomplished successful lunar landings.

          <p>This article explores the growing trend of food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods and consumer demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. Retailers and food brands are responding by offering items with fewer additives, although nutritionists caution that this can sometimes lead to the omission of essential fortified nutrients. Experts suggest that simplifying formulas and using novel processing technologies can help create less processed products while maintaining food safety and shelf life. The article also discusses the marketing strategies and higher price points associated with low-ingredient food products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that in many states, young offenders are denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention while awaiting trial, unlike the adult system. This means that the time kids spend in detention often doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face, extending their confinement and negatively impacting their rehabilitation. Experts argue that this disparity stems from the juvenile system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to unequal application of fundamental rights. The lack of credit for time served can result in longer periods of incarceration and increased costs to taxpayers.</p>

          <p>This article reviews three new film releases: 'Ballerina,' a John Wick spin-off starring Ana de Armas; 'Dangerous Animals,' a thriller about a psychopathic tour guide; and 'The Ritual,' a horror film featuring Al Pacino. 'Ballerina' is praised for its action sequences and Armas' performance, though it lacks a compelling story. 'Dangerous Animals' is noted for its suspense and strong performances, particularly by Jai Courtney. 'The Ritual,' despite Pacino's presence, is criticized for its lack of focus and overreliance on jump scares, making it appealing only to those fascinated by the exorcism theme.</p>

          <p>Newly unearthed documents reveal Winston Churchill's urgent efforts to secure penicillin supplies before D-Day to treat expected casualties. The notes highlight Churchill's frustration with Britain's slow progress in producing the "wonder drug," despite its British discovery. He expressed disappointment that the US was far ahead in production and pushed for increased supplies from Great Britain. While sufficient penicillin was eventually obtained, mainly from the US, it was initially only available for military use, underscoring the critical need for the antibiotic during the war.</p>

          <p>Chinese students in the United States are facing increased uncertainty about their academic futures due to recent visa restrictions and enhanced scrutiny. The Trump administration's announcement to "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields" has caused concern. Students at Harvard University are particularly affected by the administration's ban on new foreign students. The situation has prompted universities to reassure Chinese students, but many fear discrimination and the potential loss of academic opportunities.</p>

          <p>BeyoncÃ© launched her London residency of the 'Cowboy Carter' tour at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, delivering a nearly three-hour spectacle featuring songs from her new country album and past hits. Despite the show's flawless execution and themes honoring black performers in country music, slow ticket sales and high prices have been a major topic. Promoters slashed ticket prices before the shows, disappointing some early buyers. The performance blended country clichÃ©s with BeyoncÃ©'s signature style, featuring numerous costume changes and appearances by her daughter, Blue Ivy, but some felt the stadium setting wasn't ideal for the country theme.</p>
