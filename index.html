          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for the recent missile and drone attacks on Kyiv, calling them "not necessary, and very bad timing." This rebuke comes after Trump suggested that Russia was "ready" for a peace deal with Ukraine. Trump urged Putin to "STOP!" and emphasized the high casualty rate of "5000 soldiers a week" to push for a swift resolution to the conflict. Trump's message follows one of the most damaging attacks on Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old, Joseph Kling, has been arrested and charged with aggravated arson and arson for allegedly starting the Jones Road Wildfire in New Jersey. The fire, which began in the Greenwood Wildlife Management area near Waretown, has consumed over 13,000 acres and is 50% contained. Investigators determined that Kling allegedly set wooden pallets on fire and left the area before the fire was fully extinguished. The wildfire smoke is expected to reach New York City, prompting air quality alerts due to elevated pollution levels, although the intensity is not expected to be as severe as the Canadian wildfires of 2023.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has withdrawn its 2025 financial guidance, citing an uncertain economic outlook and weaker-than-expected leisure travel bookings. CEO Robert Isom noted a significant drop in domestic leisure travel starting in February. The airline reported a first-quarter loss of $473 million, wider than the previous year, despite a slight increase in unit revenue driven by international bookings and premium cabins. The company's efforts to rebuild its corporate travel business were also impacted by economic uncertainty and the tragic accident involving American Eagle Flight 5342.</p>

          <p>The German government has revised its economic growth forecast to zero for the third consecutive year, attributing the stagnation to the impact of President Trump's tariffs. Economy Minister Robert Habeck stated that Germany's export-oriented economy is particularly vulnerable to the 25% tariffs on imported automobiles, steel, and aluminum. The tariffs are expected to exacerbate existing challenges, including weak foreign demand and reduced competitiveness. Germany is the only G7 nation whose economy has not grown in the past two years.</p>

          <p>Merck has lowered its full-year profit guidance, citing an estimated $200 million in tariff costs and a charge related to a recent license agreement with Hengrui Pharma. The expected tariff charge primarily reflects levies between the U.S. and China. The new outlook does not account for President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. However, the guidance does include a one-time charge of roughly 6 cents per share related to the Hengrui Pharma agreement. Merck reiterated its full-year sales forecast of between $64.1 billion and $65.6 billion.</p>

          <p>Energy secretary Ed Miliband is considering plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy. He did not set out details of the "zonal pricing" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment. But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering investing in companies that mine and process critical minerals in an effort to end U.S. dependence on imports from countries including China, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said this week. The U.S. may need to make an "equity investment in each of these companies that's taking on China in critical minerals," he said. The Trump administration is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund to guard companies that invest in approved projects against changing political winds in Washington.</p>

          <p>China on Thursday denied U.S. President Donald Trump's assertion that the two sides were involved in active negotiations over tariffs, and said the U.S. should revoke its unilateral tariffs against the nation. China's pushback on tariffs comes after Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the final tariff rate on China's goods would come down "substantially." China also made it clear that talks should involve the cancellation of all tariffs it currently faces.</p>
