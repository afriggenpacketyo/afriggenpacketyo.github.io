          <p>The Polish presidential election, seen as a referendum on populist nationalism in Europe, concluded with exit polls indicating a neck-and-neck race between the two leading candidates. The vote is too close to call, with both contenders claiming potential victory. The final outcome of the election will significantly impact Poland's political landscape and its relationship with the European Union, potentially influencing the balance of power within the region. The official results are eagerly awaited to determine the country's leadership and direction. The political climate in Poland will be influenced by the outcome of the election, whether the winner is a supporter of the EU or not.

          <p>An attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, has left six people injured, with authorities investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack, which involved a makeshift flamethrower and an incendiary device directed at a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, were hospitalized with burns, and the FBI is treating the incident as ideologically motivated violence. The attack has heightened concerns about violence targeting the Jewish community, occurring on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, with all upcoming Run for Their Lives events canceled. The incident is being investigated as a targeted act of violence.</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of over 50 people and left scores wounded, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses reported being fired upon from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while Israel's military denies involvement, stating its forces did not target civilians. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claims it delivered aid without incident, dismissing reports of deaths and chaos, but U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to work with the new system due to concerns about Israeli control over aid distribution. This incident occurred amidst faltering ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress. The violence has heightened tensions and further complicated efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians.</p>

          <p>MarÃ­a Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, expresses concerns about a potential increase in internal repression by NicolÃ¡s Maduro's regime following the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in the country. Machado, who is living in the shadows, highlights the arrest of over 70 activists and opposition leaders prior to recent elections, accusing the regime of fabricated charges. She views the partial revocation of Chevron's license as a positive step, given Venezuela's economic reliance on oil exports, and believes it will help when democracy returns. Machado describes Maduro's regime as a sinking ship, facing international isolation and an unsustainable economic crisis, with projections indicating further economic contraction and dire living conditions.

          <p>Universities in England are facing financial strain due to a drop in international students and rising costs, leading to course cutbacks and closures. A government review is underway to address long-term funding for higher education, while the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration among universities to navigate these challenges. A Universities UK report suggests greater collaboration could prevent subject "cold spots," where students lack local access to desired courses. The CMA acknowledges the financial problems and aims to support collaboration, such as sharing back-office functions and discussing mergers, to promote efficiency and maintain educational opportunities for students. The review will be published before the summer.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures preventing children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs. The charity's report calls for a notification system to alert authorities when a child moves into temporary housing, as over 164,000 homeless children are currently living in such accommodations across England. Families are being displaced due to a lack of affordable housing, with some Londoners moved far away, impacting children's education and mental health. The government says it is investing Â£1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation, driving up housing standards and delivering on our commitment to build more social and affordable homes.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing scrutiny over a new land law that allows the state to expropriate privately owned land without compensation in limited circumstances, sparking criticism from US President Donald Trump and local political groups. The government defends the law as necessary to address historical inequalities in land ownership, with most private farmland still owned by white people. The law primarily targets land needed for public interest, such as land reform, and compensation is expected in most cases, with owners receiving "just-and-equitable" compensation rather than market value. The government hopes the law will facilitate land redistribution to black people dispossessed during white-minority rule, though its implementation faces political challenges and legal challenges.</p>

She has sought assistance from her Republican senator to formally refuse the pardon and believes it damages Americans' views of the federal government. Hemphill's actions stand in contrast to other Jan. 6 defendants who have embraced their pardons and utilized them in court arguments. Hemphill expects her protest to garner attention from the president.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is still fighting to correct what he believes is an unjust military pension, which he says was "robbed" from him after his discharge in 1970. Williams discovered that his brother-in-law, with a similar service record, received a significantly better pension due to a later discharge date in 1972, when pension rules had changed. Despite numerous appeals to official bodies and support from MPs, Williams has been told his pension reflects his full and correct entitlement. Williams and his wife hope to bring attention to his case and encourage other affected veterans to come forward, maintaining that he was never informed about the impact of different discharge dates. He intends to contact the current Stroud MP.</p>

The analyst suggests that the power of the White House creates uncertainty, affecting various sectors, including technology, retail, pharmaceuticals, and energy. The analyst claims that the administration's actions, such as attacks on specific companies and inconsistent trade policies, create a "Trump discount" that holds back market performance.

The shortage is impacting patients with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis, with some reportedly skipping meals to ration their medication. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) reports that members feel current arrangements for managing the shortages are inadequate. The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledges "European-wide supply issues" due to manufacturing constraints and says it is working to mitigate the impact on patients.

          <p>Scientists predict that Earth's atmosphere will eventually revert to a state rich in methane and low in oxygen, potentially within the next billion years, posing a threat to complex life. The shift, predicted to occur rapidly, will take the planet back to conditions similar to those before the Great Oxidation Event. Researchers emphasize that atmospheric oxygen may not be a permanent feature of habitable worlds, impacting the search for extraterrestrial life. The model projects a sharp decline in atmospheric oxygen, leading to the end of human beings and most other life forms that rely on oxygen. The study highlights the importance of searching for biosignatures besides oxygen in the quest for life beyond Earth.</p>
