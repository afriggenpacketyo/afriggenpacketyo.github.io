            <p>With Birmingham's refuse workers engaging in a month-long strike over pay disputes, the city is grappling with mounting piles of uncollected rubbish, prompting the city council to declare a major incident. The local government has sought assistance from neighboring authorities, and the national government has now enlisted the Army's help to provide logistical support. While soldiers will not be deployed to collect rubbish, their office-based planners will aid in managing the crisis, as Unite union members continue their strike that began on March 11.</p>

            <p>Dr. Peter Marks, former top vaccines official at the FDA, has criticized HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for downplaying the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles amid a record outbreak. Marks argued that even a single death from measles is inexcusable. He also expressed concern about the administration's approach to vaccines and the ouster of experienced officials. Marks warned that it is now challenging for some of his former colleagues in the federal government to endorse vaccines due to the current environment.</p>
