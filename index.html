          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 22:01:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur with close ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, to head NASA. This decision, announced just before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote, was attributed to a review of Isaacman's prior associations, although no specific reason was provided by the White House. Trump stated he would soon announce a new nominee aligned with his "America First" agenda for space exploration, emphasizing the goal of planting the American flag on Mars. Musk responded to the withdrawal by praising Isaacman as competent and good-hearted, as Isaacman had previously expressed his commitment to advancing humanity's spacefaring capabilities with Trump's support. The change in nomination has introduced uncertainty into NASA's future leadership and direction. Optimism in this situation is slightly tempered by the political nature of the appointment. </p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is advocating for Asian countries to increase their military spending to counter China's growing influence and military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth emphasized the need for regional deterrence against China, asserting that Beijing is actively preparing to use military force. He drew a parallel to the Trump administration's push for increased defense spending among European countries, calling for Asian nations to take on a greater burden in responding to regional conflicts. Hegseth's statements come amid rising tensions in the region and highlight the U.S. commitment to maintaining a strong presence in the Indo-Pacific. The increased spending may lead to a more stable and secure region. </p>

          <p>The late actor George Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently created a lasting connection to former House Speaker John Boehner during Boehner's first congressional race in 1990. Wendt, campaigning for his brother-in-law Greg Jolivette, who ran against Boehner, mistakenly conflated Boehner with another politician involved in a scandal during an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show." Boehner's team responded, leading to a brief but contentious exchange between the campaigns, as Wendt later apologized for the error. Despite the gaffe, Boehner won the election and eventually became Speaker of the House, as the incident is now remembered as a humorous footnote in his political career. </p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees but later corrected the figure based on information from a beekeeper assisting at the scene. The incident prompted a temporary road closure and warnings for the public to avoid the area, particularly those with bee sting allergies, as beekeepers worked to recover the hives and ensure the bees' return. Most of the bees were expected to return to their hives by morning, and the hive boxes were recovered and restored. The bees are expected to return to their hives, and the disruption is resolved. </p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space from its West Texas launch site. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and panoramic views before returning to Earth. The New Shepard rocket performed a controlled landing, while the crew capsule parachuted to the desert floor, as this marks Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight since July 2021, bringing the total number of passengers launched to 68. While the exact cost per seat is not disclosed, it is estimated to be upwards of $500,000, with the company having the sub-orbital passenger market to itself until Virgin Galactic resumes flights. The success of the flight signifies continued progress in space tourism. </p>

The group aims for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces, and unimpeded humanitarian aid, as a senior Hamas official noted specific concerns regarding U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli troop withdrawal. While Hamas asserts it did not reject the proposal, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East deemed the response "totally unacceptable," as the United Nations reports severe food shortages in Gaza, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Despite ongoing negotiations, violence continues, with reports of casualties from Israeli strikes. </p>

          <p>The Hollywood film and television industry in California is facing increasing challenges, with concerns growing over its long-term viability in the state. Following monthslong strikes in 2023, the industry has seen a significant decline in production and job opportunities, as television production in the Los Angeles area has decreased by 58% since 2021. California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to more than double the state's film and TV tax credits to $750 million in an effort to retain productions. However, some industry experts question whether this measure is sufficient to offset the high costs of working in California compared to other locations offering more generous tax incentives, as many in Hollywood are struggling to find work. </p>

The proposed rebuild would include a visitor's center, museum, cafe, and gardens, preserving the chapel's ocean views, as the chapel is currently working to secure the site and raise the estimated $20 million needed for the project.

          <p>The US has sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House after a UN report indicated Iran has increased its enriched uranium production. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged receiving "elements of a US deal" from Oman, as the proposal follows an IAEA report noting Iran's possession of over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated it is in Tehran's "best interest to accept" the deal, as the proposal aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.

          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) is preparing for a leadership election in September, but faces an immediate threat from a mass-recall campaign by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The recall campaign could jeopardize the KMT's legislative majority and destabilize the party, as KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has signaled his intention to step down after completing his term. Analysts suggest that the KMT must address the recall challenge to ensure a smooth leadership transition. The KMT is hoping a new party chair can steer it back to power after years on the political sidelines. </p>

This flexibility reassures swing voters that extreme actions are provisional and subject to change. By checking himself and being checked by others, Trump meets the expectations of a crucial group of voters who appreciate his pressure on institutions they distrust, as this dynamic interaction is key to his continued viability. Despite facing setbacks, Trump's ability to recalibrate has allowed him to maintain a normal level of support in a polarized country. </p>
