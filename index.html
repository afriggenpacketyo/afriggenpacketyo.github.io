          <p>Ahead of a planned U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, key European allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, have issued a joint statement insisting that Ukraine must be included in any peace negotiations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly stated that any agreements made without Kyiv's participation would be considered "dead decisions" and would not be respected. The European leaders emphasized that Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are paramount, expressing concerns that a bilateral deal between the U.S. and Russia could undermine European security and force unacceptable territorial concessions from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that the field of robotics could experience its "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in an entirely new environment without prior specific training. While acknowledging that current hardware is sufficient, Wang stated that the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the main bottleneck. He expressed skepticism about current models but noted that text-to-video generation for robot motion control shows higher potential for success.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all water usage, including flushing toilets, due to a severe service outage affecting about 9,200 households. The crisis began when a critical water control valve broke, coinciding with a major heatwave. Although some service has been restored, officials warn that continued consumption is preventing a 10-million-gallon tank from repressurizing, which delays full repairs and the lifting of a boil-water advisory. The situation was complicated further when a temporary bypass pipe burst, likely causing additional delays in restoring normal service.</p>

          <p>Northern China is once again grappling with severe flooding during its traditional rainy season, marking the fifth major flood disaster in the region since 2012. This year's event is considered unusual because the late-July storms primarily impacted the northern districts of Beijing. This contrasts with previous major floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the southern parts of the capital. The recurring and shifting nature of these extreme weather events raises ongoing questions about the city's preparedness and the broader impacts of climate change on the region's weather patterns.</p>

Furthermore, major reconstruction of the Camp Nou stadium is behind schedule, forcing the team's home opener to be played at a small training ground.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is facing a renewed and escalating threat of nuclear conflict, yet public opposition is strangely silent compared to the anti-nuclear movements of the Cold War. The author points to Russia's formal withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and the corresponding military buildup by NATO as evidence of a collapsing global arms control framework. The piece warns that nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as viable for offensive use, not just deterrence, and criticizes the puerile threats exchanged by world leaders. It calls for a revival of public activism to halt the slide toward potential global catastrophe.</p>

The documentary portrays the Qing general's campaign against an invading Central Asian general who sought to create a separatist Islamic state.

          <p>After a period dominated by "quiet luxury," the high-end fashion industry is reportedly shifting back towards more visible, logo-heavy "loud luxury" to stimulate consumer interest. Analysts suggest this change is driven by a need for novelty as brands like Gucci and Burberry struggle with softer sales. The move away from understated styles is an attempt to reignite brand desire among consumers who have become weary of significant price hikes without corresponding product innovation. This trend could further divide the market between ultra-luxe brands and more accessible, yet statement-making, labels. (not investment advice)</p>
