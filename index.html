          <h2>Musk Scales Back Government Role Amid Tesla's Profit Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 05:16:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk will significantly reduce his involvement in the US government's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) due to a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and sales. This decision follows accusations that Musk's focus has shifted away from Tesla, leading to protests and boycotts. Despite stepping back from Doge, Musk intends to remain involved in the Trump administration to some capacity, citing the work as "critical." Tesla's financial struggles, including a 20% decrease in car sales and a 70% profit decline, are attributed to changing political sentiment and Trump's tariffs on China. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP shares experienced a significant jump after activist investor Elliott disclosed a stake exceeding 5% in the company. This move signals potential pressure on BP to shift its strategic focus back towards oil and gas, diverging from its previous green energy initiatives. BP had previously announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027 after scaling back its emissions targets. The activist investor's involvement has led to speculation that BP may further prioritize its core oil and gas businesses to restore investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government faces increasing financial strain due to higher-than-expected borrowing and the looming impact of US tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pursuing a trade deal with the US to mitigate the effects of these tariffs on UK exports. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth forecast for the UK, citing tariffs, rising inflation, and borrowing costs. Reeves's commitment to fiscal rules may necessitate spending cuts or tax increases to maintain economic stability amidst these challenges.</p>

          <p>College football standout Travis Hunter aspires to play both offense and defense full-time in the NFL, a rare feat in a league of specialists. Hunter, who excelled as both a cornerback and receiver at Colorado, faces skepticism from NFL teams about the feasibility of managing the workload and injury risk. Some teams are considering a limited package of plays for Hunter, but concerns remain about practice time and predictability. Hunter's insistence on playing both ways challenges the traditional paradigm of specialized roles in professional football.</p>

Meanwhile, reports indicate that Russia continues to attack civilian infrastructure despite calls for a ceasefire, and Putin unilaterally called a temporary ceasefire for the Easter weekend, but UK Defence Secretary John Healey told the House of Commons on Tuesday that British military intelligence had found no evidence of a let-up in attacks.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, marking the highest level ever recorded. The crisis is attributed to rising ocean temperatures caused by human-induced climate change, with scientists warning of severe consequences for marine ecosystems and human livelihoods. Experts emphasize the urgent need to reduce emissions from fossil fuels to protect coral reefs. Scientists forecast that at 1.5C of warming above pre-industrial levels, some 70% to 90% of the world's coral reefs could disappear, which would have an enormous impact on human livelihoods and biodiversity.</p>

Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, has called for Europe to join hands with Beijing to defend the multilateral trading system. Beijing has been ramping up efforts to win support amid rising frictions with Washington, which has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on most goods arriving in the US from China. These efforts echo President Xi Jinping's call for countries to stand up against protectionism.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets and the dollar rallied after the Trump administration signaled a potential de-escalation of the trade war with China and clarified its position on the Federal Reserve. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that he expected a "de-escalation" in the trade spat with China, and President Trump stated that tariffs would come down "substantially." The president also affirmed that he had "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, easing concerns about the independence of the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chris Mason discusses the changing landscape of the gender debate following a recent Supreme Court decision. The decision is a landmark moment, providing a new framework for arguments. The debate has been marked by intense passion and toxicity on both sides, greater than that over the Iraq war or Brexit. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, argued that the Supreme Court vindicated her long-held views on the issue.</p>
