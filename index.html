          <p>T. Rowe Price experienced a significant surge in its stock value after announcing a $1 billion deal with Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs will invest up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price common stock, aiming to acquire up to 3.5% ownership. The partnership will focus on providing individual investors, financial advisors, and retirement plan participants access to private market investment opportunities. This move comes after T. Rowe Price has faced challenges in embracing the exchange-traded fund market, and the deal aligns with President Trump's executive order promoting alternative asset access for 401(k) plans. (not investment advice) The company's shares have struggled over the years, but this partnership could be a step in the right direction for the Baltimore-based firm.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that Chinese investment in Brazil more than doubled in 2024, reaching its highest level since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese firms invested $4.18 billion across 39 projects, marking a 113% increase from the previous year, making Brazil the third-largest destination for Chinese capital globally. This surge positions Brazil as the leading destination for Chinese investment among emerging economies, with a shift towards smaller projects related to Brazil's industrial policy and energy transition. Brazil's diverse economy, encompassing industry, natural resources, and electricity, makes it an attractive destination for Chinese investment, as stated by the Brazil-China Business Council's research director.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines will discontinue service in twelve cities, following the airline's second bankruptcy filing this year. The affected cities include Albuquerque, Birmingham, Boise, Chattanooga, Oakland, Columbia, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Diego, and San Jose, and the airline is also abandoning plans to launch service in Macon, Georgia. This decision comes as Spirit faces financial challenges, including rising operational costs and debt, leading to concerns about its ability to remain in business. The airline has apologized for the inconvenience and will offer refunds to affected passengers as the company continues to navigate its restructuring process, with weak demand and adverse market conditions being significant factors.</p>

          <p>A man walking his dog discovered potential debris from the deadly midair plane collision that occurred in January in Washington, D.C. The discovery was made along the Mount Vernon Trail in Alexandria, where the man found items floating in the water that resembled airplane parts, including a lever and a leather pouch. Local police were notified, and the National Transportation Safety Board will take possession of the items for evaluation. The crash on January 29 resulted in 67 fatalities, and the FAA previously stated that an air traffic controller failed to warn the commercial plane about the Army helicopter's path.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, President Trump's housing finance chief, declined to reveal the source of his "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. On CNBC, Pulte refused to disclose his sources, citing the need to protect whistleblowers, and he pushed back against the suggestion that his actions were a form of "political weaponization". Pulte's targeting of Cook has raised concerns about potential political motivations, particularly if the tip originated within the administration. Pulte maintained that he did not need assistance in explaining his actions, despite questions about the tip's origin.</p>

          <p>The African Union estimates that Africa loses approximately $88 billion annually due to tax evasion, money laundering, and corruption, depriving governments of essential revenue for public services. Experts highlight that digital corporations and commodity traders shift profits to tax havens, while corrupt elites stash money in offshore accounts, exacerbating the problem. While efforts to curb these losses have seen some progress, such as automatic information exchange agreements, geopolitical changes and high debt levels continue to make Africa vulnerable. Illegal financial flows disproportionately affect resource-rich countries, hindering their ability to provide basic necessities and undermining governmental sovereignty.</p>

The sheriffs worry that the recruitment drive, aimed at hiring 10,000 new Ice officers, could strain local departments already facing staffing challenges.

          <p>The first trailer for Emerald Fennell's adaptation of Emily Brontë's 'Wuthering Heights' has been released, showcasing longing stares, sexual tension, and artistic choices reminiscent of Fennell's previous works. Starring Margot Robbie, Jacob Elordi, and Owen Cooper, the film appears more erotic and sexually charged than the original gothic novel. The trailer includes suggestive imagery and hints at suppressed sexual urges, with original songs by Charli XCX and a score by Anthony Willis. The casting of Elordi as Heathcliff has sparked debate, with some criticizing the decision to cast a white actor in the role.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the fifth-largest in Powerball history, and the CBS News data team analyzed where winners could take home the most and least after taxes. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to receive $820 million across 30 payments or $371 million as a lump sum after federal taxes. States with higher taxes, such as New York and Minnesota, would result in lower after-tax payouts, and the data also reveals the most and least frequently drawn numbers in the last 100 drawings.

          <p>The death toll from a recent earthquake in Afghanistan has surpassed 2,200, with the majority of casualties in Kunar province near the Pakistan border. Rescue operations are ongoing, but complicated by rockfalls and landslides triggered by aftershocks, which have blocked roads and made land travel difficult. Aid agencies are urging more support, as the earthquake has affected over 1.3 million people and destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes. Afghanistan is already grappling with a prolonged humanitarian crisis, compounded by the return of Afghan refugees and reduced foreign aid since the Taliban seized power.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants have agreed to sell a minority stake to Julia Koch and her family in a deal that values the NFL franchise at over $10 billion, the highest valuation ever for a sports team.

The Mara and Tisch families will see their holdings reduced from 50% to 45%, with John Mara remaining as president and chief executive.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the potential for organ transplants to extend lifespan during a recent meeting. Putin's translator suggested that repeated organ transplants could potentially stave off old age indefinitely, possibly allowing people to live to 150. While organ transplants save lives and advancements in medicine are increasing the lifespan of transplanted organs, significant risks and side effects exist. Scientists are exploring genetically-altered pig organs and growing new organs using human cells to overcome rejection issues, though these advances are primarily for treating illness rather than achieving immortality.</p>

          <p>Father Ted co-creator Graham Linehan is on trial in London, facing charges of harassment and criminal damage against a transgender woman. The court heard allegations that Linehan used social media to publish offensive posts about an 18-year-old trans activist, calling her a "deeply disturbed sociopath" and a "domestic terrorist". The prosecution claims Linehan also deliberately knocked the woman's phone out of her hand after she challenged him about his tweets. Linehan denies the charges, stating that he believes exposing tactics of trans activities is in the public interest as a journalist.</p>

One analyst noted that Chinese systems are affordable and integrated with AI, making them attractive to potential buyers.

          <p>President Trump has requested the Supreme Court to quickly hear an appeal seeking to overturn lower court decisions that deemed most of his tariffs illegal.

Trump is seeking arguments in early November and a final decision soon afterward, citing the potential disruption from unwinding $750 billion-$1 trillion in tariffs. The appeals court had paused its ruling until Oct. 14 to allow Trump time to appeal.</p>
