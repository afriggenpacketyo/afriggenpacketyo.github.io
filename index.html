        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors' case against former FBI Director James Comey, who faces charges of making false statements to Congress, is reportedly weakening. A central witness, law professor Daniel Richman, has provided testimony that contradicts the prosecution's claims that Comey authorized him to leak information to the media. Sources familiar with the investigation state that Richman's account presents "insurmountable problems" for the prosecution, a view shared by career investigators who recommended against pressing charges. Despite these concerns, a Trump-appointed prosecutor proceeded with the indictment, which Comey's legal team argues is politically motivated and lacks sufficient evidence for a conviction.</p>

          <p>Wharton expert Ethan Mollick cautions against trusting predictions about generative AI's impact on the job market, stating that even top research labs lack definitive answers. Speaking at a CNBC summit, Mollick emphasized that no one has long-term experience with this technology, making expertise limited and future use cases largely unknown. Corporate leaders from companies like Verizon and Sam's Club echoed this sentiment, suggesting a necessary shift in workplace culture from rewarding perfection to valuing curiosity, rapid learning, and adaptability. Mollick's primary advice for leaders is to personally engage with AI tools to understand their capabilities and limitations firsthand rather than waiting for definitive guidance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen, fell sharply following the European Commission's proposal to increase tariffs and cut import quotas on steel. The plan, designed to protect the domestic steel industry, would reduce tariff-free import volumes by 47% and double tariffs on excess imports to 50%. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) criticized the measure, warning it would lead to higher costs and have an inflationary impact on market prices. The industry group argued that while some protection for the steel industry is necessary, the proposed parameters are excessive and threaten the competitiveness of automakers.</p>

Amnesty International has condemned the junta's increasing use of paramotors for attacks as a disturbing trend, calling for urgent international action to protect civilians as the conflict continues to escalate.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing protests and a legal battle over federal troop deployment, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland, Oregon. During her visit, she met with local law enforcement leaders to discuss the security situation at the site, which has been a focal point of demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek met with Noem and reiterated her confidence in local law enforcement to manage the situation while opposing federal military intervention. The visit comes after a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to the city.</p>

These innovative materials have vast potential for practical applications, including capturing carbon dioxide, harvesting water from desert air, and storing toxic gases. The Nobel committee highlighted the trio's research, dating back to 1989, for creating custom-made materials with new functions that offer previously unforeseen opportunities in science and technology.</p>

          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, has promised a sustained "marathon of reforms" to address a federal budget shortfall exceeding €30 billion. Klingbeil stated that his Social Democratic Party would support cuts to welfare benefits as part of a package deal with the Christian Democrats, but stressed that reforms must be fair and not disproportionately burden one segment of society. He argued that the government must go beyond a single "autumn of reforms," insisting that dismantling bureaucracy and accelerating planning processes will require the coalition's focus for its entire term. This announcement signals a period of significant fiscal adjustments and political negotiations within Germany's governing coalition.</p>

The comments were in response to Mamdani's statement on the anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, in which he condemned the attack as a war crime but also accused the Israeli government of waging a "genocidal war" with U.S. complicity.</p>

The indictment, brought forth by a Trump-appointed prosecutor, alleges Comey was untruthful during a 2020 Senate hearing about authorizing anonymous leaks to the media. Comey maintains his innocence and is expected to plead not guilty, with his defense likely arguing the prosecution is politically motivated. The arraignment will formally present the charges, allow for a plea, and set the stage for potential pre-trial motions, including a possible motion to dismiss the case.</p>

The initiative aims to increase convenience for patients by eliminating a separate trip to a pharmacy, a barrier that often results in prescriptions going unfilled.

          <p>Patrick Henry, though often considered a secondary figure among the Founding Fathers, played a pivotal role in sparking the American Revolution through his unparalleled power as an orator. His speeches, most famously the "Liberty or Death" address, abandoned the era's classical, reason-based rhetoric in favor of an emotional, evangelical style that appealed directly to the hearts of ordinary citizens. This democratic approach was revolutionary in itself, mobilizing popular support for independence in a way that the more reserved and scholarly Founders could not. By transforming political discourse, Henry not only made the revolution seem inevitable but also helped shape a new, more populist form of American politics.</p>

His hardline stance against American independence stemmed from a principled belief that conceding would unravel the British Empire and violate his constitutional duty. While his stubbornness contributed to the conflict, he was not a simple despot but a ruler grappling with an unprecedented challenge to his authority and the integrity of his kingdom.</p>

Once inseparable confidants, their political differences hardened into a painful estrangement, with William remaining a staunch Loyalist to the British Crown. This loyalty led to his imprisonment by revolutionaries, during which Benjamin made no effort to intervene. The conflict was not just political but deeply personal, with Benjamin feeling betrayed by his son's opposition in a cause where his life and fortune were at stake.

After the war, these Black Loyalists faced a new struggle, with many evacuating to places like Nova Scotia and later Sierra Leone, establishing the largest free Black communities of their time.

          <p>A persistent literary debate surrounds author Jane Austen's perspective on slavery, with her 1814 novel *Mansfield Park* at the center of the discussion. The novel is her only work to explicitly mention the slave trade, as the wealth of the central Bertram family comes from a plantation in Antigua. Scholars like Edward Said have argued that the novel reflects an imperialist worldview that normalizes the atrocities of slavery, pointing to a key scene where a question about the slave trade is met with a "dead silence." Other academics contend that Austen embedded coded anti-slavery messages within the text, while some suggest she held a more moderate, though still problematic, view common in her era.</p>

          <h2>Multiple Bear Encounters in Japan Result in Injuries and One Fatality</h2>

          <p>A series of bear encounters across Japan has heightened public safety concerns, resulting in two injuries and one suspected death. In central Japan, a 4.5-foot bear entered a grocery store, injuring two men before it was captured, while in the northern Iwate region, a man was found dead in a suspected mauling. These incidents are part of a significant increase in bear sightings and attacks in Japan, which experts attribute to factors like climate change impacting food sources and a declining rural human population allowing bears to expand their habitat. Last year saw a record 219 attacks and six deaths, prompting a need for new human-wildlife management strategies.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, now a Category 2 storm, is gradually weakening as it moves parallel to Mexico's Pacific coast but continues to pose a threat with dangerous surf conditions. The National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and issued a tropical storm watch for a portion of the Baja California Sur peninsula. While the storm's center is expected to remain offshore, large swells generated by Priscilla are causing life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coasts of southwestern Mexico and the Baja peninsula. Forecasters anticipate the storm will continue to lose strength over the next 48 hours.</p>

          <p>The espionage case against two men accused of spying for China has collapsed, with the UK's Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) attributing the failure to the government's inability to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat. To prosecute under the Official Secrets Act, a legal precedent requires proving the country in question was an enemy or threat at the time of the alleged offenses. Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements from the government that met this threshold, leading to the charges being dropped. The situation has prompted criticism and questions about the government's stance and legal strategy regarding China.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, marking its most significant rally since the 1970s. Investors are flocking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset due to concerns over global economic instability, trade tensions initiated by U.S. tariffs, and delays in economic data release from the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. This rally is also fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar and strategic purchasing by central banks seeking to diversify away from U.S. treasuries. Analysts note that while short-term uncertainty is a key driver, the long-term trend is supported by strong institutional demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Established by Alfred Nobel's will, the prize has been awarded to world leaders, humanitarians, and organizations working on issues from arms control to climate change. Donald Trump has expressed a desire to win the award, citing his administration's role in brokering international agreements, and has been nominated by figures like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While nominees are kept secret for 50 years, experts suggest the committee may be hesitant to award the prize for recent achievements, though precedents for surprising choices exist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pumpkin, a quintessential symbol of American autumn, has a history as winding as its vines. Originating from the Greek word "pepon," the term evolved through French before being applied by European settlers to the gourds cultivated by Indigenous peoples in the Americas for millennia. For centuries, "pumpkin" was also used as a derogatory term, implying someone was empty-headed or oafish. However, by the late 19th century, urbanization transformed the gourd into a nostalgic icon of a romanticized agrarian past, a cultural association that remains powerful today and supports the very small family farms it has come to represent.</p>

          <p>A new research paper challenges the long-held belief that Sir Ernest Shackleton's polar exploration ship, the Endurance, was an exceptionally strong vessel for its time. Jukka Tuhkuri, a professor of arctic marine technology, argues that the ship had several structural weaknesses that made it unsuitable for the compressive forces of pack ice. Citing historical records and a technical analysis, the paper suggests the ship, originally designed for arctic tourism, lacked key reinforcements found in other polar vessels. Tuhkuri contends that these design flaws, not just the loss of its rudder, were the primary reason the ship was crushed by ice and sank in 1915.</p>

During a Senate hearing, Noh stated that the department is currently reviewing the agreement to ensure it aligns with President Trump's "America first" foreign policy. He suggested that "common sense" modifications could be made to strengthen Pillar I of the arrangement, which involves providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, even before the current review is completed.

According to a 2023 EU report, Germany saw the bloc's largest increase in reported anti-Black discrimination. Economically, immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa face significant disparities, with higher unemployment rates and a wider pay gap compared to native-born citizens. Sociologists suggest that public discourse can intensify hiring discrimination, and activists are calling for more comprehensive data collection to understand and combat the systemic challenges faced by Black people in the country.</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and support staff have been successfully brought to safety after being stranded by a weekend blizzard on the Chinese side of Mount Everest. The severe storm hit a high-altitude area over 16,000 feet, cutting off access and trapping the large group in a valley. A rescue operation was launched, with teams providing food, medicine, and oxygen to those affected. By Tuesday, all 580 hikers and over 300 local workers had been safely evacuated from the mountain. The incident prompted the temporary closure of the scenic area during a major national holiday week.</p>
