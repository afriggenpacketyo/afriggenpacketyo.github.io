          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individual who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Investigators have recovered a high-powered bolt action rifle believed to be the weapon used in what authorities are calling a targeted, political assassination. The suspect reportedly fired from a rooftop before fleeing the campus, prompting an extensive manhunt involving local and federal law enforcement. The attack has been widely condemned across the political spectrum as officials vow to bring the perpetrator to justice.</p>

          <p>An alleged drug-trafficking boat destroyed by the U.S. military last week was reportedly attempting to turn back towards Venezuela when it was struck, killing 11 people. The Trump administration claims the vessel was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, a designated terrorist organization, and that the strike was a lawful action to protect the U.S. from drug trafficking. However, Venezuela's interior minister has denied that any of the deceased were gang members or drug traffickers, accusing the U.S. of murder. The White House has notified Congress that the president acted within his constitutional authority, but the incident continues to draw scrutiny.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted that Spirit Airlines is headed for bankruptcy, asserting that the ultra-low-cost carrier business model is no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby stated that the model, which relies on low base fares and numerous additional fees, is disliked by customers and unsustainable. His comments follow Spirit's recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and come as larger airlines successfully compete with their own basic economy fares. Kirby's critique suggests a major shift in the aviation industry, where legacy carriers are reclaiming market share from budget airlines.</p>

The father, Edwin Johnson, was initially arrested on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter and child neglect before the charges were upgraded to murder.

          <p>In the aftermath of the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, members of the U.S. Congress are heightening security measures and altering their public schedules. Several lawmakers, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have postponed or moved outdoor events indoors, citing an abundance of caution amid rising concerns over political violence. The shooting has prompted a bipartisan re-evaluation of security protocols for public figures, with some representatives stating they will resume carrying firearms for personal protection.

The article argues that by selectively focusing on left-wing violence and ignoring incidents like the January 6th Capitol assault, Trump is creating a misleading narrative for political gain.

This rate of return fails to keep pace with inflation, meaning the money's purchasing power is effectively decreasing over time.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has abruptly withdrawn a state bill that would have significantly altered Measure ULA, the city's voter-approved tax on high-value property sales. The proposed legislation, which was pulled just hours before its first committee vote, aimed to reduce the tax burden on the sale of newly constructed commercial and apartment buildings. Bass stated the bill was pulled due to a need for further amendments and will be reintroduced in January. The move comes after strong opposition from the coalition that backed Measure ULA, who argued the changes would gut funding for crucial homelessness and housing programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is urgently asking a federal appeals court to allow the president to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before a critical interest rate meeting next week. A lower court previously blocked the firing, which was based on allegations of mortgage fraud, ruling that the president had not provided a legally permissible cause for removal. The Justice Department is now arguing that the president has broad discretion in removing federal officials and that the court should not interfere. The move is seen as part of President Trump's broader effort to exert more influence over the central bank's monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>A detailed timeline of events reveals the sequence of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The suspect reportedly arrived on campus around 11:52 a.m. MT, just before the event began. At approximately 12:23 p.m., Kirk was struck by a single shot, and video footage shows a person running across the roof of a nearby building moments later. Dispatch audio from 12:27 p.m. described a person in black tactical gear with a long rifle on the roof. Authorities believe the shooter then jumped from the building and fled, prompting a large-scale search that is still ongoing.</p>

          <p>A potential offer from Paramount Skydance to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery would consolidate a vast and valuable portfolio of entertainment and sports media assets. The deal would combine Paramount's franchises like "Star Trek" and "Mission: Impossible" with Warner Bros. Discovery's iconic properties, including the DC superhero universe, "Harry Potter," and "Game of Thrones." Furthermore, it would merge Paramount's exclusive UFC rights with WBD's broadcast rights for the NHL, MLB, and March Madness basketball. Such a merger would create a media giant with an immense library of intellectual property and a formidable presence in live sports broadcasting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent increase in the U.S. inflation rate to 2.9% in August is prompting investors to reconsider their strategies, with gold being a prominent option. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset because it tends to hold its value, and can even appreciate, during periods of inflation when the purchasing power of currency declines. This ability to act as an inflation hedge can help protect a portfolio from market volatility. However, financial advisors typically recommend that investors allocate only a small portion of their portfolio, generally no more than 10%, to the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick had a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship that may have inadvertently helped his score. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play. Witnesses reported seeing two people run out of the bushes with a golf ball, leading to the conclusion it was stolen. This allowed Fitzpatrick to take a penalty drop instead of playing a provisional ball from a worse position, which he believes saved him at least one stroke in his six-under-par round.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging that the ride-hailing company systematically discriminates against passengers with disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The complaint claims Uber and its drivers routinely refuse service to individuals who use service animals or stowable wheelchairs, and sometimes impose improper fees or engage in demeaning behavior. The DOJ is seeking a jury trial, monetary damages, and a court order to force Uber to modify its policies. Uber has stated that it has a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and disagrees with the allegations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has been sent on a season-long loan to Turkish club Trabzonspor. The move was completed just before the close of the Turkish transfer window. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in 2023 to be the team's starting keeper, had not featured in any of the club's first three Premier League games this season under new manager Ruben Amorim. His only appearance was in a Carabao Cup loss, signaling his fall in the team's pecking order and prompting the temporary move to secure more playing time.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been convicted of attempting a coup and sentenced to 27 years in prison, a landmark verdict in a trial that has captivated the nation. The Supreme Court found him guilty of leading a criminal plot to overturn his 2022 election loss, which culminated in his supporters storming government buildings. The trial has been praised by his critics as a necessary step to protect Brazil's young democracy from authoritarianism, while his supporters, including U.S. President Trump, have decried it as a political witch hunt. The ruling is expected to deepen the country's profound political divisions.</p>
