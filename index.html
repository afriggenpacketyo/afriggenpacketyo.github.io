          <p>Marcus Monzo is on trial for allegedly murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin in Hainault. The prosecution stated that Monzo had a clear intention to kill multiple people, regardless of their age, and that Daniel was simply walking to school when he was fatally attacked with a sword. The court heard that Daniel suffered a devastating injury, and Monzo is also accused of attacking other individuals in the vicinity, including breaking into a couple's home. The trial continues to determine Monzo's state of mind and whether his actions were influenced by self-induced intoxication or a pre-existing mental condition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates following a weak ADP jobs report. Trump expressed his frustration on Truth Social, stating that Powell must act to lower rates and that Europe has lowered rates nine times. The ADP report indicated a significant slowdown in private sector hiring, falling far below expectations, which intensifies Trump's push for more accommodative monetary policy. Trump's comments come shortly after a meeting with Powell, where he reportedly criticized the Fed's current stance on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Cage questioned the disregard for immigration law in the name of tolerance, stating that the attack was not a surprise and that officials should have addressed Soliman's overstayed visa.

This marks a significant shift from previous reports that concluded Bulgaria did not meet the convergence criteria due to high inflation.

          <p>An inquiry by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has found that train firms are unfairly penalizing passengers for minor and genuine mistakes in ticket purchases. The ORR emphasized the complexity of Britain's fare system and called for rail firms to stop taking disproportionate action against travelers. Numerous examples are cited of passengers facing hefty fines and threats of prosecution for unintentional errors, highlighting the need for a more understanding and consistent approach. Rail Minister Lord Peter Hendy acknowledged the issue and stated the government's plan to simplify ticketing and develop a state-owned rail operator.</p>

          <p>A man is on trial for allegedly carrying out a series of unprovoked attacks with a sword in Hainault, resulting in the death of a 14-year-old schoolboy and injuries to five others. Marcus Arduini Monzo is accused of ambushing Daniel Anjorin as he walked to school, inflicting fatal injuries. The prosecution asserts that Monzo had a clear intention to kill and that his actions were driven by self-induced intoxication. The defense contends that Monzo suffered from a pre-existing condition that made him vulnerable to psychotic episodes.</p>
