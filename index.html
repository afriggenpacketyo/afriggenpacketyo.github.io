        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, are reportedly leaving their positions in the Trump White House. Waltz faced scrutiny after mistakenly including a journalist in a Signal chat, revealing sensitive discussions about military plans in Yemen. Wong, who served in roles related to North Korea, helped negotiate Trump's summit with Kim Jong Un. The White House has not yet commented on their departures, but sources indicate they will leave soon, raising questions about potential shifts in national security strategy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, in one of his final acts as an advisor on government efficiency, has publicly questioned the $2.5 billion renovation of the Federal Reserve building. He stated that the central bank's spending on the project "sounds high" and should be subject to scrutiny. The Fed initiated the project in 2021 to address necessary upgrades, building codes, technology updates, and energy efficiency. Musk suggested that the cost overruns should be part of a broader examination of government waste, even though the Fed is not directly funded by taxpayers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has formally requested the Trump administration to establish a tariff exclusion process, aiming to shield small businesses from "irreparable harm" and prevent a potential recession. The letter, addressed to key trade officials, suggests automatically lifting tariffs on small business importers and products not domestically available. While the Chamber acknowledges concerns about government overreach, it believes immediate relief is needed, as court challenges take too long. The White House deputy chief of staff indicated the administration is unlikely to grant short-term tariff relief, instead focusing on broader tax cuts for small businesses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its partnerships with local law enforcement to bolster immigration enforcement, as demonstrated by a six-day immigration sweep in Florida that led to over 1,100 arrests. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is collaborating with state agencies through the 287(g) program, allowing local officers to make immigration arrests. While supporters argue this expands ICE's capabilities, critics like the American Civil Liberties Union warn of potential civil rights violations and financial burdens on localities. The expansion of local law enforcement's role in immigration enforcement raises concerns about the program's impact on public safety and community relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automakers such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant sales increases in April, driven by consumers buying vehicles ahead of potential tariff-related price hikes. This "tariff fear-buying" was fueled by special discounts and promises from automakers not to raise prices immediately. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices increased, with economists warning that higher costs and reduced vehicle availability could lead to lower sales in the future. The long-term impact of Trump's tariffs on the auto industry remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected approximately $1.7 million in bail from migrants arrested for trespassing, many of whom were deported before their court appearances and thus forfeited their bail. This practice, part of Governor Abbott's Operation Lone Star, has provided a new revenue stream for the county, leading to increased funding for law enforcement and raises for county officials. While officials argue they are deterring illegal crossings and providing justice for landowners, critics contend that the county is profiting from migrants who are unable to attend court due to deportation.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and his department have made misleading statements, including the false claim that the MMR vaccine contains "aborted fetus debris." Kennedy has also urged parents to "do their own research," a phrase often associated with vaccine misinformation. The rubella vaccine, like many vaccines, is produced using decades-old sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s. Experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines to be unethical because it would effectively deny a patient a known intervention while potentially exposing them to a dangerous disease.</p>

          <p>"The Surfer," starring Nicolas Cage, is a sunny beach noir film about an unnamed surfer who returns to his childhood beach in Australia only to be driven to the edge of madness by local surf bullies. Cage's character sacrifices everything to reclaim his spot, leading to a descent into absurdity and rage. The film is inspired by a real-life surf gang and explores themes of tribalism, loss, and the commodification of beauty.</p>

          <p>U.S. applications for jobless benefits rose to a two-month high, indicating potential weakening in the labor market amidst fears of an economic slowdown induced by tariffs. While layoffs remain historically low, the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits has climbed to its highest level since November 2021. Concerns about a global economic slowdown and the impact of federal agency job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are contributing to the uncertainty.</p>

Prosecutors allege the pair filmed the felling and took a wedge of the trunk as a "trophy," with evidence linking Graham's car to the scene.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With savings rates higher than they have been in years, certificates of deposit (CDs) can be a way to ensure that your money is making the most returns possible. To maximize CD returns, consider online banks that often offer higher interest rates due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs, ranging from six months to one year, may provide better rates than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by investing in a mix of short- and long-term options, can also help optimize savings while taking advantage of current rates. (not investment advice)</p>
