        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report indicated slower hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump alleged the numbers were politically manipulated, a claim disputed by economists and some Republican lawmakers who warned the move could undermine the credibility of federal economic data. The dismissal has been criticized for politicizing a traditionally nonpartisan agency responsible for crucial economic indicators, raising concerns about data integrity and market stability. The White House has named a deputy commissioner to serve in an acting capacity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting raids based on factors like race or speaking Spanish in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion that an individual is in the country illegally before detaining them, finding that the broad profiles used previously violated the Fourth Amendment. This legal battle stems from controversial sweeps during the Trump administration that caused widespread fear in the region's Latino community. The administration criticized the ruling, stating that its enforcement targets individuals based on their illegal status, not their ethnicity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump, for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The investigation follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions, particularly the timing of his investigations before the 2024 election, constituted illegal political activity intended to harm Trump's campaign. The Hatch Act limits the political activities of federal employees to maintain impartiality. Smith, who resigned in January, had previously maintained that his investigations were not politically motivated.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reportedly launched an investigation into allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, 'Strictly Come Dancing'. The claims were detailed in a legal submission from a former contestant, with reports suggesting the alleged drug use was widely discussed among the show's cast and crew. In response, the BBC stated it has clear protocols for handling serious complaints and has hired an external law firm to assist with the probe. This follows a year of controversies for the program, which has recently implemented new welfare measures to support its participants and production team.</p>

          <p>Rescuers at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have recovered the remains of one of five miners who were trapped following a partial collapse on Thursday. The incident was triggered by a magnitude 4.2 seismic event that also resulted in one other fatality outside the mine. Over 100 rescuers are involved in the intensive search effort, delving up to 1,200 meters underground, while normal operations at the state-owned mine remain suspended. Chilean President Gabriel Boric met with the families of the trapped miners, assuring them that all available resources are being deployed in the ongoing rescue mission.</p>

This event highlights a growing threat across the Alps, where climate change is making such disasters more frequent and unpredictable, according to scientists. The high cost of rebuilding and protecting these vulnerable mountain communities has sparked a debate in Switzerland about whether some villages should be abandoned.

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30 million, despite his recent statements expressing a desire to remain with the club. The potential sale is linked to United's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While the club insists it can acquire new players without first selling, offloading Hojlund would help ensure compliance with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. If Sesko were to join, Hojlund's role would likely be marginalized, making a transfer a practical move for both the player and the club. (not investment advice)</p>

The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift intended to curry favor with the British Prime Minister during World War II. While long-held rumors claimed the animal died from shell-shock due to a nearby Nazi submarine attack, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Logbooks from the ship's attendant show that water and air temperatures climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as the vessel crossed the equator, indicating the platypus likely succumbed to heat stress.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people have been arrested following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators at protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers across England. Tensions were high in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, where police worked to keep the opposing factions separated. The protests highlight the contentious issue of housing asylum seekers in hotels, a practice the government aims to phase out by 2029. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has also announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process in an effort to "restore order and control" to the system and reduce the overall number of cases.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a U.S. Army veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda. Authorities have located the suspect's vehicle but he remains at large, with the search focused on a mountainous area west of the town. The suspect, who lived next door to the bar, allegedly knew the victims, and the bar's owner suggested he may have "snapped." The incident has left the small, tight-knit community shaken as local, state, and federal agencies collaborate in the search.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin harshly criticized his players' mentality and effort following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening Scottish Premiership match. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he described as a "mentality problem" and players with egos who reverted to type. He specifically called out two unnamed players for not following the tactical plan, expressing deep disappointment with the performance. The public criticism so early in the season has surprised pundits and signals significant issues within the squad as they begin their campaign.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is unfolding at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters are battling for a single, multi-million dollar NFL contract. Incumbent punter Matt Hayball is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, with both athletes being graduates of the ProKick Australia academy. This cutthroat situation is a recurring ritual for the Saints, who have favored rookie punters in recent years. Despite the intense pressure, the two maintain a friendly rivalry, understanding that only one will secure a place on the final 53-man roster later this month.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a sharp return from the injured list, striking out eight batters over five innings in his first start since early in the season. However, his promising performance was marred by two home runs from Tampa Bay Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite Snell flashing his Cy Young-winning potential, the Dodgers' offense was quiet, leading to a 4-0 loss. The outing was seen as a positive step for Snell and the team's late-season rotation depth.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested nearly 1,000 undocumented foreign nationals for allegedly working illegally at the Sheba Gold Mine in Mpumalanga province. The week-long operation, titled "Vala Umgodi," targeted the pervasive issue of illegal mining in the country, where thousands of abandoned mines have become hotspots for such activities. Those arrested, many of whom are from neighboring countries like Eswatini and Mozambique, will face charges for immigration violations and potentially illegal mining. The mine's owner has welcomed the arrests, stating that the illegal activity, which fuels gold theft, will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Gaza's Health Ministry reports that at least 325 people have been killed by Israeli forces over the past week while trying to access desperately needed food aid. The deadly search for sustenance continues despite Israeli assurances of humanitarian pauses, as a UN-backed report confirms a famine is unfolding in the territory. Aid agencies state that deliveries are insufficient and often looted by armed gangs and hungry crowds before proper distribution can occur. The crisis prompted a visit from U.S. officials, but deadly incidents near aid distribution sites have continued, drawing international condemnation.</p>
