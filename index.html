        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have officially confirmed the details of a new trade framework aimed at de-escalating economic tensions. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, Beijing will review and approve applications for items under its export control rules, while Washington has agreed to cancel a range of restrictive measures. This agreement, which builds upon earlier talks in Geneva and London, seeks to stabilize the fraught relationship, though experts advise caution, noting a lack of clarity on the specifics of relaxing rare earth export curbs. The deal aims to resolve disputes that caused a previous 90-day tariff suspension to falter.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs. The market responded positively to a White House announcement that President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which was set to expire. Investor sentiment was also bolstered by a holding ceasefire between Israel and Iran, contributing to a broader sense of stability in international affairs. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the yen as the Japanese currency, typically a safe-haven asset, was sold amid hopes for progress in trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a reported rocky relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft, Son affirmed SoftBank's commitment to deepen its partnership, regardless of OpenAI's corporate structure.

          <p>Following the arrest of two Chinese nationals for allegedly smuggling a crop-killing fungus, a former Department of Homeland Security expert has warned about the potential for "agroterrorism" to disrupt the U.S. food supply. The expert, Kristofor Healey, defined agroterrorism as the intentional introduction of biological organisms to attack key agricultural resources, calling it a significant threat to national security. The arrested individuals are accused of smuggling Fusarium graminearum, a toxic fungus harmful to major crops and humans. The article highlights concerns that such actions could be part of a broader strategy by foreign adversaries to target vulnerable U.S. infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's car production plummeted in May to its lowest level for that month since 1949, excluding the pandemic lockdown period. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported a nearly one-third drop from the previous year, largely attributing the decline to new 25% U.S. tariffs that caused exports to the American market to halve. Major manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover had to suspend shipments, severely impacting output. However, the industry group expressed cautious optimism, as a new deal set to reduce the tariffs on a quota of British cars is expected to be implemented soon.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified crackdown on immigration is causing concern among U.S. business owners who rely on immigrant labor and economists who fear it could stifle economic growth. With nearly one in five U.S. workers being an immigrant, policies targeting both undocumented individuals and those with temporary work permits are creating workforce shortages in sectors like cleaning, caregiving, and construction. Business leaders report losing employees and facing difficulties in finding replacements, which could lead to slower growth and higher inflation. Analysts warn that these policies risk transforming the U.S. into a more stagnant and less dynamic economy by choking off a critical supply of workers.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a sharp 9.1% year-on-year decline in May, the most significant drop since last October, signaling that government stimulus measures are not yet reviving corporate earnings. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the fall to insufficient domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods, with the automotive manufacturing sector seeing an 11.9% profit drop. Despite a recent recovery in retail sales, businesses have not seen increased profits due to depressed price levels and intense price wars. Economists suggest this data is unlikely to trigger immediate, large-scale stimulus from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

North, who is now playing in France, stated that this moment, along with his spectacular solo try in the first Test, is what fans most frequently remember. He considers the 2013 tour, which the Lions won 2-1, the period where he played the best rugby of his career.</p>

His comments were made in the context of recent global events, including U.S. operations in the Middle East and the subsequent ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

The program, part of the Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union treaty, grants 280 Tuvaluans permanent residency in Australia each year in response to the existential threat of climate-related displacement. The high number of applicants suggests the program will be vastly oversubscribed, highlighting the severe situation facing the low-lying Pacific island nation.

          <p>A retrospective on Keir Starmer's first year as UK Prime Minister reveals a term that began with a landslide victory but quickly became defined by crises and political challenges. Despite preparations for office, his government faced a difficult inheritance, including wars and economic strain, and was criticized for a lack of decisive direction, often launching reviews instead of implementing policy. The analysis points to key struggles, including an unpopular cut to winter fuel payments, the political fallout from the Southport riots, and the dismissal of his chief of staff, Sue Gray. While finding a more confident footing on the world stage, Starmer now faces a major battle to regain domestic momentum.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has executed a significant U-turn on its proposed welfare state reforms following immense pressure from a large rebellion within his own party. The planned cuts, which Downing Street had insisted were necessary for the long-term sustainability of the benefits system, faced widespread opposition from Labour MPs. The capitulation, which came after days of growing public and private dissent, represents a major political setback for the less-than-a-year-old government.

          <p>The 50th anniversary of a nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil is prompting renewed debate over its legacy and future. Signed in 1975, the treaty aimed to build eight German-designed nuclear power plants in Brazil but has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with only one plant, Angra-2, ever becoming operational. Critics point to the project's failures and environmental risks, while the Green Party has long advocated for terminating the agreement. The debate is now influenced by Russia's war in Ukraine, as a French company produces fuel rods for Brazil in Germany using uranium supplied by Russia's state-owned Rosatom.</p>

Yoo, who was a student at the university, had claimed she was bullied and insulted by other students, though the court found no evidence that the victims were involved.

Despite the risk of arrest and fines, these individuals argue that the official legal process for reintroduction is too bureaucratic and slow, given the urgent climate and biodiversity crisis. Beavers, which were hunted to extinction in Britain 400 years ago, are known as "ecosystem engineers" for their ability to create wetlands, reduce flooding, and clean water.
