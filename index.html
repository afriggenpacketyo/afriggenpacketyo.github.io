          <p>AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave's first earnings report since its IPO revealed revenue exceeding expectations, with a remarkable 420% year-over-year increase. The company anticipates robust growth for 2025, projecting revenues between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. CoreWeave's CEO, Mike Intrator, attributed the higher capital spending to new clients acquiring additional infrastructure. The article notes that OpenAI committed to a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion with CoreWeave during the first quarter. The company's future growth hinges on securing adequate power for its expanding data centers, with plans to more than double deployed power by year's end.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly obstructing immigration authorities, escalating tensions between local and federal entities over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of helping a man evade ICE agents by escorting him and his lawyer through a back door of her courtroom after learning agents were seeking his arrest. Dugan claims judicial immunity and filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing the prosecution is unconstitutional. The state Supreme Court has suspended her from the bench, and she is expected to plead not guilty at her arraignment. The man in question had illegally reentered the U.S. after deportation and was in court for a domestic abuse hearing.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The brothers previously faced life sentences without parole, claiming they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse by their parents. Judge Michael Jesic struck the special circumstance of the original sentence, leading to the resentencing, a decision praised by the brothers' attorney, Mark Geragos. The Los Angeles County District Attorney expressed opposition to the resentencing, highlighting its implications for justice and the families involved. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings in June to determine parole eligibility, sending final reports to the governor for clemency consideration.</p>

          <p>China is initiating recruitment programs aimed at attracting Chinese-born researchers considering leaving the United States, spurred by funding cuts and perceived declining academic freedom. One program offers postdoctoral positions with salaries approaching $100,000 per year for three years, significantly higher than typical postdoctoral pay in both China and the U.S. The move comes as scientists in the U.S. experience increased scrutiny and challenges. A leading Chinese-American biologist notes that many are contemplating such moves but are unlikely to disclose their decisions prematurely.</p>

          <p>A dire food crisis is unfolding in Gaza, with nearly half a million people facing starvation due to the ongoing Israeli blockade. The blockade, intended to pressure Hamas to release Israeli hostages, has halted humanitarian aid for over ten weeks, despite hundreds of truckloads of supplies waiting at the border. The UN World Food Programme has exhausted its supplies, forcing Palestinians to grind pasta and lentils for flour, with wheat flour selling for exorbitant prices.

Hardliners are demanding changes to the Medicaid provisions, specifically the work requirements, which are set to take effect in 2029. Representative Andy Harris criticized the plan as a "joke," while other Republicans expressed concerns about the state and local tax deductions cap. Democrats voiced strong opposition, warning that millions of Americans will lose insurance coverage under the GOP plan.

The changes aim to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029. This decision marks a shift from Newsom's previous commitment to expanding healthcare access to all, regardless of immigration status.</p>

The campaign is based on a new report claiming mifepristone causes high rates of health complications, which reproductive health experts dispute. Republican Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a bill to reimpose restrictions and allow patients to sue telehealth abortion providers. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals, with the DOJ asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access, but not explicitly defending mifepristone's safety.

          <p>A New Jersey couple, Branndon Mosley and Brenda Spencer, have been arrested for allegedly abusing and confining a child in their home for years. The victim, now 18, escaped with help from a neighbor. The victim stated that the abuse began in approximately 2018, with Spencer removing them from school and confining them to the home. Allegations include being forced to live in a dog crate and a padlocked bathroom, as well as sexual assault by Mosley. Another child in the home was also removed from school years earlier. Authorities say the case highlights the need to revisit homeschooling laws.</p>

He said his opinions about vaccines are irrelevant and that he doesn’t think people should be taking medical advice from him. Kennedy's hearing also addressed the White House budget proposal to cut tens of billions from the health department and slashing the federal government’s biomedical research arms in particular.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to charge monthly premiums for undocumented immigrants and halt new enrollments in the state's healthcare program, Medi-Cal, as soon as January 2026. The move is part of a broader effort to address a state budget shortfall. Newsom had previously defended the expansion of healthcare benefits to low-income individuals regardless of immigration status, but the rising costs of the program have led to these proposed changes. The premium would be $100 a month for those currently enrolled.</p>
