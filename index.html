          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semi-finals following the withdrawal of her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, due to a leg injury. This sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American player Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in a decisive straight-sets victory, showcasing strong form throughout the tournament. Vondrousova's withdrawal is another unfortunate setback in a career that has been frequently hampered by injuries, preventing a competitive quarter-final match from taking place.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a new law in England banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. The prohibition will apply to various retail points, including shops, restaurants, and online stores, targeting popular brands like Red Bull and Monster. This legislative action addresses growing concerns from health experts, parents, and teachers about the negative health impacts of these drinks on children, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. The move aims to formalize what has largely been a voluntary ban by most supermarkets until now.</p>

          <p>The musician Pink, also known as Alecia Moore, recently shared that she contracted an E. coli infection while on vacation with her family. She posted a photo on social media showing her receiving a vitamin IV drip, indicating she was in the process of recovery. Despite the health scare, she maintained a positive outlook, joking about killing the bacteria with friends, her daughter, and red wine. According to the CDC, E. coli can cause a range of illnesses and is commonly contracted from contaminated food or water, which appears to be the case in this situation.</p>

Initially, these robotaxi tests will be conducted with human safety drivers behind the wheel to monitor the vehicles and ensure safety. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to roll out its driverless ride-hailing service across the United States, following commercial launches in cities like Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin. The company will use a fleet of electric Jaguar and Geely vehicles for the tests, aiming to validate its technology for future fully autonomous services.</p>

          <p>Veteran Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after she was fired by President Donald Trump, a move unprecedented in the history of the central bank. Lowell, known for representing high-profile clients from both political parties like Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner, is challenging what he calls an overreach of presidential authority. The lawsuit argues that the unsubstantiated allegations of mortgage fraud used as justification for Cook's removal are not sufficient cause under the Federal Reserve Act. This case places Lowell at the forefront of a significant legal fight over the independence of federal regulators.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged a tow truck driver, Bobby Nunez, with theft of government property in Los Angeles. Nunez allegedly stole a federal agent's vehicle while officers were arresting TikTok influencer Tatiana Mafla-Martinez, who is suspected of being in the country illegally. The arrest, which was captured on a livestream, drew significant attention as witnesses claimed officers used excessive force. Authorities state Nunez interfered with the arrest by towing the agent's car, laughing and recording the officer who gave chase on foot.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested he will send National Guard troops to Chicago to address violent crime, stating, "We're going in." This potential deployment continues his administration's controversial use of federal forces in American cities, following similar actions in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker responded by calling the president's comments "unhinged" and stated he would not request federal troops, preparing for a legal challenge if necessary. The move raises legal questions regarding presidential authority over state National Guard forces, which are typically controlled by governors.</p>

          <p>A new cryptocurrency, WLFI, issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial, has added approximately $5 billion to the family's on-paper wealth despite the token's value falling since its launch. The Trump family holds 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, which are currently locked and cannot be sold. This venture highlights President Trump's increasing support for the crypto industry during his second term, a shift from his previous skepticism. The move has raised concerns among watchdog groups about potential conflicts of interest between his personal business ventures and his administration's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student and prominent campus activist, has returned to Columbia University to begin his graduate studies four months after being detained and nearly deported by the Trump administration. Mahdawi, a key organizer of student protests against the war in Gaza, was arrested during a naturalization interview but later released by a federal judge who cited the potential chilling effect on free speech. Vowing to remain outspoken, Mahdawi expressed excitement about his return but also disappointment in what he perceives as a lack of support from the university administration during his detention.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has authorized approximately 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges in an effort to clear a massive case backlog. This decision follows a recent change that lowered the qualification requirements, removing the need for prior immigration law experience. The Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement has overwhelmed the nation's immigration courts, which have also seen over 100 judges depart in the last nine months. The military lawyers will undergo about two weeks of training before they begin hearing cases involving deportations and green card revocations.</p>

          <p>Howard Webb, the chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has acknowledged that the decision to disallow a goal for Fulham in their recent match against Chelsea was a "misjudgement." The goal, scored by Josh King, was overturned after a lengthy VAR review identified a minor foul in the build-up. Webb stated that such decisions should only be made when evidence is very clear and that this particular intervention did not meet the high bar required for VAR to overrule an on-field decision. The incident was a key talking point in the match, which Chelsea went on to win 2-0.</p>

Drake has a history of high-profile, and often unsuccessful, bets on major sporting events, including a losing wager on Taylor Fritz against Sinner in a previous US Open final.

While the decision could lead to the refund of billions of dollars in duties, the tariffs remain in place pending a Supreme Court appeal, so businesses are maintaining a cautious, wait-and-see approach. Logistics professionals report that most shippers are not changing their strategies yet, as the final outcome is unknown. If the ruling is upheld, the process for refunding the collected tariffs could be complex and lengthy for both the government and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump argued the relocation to Huntsville, known as "Rocket City" for its historical role in NASA's rocket development, will boost the local economy and strengthen national defense. The move also carries political undertones, as Alabama is a reliably Republican state, a fact the president acknowledged during his announcement.</p>

While the immediate appeal was denied, the council can still apply directly to the higher court, and a full hearing for a permanent injunction is scheduled for October.
