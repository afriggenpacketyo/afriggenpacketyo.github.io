          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the installation of a makeup studio adjacent to the Pentagon press briefing room at a cost of several thousand dollars, sparking cost-cutting concerns. A Defense Department spokesperson stated that such upgrades are routine during administration changes and that Hegseth is doing his own makeup for TV appearances. The suggestion for the improved space came from a former Fox News producer, with approval from other officials, and will be available to senior leaders. Hegseth has been using the press room for television appearances, including one where he blamed the media for revealing his sharing of sensitive military strike details in a Signal group chat.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece introduces the concept of a "Waymo Democrat," advocating for advanced manufacturing and technological innovation as a political platform.

          <p>Following a deadly attack on tourists in Kashmir, India has announced it is downgrading diplomatic ties with Pakistan and suspending a crucial water treaty. The Indus Waters Treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, governs water usage from six rivers flowing through both countries. India's foreign secretary stated the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan credibly ends its support for cross-border terrorism. The move comes after Pakistan's Defense Minister denied Pakistani involvement in the attack, blaming India's internal policies.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is heading towards $95,000, rising for a third consecutive day amid a broad market relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Exchange-traded funds tracking bitcoin saw a spike in inflows, with investors viewing the cryptocurrency as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and dollar volatility. The rally has forced short sellers to cover their positions, further pushing the price higher. Analysts suggest the next resistance level is around $95,000, with $100,000 remaining a key psychological level.</p>
