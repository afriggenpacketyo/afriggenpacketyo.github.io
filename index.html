          <p>A federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from withholding funds from "sanctuary cities." This decision follows a lawsuit filed by San Francisco and other local governments challenging the administration's efforts to limit cooperation with federal immigration agents. The judge found that the threat to withhold funding would cause irreparable harm, including budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust between cities and their communities, and reiterates a previous lawsuit victory against the first Trump administration.</p>
