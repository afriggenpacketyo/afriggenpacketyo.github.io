          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) declared it would lay down its arms after a four-decade-long insurgency against the Turkish state, a decision that could significantly impact regional dynamics. The announcement followed calls from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan for the group to disarm, as the PKK now believes the Kurdish issue can be solved through democratic politics. The group's decision could end a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and influence other Kurdish militias, particularly in Syria, potentially shifting regional dynamics beyond Turkey's borders. The Turkish government has publicly stated that no concessions were made to persuade the PKK to disarm.</p>

          <p>Britain's armed forces are facing significant challenges, including dwindling troop numbers, weak morale, and outdated equipment, amidst growing geopolitical instability, particularly the threat from Russia. A Strategic Defence Review is underway to identify threats and recommend solutions, but doubts remain about its potential impact. The British Army, struggling to meet its target of 73,000 soldiers, could be expended within months in a conflict similar to the Ukraine war, according to a defence minister. The article also points to weaknesses in Britain's NATO commitments, including shortages of ammunition and ground-based air defenses, and highlights the challenges of sustaining prolonged military campaigns.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has announced plans to disband its organizational structure and end its armed struggle against the Turkish government, marking a potential turning point after four decades of conflict. The group stated that it has brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics, completing its historical mission. This announcement follows a call by PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan to lay down arms and comes as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted at the decision, expressing optimism for a terror-free Turkey. The PKK was founded in 1978 with the goal of achieving an independent Kurdish state, later seeking autonomy within Turkey.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid, aiming to fund $4.5 trillion in tax breaks as part of President Trump's legislative agenda. The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Republicans claim will eliminate waste and abuse. Democrats warn that these cuts will result in millions of Americans losing healthcare coverage and amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposals would reduce the number of people with healthcare by 8.6 million over the next decade, leading to a significant political battle over healthcare policy.</p>

          <p>A widespread power outage affecting Spain, Portugal, and southern France has sparked a debate about the role of renewable energy sources in maintaining energy security. The blackout, which lasted several hours, disrupted daily life and prompted investigations into its cause, including the possibility of a cyberattack. While some observers have suggested that the high reliance on wind and solar power in Spain and Portugal may have contributed to the outage, Spanish authorities and grid operators maintain that renewable energy was not at fault. The incident has highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources and ensuring grid stability as countries transition to cleaner energy systems.</p>

Bloom Money aims to provide a regulated and digital solution to this informal but reliable system, helping immigrant communities build wealth and overcome financial barriers. The app helps prevent scenarios of fraud, and is meant to formalize practices that might be misconstrued by mainstream banks.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cited "substantial progress," while China's He Lifeng mentioned an "important consensus" and a new "consultation mechanism." The negotiations aimed to ease tensions following President Trump's heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, which have disrupted trade and impacted the global economy. Financial markets reacted positively to the news, but uncertainty remains until the joint statement is released.</p>

          <p>President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil is visiting Beijing, where China’s Xi Jinping will meet officials from Latin American and Caribbean nations to emphasize their ties. The move is seen as a response to President Trump's efforts to draw Latin American countries closer to Washington, echoing the Monroe Doctrine. Lula views China as a partner in rebalancing global power and a geopolitical counterweight to US hegemony. China's growing trade and investment in Latin America have made it a key economic partner, though some countries are wary of Chinese exporters flooding their markets with cheap goods.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a plan to cut Medicaid, which would cause millions of poor Americans to lose health coverage and millions more to pay higher fees. The proposal omits some of the deepest cuts but would still significantly reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion over a decade. The legislation includes a work requirement for childless adults and increases paperwork requirements. Democrats have assailed the package as an attack on health coverage for vulnerable populations, while Republicans claim it is necessary to control costs and ensure program integrity.</p>

          <p>House Republicans unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump's “ big, beautiful bill ” late Sunday, at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. Tallying hundreds of pages, the legislation is touching off the biggest political fight over health care since Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, during Trump's first term in 2017 — which ended in failure. The preliminary CBO analysis said the committee's proposals would reduce the deficit by $912 billion over the decade — with at least $715 billion coming from the health provisions.</p>
