          <p>Denver Fire Station 3, the city's oldest serving firehouse, is recognized for its significant role as the first station to house Black firefighters. Until the desegregation of the Denver Fire Department in 1957, it was the only station where Black firefighters were assigned. The article highlights the pride and commitment to excellence exhibited by these early public servants, who overcame racial hurdles to serve the Five Points community. The article also mentions Fire Chief Rod Juniel, who had to go to court to be admitted to the Denver Fire Department in the 1970s.</p>

          <p>Australians are heading to the polls to elect a new government amidst economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, as well as complex international relations. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living issues, though both major parties have only offered small-scale solutions. The article notes a shift away from major parties toward independent candidates, reflecting dissatisfaction with the current political landscape. The opposition leader has adopted some policies similar to President Trump's, including denouncing "wokeness", but this strategy has become less effective as the Trump presidency has unfolded.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie as unconstitutional, marking the first permanent block of such an order. Judge Beryl Howell deemed the order an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The order had imposed punitive measures on Perkins Coie, including suspending security clearances and barring access to government buildings. The judge criticized the order for penalizing the firm based on its representation of clients with positions adverse to Trump.</p>

The definition of autism has broadened over time, including conditions like Asperger's syndrome.

While some worry about the glamorization of autism, others emphasize the importance of support for those who spent much of their lives undiagnosed.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require placebo-controlled trials for new vaccines, a policy shift described as "radical." The policy's definition of "new" remains unclear, raising questions about its application to updated flu and COVID vaccines. Kennedy has long questioned vaccine safety, advocating for placebo trials to ensure they do not cause more harm than good. Experts have noted the ethical concerns of using placebos when safe and effective vaccines already exist, but the HHS maintains it will follow the "Gold Standard of Science".</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made substantial gains in English local elections, positioning itself as a significant challenger to Britain's main political parties. The party secured control of several councils from the Conservatives and won a by-election, increasing scrutiny of its performance in office. Farage has ruled out formal coalitions but remains open to informal cooperation with other parties. The results have prompted responses from major party leaders, acknowledging voter frustration and the need for change.</p>

The rapid rise of Reform UK, along with gains by the Liberal Democrats and Green Party, raises questions about the future political landscape. The focus now shifts to how the major parties will respond and how Reform UK will adjust to the realities of power.</p>

          <p>During the Pacific Palisades fire, water supplies ran low, partly due to the Santa Ynez Reservoir being offline for repairs. Emails reveal that Los Angeles water managers had considered reviving an old reservoir as an alternative, but the plan was never completed. The inability to bring either reservoir online undermined the potential water supply in the area, as firefighters reported hydrants running dry. The city ultimately determined that bringing the Pacific Palisades Reservoir back online could have posed a risk to workers and residents of nearby homes because of structural and other safety issues.</p>

          <p>Germany has defended its decision to classify the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, following criticism from the White House. The intelligence agency that made the classification found AfD's "prevailing understanding of people based on ethnicity and descent" goes against Germany's "free democratic order". The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote. The new classification gives authorities greater powers to monitor the AfD using tactics like phone interception and undercover agents.</p>

He is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the equipment outages caused by outdated technology and called for an all-new air traffic control system.</p>
