          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a public health alert for specific Hello Fresh ready-made meals containing spinach potentially contaminated with listeria. The affected products, Cheesy Pulled Pork Pepper Pasta and Unstuffed Peppers with Ground Turkey, were produced by FreshRealm, a company linked to a broader listeria outbreak. While no illnesses have been confirmed from these specific meals, the spinach used tested positive for the bacteria. Listeria infection can cause serious illness, particularly for vulnerable populations, and is responsible for approximately 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths annually in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Sungrow Power Supply, the world's largest manufacturer of solar inverters and energy storage systems, has filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The move comes as the Hefei-based company aims to capitalize on the city's booming stock market, despite facing new U.S. import tariffs on Chinese-made solar products. With a 25.2% global market share in inverters and a leading position in energy storage, Sungrow's listing seeks to further solidify its dominance in the renewable energy sector. The company has maintained its top position in global inverter shipments for ten consecutive years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that China is decisively leading the global transition to green energy, with its renewable installations far outpacing those in the United States. The author highlights that China's solar additions in 2024 were more than six times greater than those in the U.S., even as the American clean energy sector faces uncertainty under the Trump administration. The piece criticizes the U.S. for its continued reliance on fossil fuels and for having higher per capita carbon emissions than China. It concludes that the U.S. is acting like a petrostate, hindering global progress on climate change.</p>

          <p>Cameroon's upcoming presidential election is marked by widespread disillusionment among the nation's youth, who constitute over half the population. The disqualification of popular opposition figure Maurice Kamto has led many young people to question the election's legitimacy, where 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya is expected to win an eighth term. While some youth leaders report an increase in voter registration, many others express frustration over chronic unemployment, corruption, and a sense that the political system is closed. This apathy could significantly impact turnout, despite the potential for the youth vote to be a decisive factor.</p>

          <p>Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick is defending remarks in which he described the Handsworth area of Birmingham as "one of the worst-integrated places" he had ever visited. In a leaked recording, Jenrick stated he had not seen "another white face" during a visit, comments that have drawn sharp criticism from Labour and Handsworth's MP for being irresponsible and divisive. Jenrick stood by his comments, asserting the need for a frank conversation about "parallel communities" to foster a united country. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch suggested Jenrick was "making an observation" but emphasized that the true measure of integration is when appearance is irrelevant.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 18 suspects and dismantled a major international criminal gang believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China annually. The investigation, triggered by a single victim tracking their stolen iPhone to a warehouse, uncovered a network that may handle nearly half of all phones stolen in London. The operation has revealed that street thieves were paid up to £300 per handset, which could then be sold for as much as £4,000 in China. This crackdown represents the UK's largest-ever operation against phone theft amid rising incidents nationwide.</p>

Experts note an "almost complete dehumanization" on both sides, which presents a significant barrier to any peace process.

This is the third failed attempt by President Emmanuel Macron to establish a minority government since his party lost its parliamentary majority, leading to persistent political deadlock. Macron now faces difficult choices: appoint a sixth prime minister in under two years, potentially from an opposition party, or dissolve parliament and call for new elections.

          <p>The recent resignation of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu marks a new and distinct phase in France's ongoing political crisis. Unlike previous government collapses caused by opposition no-confidence votes, this one was triggered by the withdrawal of support from a key ally, the center-right Les Republicains party. This move suggests that as the 2027 presidential election approaches, political parties are beginning to distance themselves from the unpopular President Macron to position themselves for the future.

          <p>Cardiff University is defending its decision to open its first overseas campus in Astana, Kazakhstan, after a faculty union raised concerns about the country's human rights record and the project's rapid implementation. University officials state that the new campus is part of a strategy to boost international education and revenue amid financial pressures at home, and that proper due diligence was conducted. The University and College Union expressed worries about risks to the university's reputation and the welfare of staff and students, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals. The vice chancellor argued the presence would help share Welsh values and educate a future generation of leaders.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced on state television that his government has foiled a plot by a "local terrorist group" to plant an explosive device at the U.S. embassy in Caracas. Maduro described the alleged plan as a "false flag" operation designed to escalate conflict between the two nations, which severed diplomatic ties in 2019. Officials stated they had warned Washington of the threat and reinforced security around the diplomatic mission, which is staffed by only a few local employees. The claim comes amid heightened tensions, with the U.S. conducting military strikes on Venezuelan vessels suspected of drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens are once again present in Exmoor National Park following a successful reintroduction effort by conservationists. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project released 19 of the mammals, sourced from Scottish populations, at undisclosed locations within the park. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar to allow researchers to monitor their progress and adaptation to the new environment. Conservationists hailed the return as a "positive sign for nature," emphasizing that re-establishing this native species, which is a critical part of the woodland ecosystem, demonstrates that nature can be restored.</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7 attack, Germany is navigating a complex landscape of firm government support for Israel and changing public opinion. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government maintains its commitment to Israel's security, it has also criticized Israeli military actions in Gaza and suspended some arms deliveries. Domestically, the country has seen a significant rise in antisemitic incidents, with pro-Palestinian protests becoming a regular occurrence. Jewish leaders in Germany report feeling demonized for the actions of the Israeli government, highlighting the challenge of balancing political criticism with combating a resurgence of antisemitism from both the far-right and far-left.</p>

          <p>Clearsprings Ready Homes, a private company contracted by the UK Home Office to accommodate asylum seekers, has made nearly £187 million in profits since 2019. This comes despite numerous allegations from residents and charities of poor conditions at its subcontracted hotels, including inedible food and the rationing of basic supplies like toilet paper. The value of the company's 10-year government contract has more than tripled to a projected £7 billion due to the increased use of hotels for housing. Critics and MPs have called the profits "obscene" and argue the system incentivizes placing people in more profitable, but often inadequate, temporary hotel accommodations.</p>

          <p>Dr. Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, has stated that David Norris, one of his son's killers, must identify the other individuals involved in the 1993 racist attack to be considered safe for release. Norris, who is facing a public Parole Board hearing, recently admitted his involvement in the murder for the first time after decades of denial. Dr. Lawrence insists that for Norris to demonstrate genuine change, he must provide the names of the other attackers who were never brought to justice. He also wants to know if Norris still holds racist views, which would make him a continued danger to the public.</p>

          <p>The Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's, which closed its U.S. locations two decades ago, has made its return with a new restaurant in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The reopening was met with significant enthusiasm, as reservations for its first day were fully booked and devoted fans traveled from as far as Ohio to be among the first customers. The original Minnesota-born chain, founded in 1975, grew to over 200 locations before bankruptcy and a hepatitis A outbreak led to its demise in 2004. The revival was made possible through an agreement between the founder's son and Hormel Foods, which owns the Chi-Chi's trademark.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration's plan to deploy the National Guard to the city, calling the move an "unconstitutional invasion." Despite the legal challenge, a judge declined to issue an immediate restraining order, and it was revealed in court that troops from Texas are already on their way. State officials argue the deployment is an unlawful use of military force for civilian law enforcement and a political maneuver against leadership that has fallen out of the president's favor. The lawsuit cites the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement.</p>

U.S. Border Patrol recorded approximately 238,000 apprehensions, a dramatic decrease from the record 2.2 million recorded in 2022 under the Biden administration. The sharp decline is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, which include sealing the border, ending the asylum system via emergency powers, and ramping up deportations. While the administration credits its policies for enhancing national security, critics and civil liberties groups have denounced the measures as inhumane and illegal.</p>
