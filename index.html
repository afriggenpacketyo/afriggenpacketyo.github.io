          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party," claiming it will give Americans their freedom back. Writing on his social media platform X, Musk suggested the party could focus on a small number of key congressional seats to act as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. The announcement follows a public falling out between Musk and former President Donald Trump, primarily over opposition to a major spending bill. The party does not yet appear to be registered with the Federal Election Committee.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck after responding to a call about a suspicious person outside an ICE detention facility on the Fourth of July. The officer was treated at a hospital and has since been released. Authorities report that several armed suspects, some wearing body armor, were taken into custody after they allegedly vandalized property and used fireworks to lure law enforcement into an ambush. The Justice Department is monitoring the situation, calling it an attack on a federal facility.</p>

          <p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has traveled to Damascus for a meeting with Syria's new interim government, which came to power after ousting the Assad regime. Lammy stated his purpose was to urge the new leaders to govern with inclusivity, transparency, and accountability. The visit comes as Western nations reset relations with Syria but also express deep concern over recent violent attacks on minority groups. There are growing fears within Syria that the new Islamic-led government is restricting social freedoms and becoming a new form of dictatorship.</p>

          <p>Officials have declared a "mass casualty event" in central Texas after catastrophic flash floods resulted in at least 32 deaths, including 14 children. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, inundating the area and leaving more than two dozen people missing, many from a children's summer camp. Hundreds of people have been rescued, some found clinging to trees, as emergency crews continue extensive search operations by air and on the ground. The scale of the disaster has overwhelmed local communities, with the governor signing a federal disaster declaration to provide state resources.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire, burning in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, has grown to become California's largest wildfire of the year, consuming nearly 80,000 acres. Fueled by high heat and winds, the fire is approximately 10% contained and has forced over 200 people to evacuate. The blaze threatens about 50 structures and the Carrizo Plain National Monument, which is a habitat for several endangered species. A looming heatwave is expected to exacerbate fire conditions across Southern California.</p>

          <p>Following a severe heatwave, more than 1,000 emergency personnel are fighting two large wildfires in the eastern German states of Saxony and Thuringia. The fires have burned through an estimated 1,000 hectares (2,470 acres) of forest.

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing widespread criticism after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" to describe some bankers during a rally in Iowa. Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, condemned the remark as irresponsible and evocative of centuries-old tropes about Jewish people and greed. When questioned about his use of the term, the president claimed he was unaware of its offensive connotations. The incident has renewed debate over the president's rhetoric and its impact on normalizing harmful stereotypes.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the U.S. tax system reveals significant disparities in how the ultra-wealthy and the middle class are taxed, stemming not from tax rates but from the type of income. Billionaires often pay a lower effective tax rate because their wealth grows through investments, which are taxed differently and at lower rates than wages. The article explains how strategies like "buy-borrow-die" allow the wealthy to live off tax-free loans against their assets and pass on wealth with minimal tax consequences.

          <p>The arrest of boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. in Los Angeles has created a sense of unease in his hometown of Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, Mexico. U.S. authorities arrested him for overstaying his visa and noted an active Mexican warrant for alleged trafficking and ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. In Culiacan, where his father is a revered icon, talk of the cartel has become taboo following a recent, bloody internal feud. The news has cast a shadow over the family's legacy and highlighted the region's ongoing security issues.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is under fire for sending an email that critics are calling "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The email praised President Trump's new spending bill, claiming it "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." In reality, the bill does not eliminate the tax but provides a temporary, income-capped deduction. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the communication as a partisan and unconscionable misuse of a previously apolitical government agency.</p>

          <p>A focus group of voters who supported the Labour party in 2024 has revealed a strong sense of disappointment with the government's first year in power. Participants from Kent, who were key to Labour's victory, expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, such as immigration. Many felt the government had been dishonest and were worried by recent policy U-turns, with some now considering voting for the rival Reform UK party in a future election, reflecting a significant souring of the public mood.</p>
