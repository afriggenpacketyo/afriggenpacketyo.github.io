          <p>S&P Global Ratings has significantly revised its forecast for China's real estate market, now expecting new home sales to plummet by 8% in 2025, a steeper decline than previously projected. This extends the industry slump into a fifth consecutive year, primarily due to persistently fragile homebuyer sentiment and less aggressive policy easing from Beijing. The market has nearly halved in value since 2021, and further declines are anticipated in 2026, challenging hopes for a swift recovery. Authorities are working to stabilize demand, especially in higher-tier cities, but the overall market remains weaker than expected.</p>

          <p>Hargreaves Lansdowne, the largest retail investment platform in the UK, has issued a stark warning to investors, asserting that Bitcoin does not qualify as an asset class and should not be included in portfolios for growth or income. This advisory comes after the UK lifted a ban on retail investors accessing crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which offer exposure to digital tokens. The platform emphasizes that cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic value and reliable performance assumptions, making them unsuitable for long-term financial objectives. While some financial experts and institutions see digital assets as a hedge against volatility, Hargreaves Lansdowne maintains a cautious stance on their inclusion in investment strategies, despite the increasing mainstream interest in Bitcoin.

          <p>Ferrari's stock experienced its worst trading day ever after the luxury carmaker updated its 2025 and 2030 guidance, which fell short of analyst expectations. The company projected net revenue of at least 7.1 billion euros for the current year and around 9 billion euros by 2030, with EBITDA targets also set. Furthermore, Ferrari scaled back its electrification ambitions, now aiming for a 2030 lineup of 40% internal combustion engine, 40% hybrid, and only 20% fully electric vehicles, down from a previous 40% EV target. This strategic pivot, attributed to a client-centric approach and evolving market conditions, led to a significant drop in share price despite plans for new model launches and strong demand.

          <p>The American trucking industry is grappling with an alarming surge in online cargo theft, experiencing a 1,500% increase over the past four years, with daily losses estimated at $19 million. These sophisticated, tech-driven crimes are often perpetrated by transnational organizations, primarily from Eastern Europe, targeting high-value freight. The lack of a dedicated federal law enforcement agency and mandatory reporting mechanisms exacerbates the problem, leading to significant financial strain and increased insurance premiums for businesses. Industry leaders are urgently calling on lawmakers to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA) to establish a unified federal task force and a national database, aiming to provide a more effective response to these escalating criminal activities.</p>

This move comes amid escalating public discontent, further fueled by a recent concert shooting in Lima that injured several people. Boluarte, who ascended to the presidency in December 2022, has drawn criticism for attributing the crime wave, including a significant rise in homicides and extortion, to illegal immigration. The legislative action sets the stage for a debate and trial, potentially leading to her removal from office, reflecting the deep political and social instability gripping the nation.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has robustly defended his generation of players against recent criticism from Steven Gerrard, who characterized them as "egotistical losers" lacking team cohesion. On his BBC podcast, Rooney countered that his squad worked diligently and genuinely attempted to achieve success, but ultimately "didn't quite manage to get over the line" in major tournaments. He acknowledged that relationships between players from rival clubs, like Liverpool and Manchester United, were more challenging then compared to today's era, which he attributes to improved media coverage and off-field camaraderie. Rooney emphasized that despite their lack of silverware, the team was always united in their effort and belief.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, has declared his party ready to replace Welsh Labour in the upcoming Senedd election, promising a "new government, with new energy and new ideas." Labour has governed Wales since devolution began in 1999, but recent polling suggests Plaid Cymru is now vying for leadership, alongside Reform UK. Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid as the leading anti-Reform party and a credible alternative government, even though forming a majority might require coalition. The party plans to offer "radical" yet financially cautious policies, like a payment to tackle child poverty, appealing to a broader electorate beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking strongholds.</p>

Such findings challenge the perceived effectiveness of US export controls, which aim to restrict advanced technology sales to Chinese customers and have placed Huawei on a trade blacklist since 2019.

This innovative research found that salt-doped ice produces an electrical response comparable to some of the best ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. The underlying mechanism is flexoelectricity, which involves the generation of an electrical charge when a material experiences non-uniform strain. This discovery builds upon earlier work by the same team on pure ice and holds promise for developing low-cost energy sources, particularly in regions where ice is plentiful.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have announced new joint policies to tackle "disorderly price competition" prevalent in several industries. This concerted effort aims to mitigate the negative impacts of price wars and aggressive cost-cutting, which harm industry development, product innovation, and overall quality and safety. The regulatory bodies will collaborate with industry associations to assess average production costs and help businesses establish fair pricing. Authorities are now empowered to issue warnings, conduct thorough cost investigations, and intervene directly when price wars are suspected, ensuring compliance with pricing laws and fostering a more stable and healthy national economy.</p>

          <p>A principal software engineer at Microsoft, Scott Sutfin-Glowski, has resigned after 13 years, citing the company's continued provision of cloud services to the Israeli military and executives' reluctance to discuss the war in Gaza. In his resignation letter, Sutfin-Glowski stated he could "no longer accept enabling what may be the worst atrocities of our time," referencing reports of numerous Microsoft subscriptions used by the Israeli military. This departure follows months of internal employee protests and previous actions by Microsoft to cease certain services to a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The incident highlights ongoing ethical tensions within tech companies regarding their involvement in international conflicts.</p>

          <p>China's chip and AI-related stocks have seen a remarkable rally in recent months, largely propelled by the nation's strategic drive for technological self-sufficiency, yet their rapidly soaring valuations are now challenging investor confidence. A leading index for Chinese semiconductor shares has climbed 55% since late June, significantly outperforming global chip markets. This surge is underpinned by strong governmental backing for domestic tech firms and directives to reduce reliance on foreign processors like Nvidia's. However, fund managers are cautioning that these elevated multiples offer minimal room for error, implying that market patience will quickly diminish if companies fail to meet the high performance expectations now embedded in their stock prices.

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has issued a stern warning, threatening to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick during the prolonged government shutdown, referring to them as "problem children." Duffy asserts that these absent employees are causing over half of the nation's flight delays, even though they are classified as essential workers and required to perform their duties without immediate pay. He commended the majority of controllers who continue to work, claiming only a small fraction are "lashing out" through absenteeism. The Secretary emphasized that only employees who report for work will receive retroactive pay once the government reopens, adding pressure to federal workers affected by the legislative impasse.</p>

This incident follows death threats and a petition for his removal from the university after the assassination of a conservative activist, leading him to relocate to Europe for safety.
