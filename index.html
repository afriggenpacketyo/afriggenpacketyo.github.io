          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals a record low approval rating of 27.4% for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, marking a 5.2 percentage point drop from the previous month. Dissatisfaction has grown due to Ishiba's reluctance to implement consumption tax cuts to combat rising prices, especially soaring rice costs, with 87.1% of respondents feeling the government's efforts are insufficient. The survey also indicates that 73.2% believe consumption taxes should be reduced or abolished to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis, while 72.9% expressed concern about potential declines in social security services.

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes India's strategic challenges in resolving its long-standing conflict with Pakistan, highlighting how recent military clashes, though resulting in a battlefield draw, have been a setback for India's aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power. The article emphasizes that the ongoing friction with Pakistan, partly fueled by religious nationalism on both sides, distracts India from focusing on its broader regional and global objectives, particularly its competition with China. Despite India's military strikes against Pakistan in response to terrorist attacks, a former national security advisor notes that outright military victory is nearly impossible given the threat from both countriesâ€™ nuclear arsenals. The piece suggests that India must find a modus vivendi with Pakistan to move forward as a global power.</p>

          <p>A UK government minister confirms efforts to secure a deal with the EU that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues. Negotiations are ongoing ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, with the government focused on jobs, lower household bills, and stronger borders. However, some Conservative MPs express concerns that the deal could lead to the UK becoming a "rule taker" by aligning with EU standards post-Brexit, potentially compromising British sovereignty.</p>

          <p>With the end of the half-decade pause on federal student loan collections, the Trump administration is set to resume wage garnishment, federal tax refund seizures, and Social Security benefit offsets for defaulted borrowers. This action affects over 5 million borrowers currently in default, with the potential to reach 10 million, causing significant financial strain amid high living costs. The Education Department can garnish up to 15% of disposable income and federal benefits, leading to difficult choices between vital expenses for many, especially retirees and those with existing financial hardships.

          <p>Two volumes of the 2,300-year-old Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, considered the earliest known in China, have been returned to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art, part of the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. These manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period around 300BC, are historically significant and predate the Dead Sea Scrolls. The repatriation follows diplomatic efforts by China's National Cultural Heritage Administration, enabled by the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy. The manuscripts were illegally excavated in 1942 and acquired by an American collector in 1946 before being gifted to the museum in 1992.</p>

The FIA's statement indicates that the red flag was set at 16:32:17.6, while Bearman crossed the line at 16:32:20.9, therefore the lap was disallowed.</p>

The article argues that Biden's insistence on running for a second term, despite his promise to be a one-term "bridge," ultimately paved the way for the current president. While acknowledging Biden's faults, the author expresses a preference for an impaired Biden over the current occupant of the Oval Office. The book highlights a systematic effort by family and advisors to conceal Biden's declining condition and calls out Democratic leaders who failed to challenge him.</p>

          <p>Despite a decline in Southern California Edison's safety record, including an increase in fires sparked by its equipment and serious employee injuries, some top executives received increased cash bonuses. While the company reduced executive bonuses awarded for the 2024 year due to the safety failures, the bonuses for four of the top five executives actually rose because of performance on other responsibilities. Consumer advocates criticize this outcome, arguing that it highlights a flaw in the state law designed to tie executive compensation to safety performance. The Utility Reform Network suggests that the potential for lucrative stock bonuses overshadows the impact of safety-related deductions.</p>

          <p>Faced with the Trump administration's attempts to roll back environmental regulations, California is mounting a multi-pronged defense through litigation and legislation. The state has filed numerous lawsuits challenging federal actions, including those targeting California's clean air standards and cap-and-trade program. Additionally, California lawmakers are pursuing legislation to strengthen state-level environmental protections, such as requiring corporations to disclose carbon emissions and making polluters pay for climate damages. While the outcome of these battles remains uncertain, California is determined to safeguard its climate progress and continue leading the way on environmental policy.</p>

Malcolm X advocated for self-confidence and fighting for rights "by any means necessary," including violence if needed, in response to the oppression of Black people. After joining the Nation of Islam, he denounced "white devils" but later changed his views after a pilgrimage to Mecca, advocating for an alliance of all oppressed people of color.
