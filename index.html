          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a £2 billion upgrade project that began in 2002. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce travel times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while also planting 285,000 trees to offset environmental impact. Despite criticism over the project's cost and duration, supporters believe it will significantly benefit communities by generating jobs and improving connectivity.</p>

          <p>Democratic governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland urged the Democratic party to adopt a more forceful approach, emphasizing the importance of building coalitions and engaging with various constituencies. Both governors dismissed any intentions of seeking the presidential nomination in 2028, focusing instead on the immediate political landscape. Moore stressed the need to deliver an alternative to Trump's policies, while Walz encouraged Democrats to compete in every district and school board seat. Their remarks were made at Rep.

          <p>A sperm donor in Europe, who has been used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, was found to carry a rare cancer-causing mutation linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 children. The mutation, in the TP53 gene, causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, significantly increasing the risk of developing cancer. The European Sperm Bank confirmed the variant's presence in some of the donor’s sperm, noting it was not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008 and undetectable through standard screening. The bank is now advocating for an internationally binding family limit and emphasizes that donor-assisted reproduction remains a safer alternative to natural conception due to genetic screening.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the UN's population estimates may significantly undercount the number of people living in rural areas, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions. This discrepancy arises because census data in the global south is often incomplete or unreliable outside major cities. The article discusses historical anxieties about overpopulation and the measures taken to control population growth, particularly in developing countries. While concerns about climate change and resource depletion persist, the focus has shifted to women's empowerment and education as effective strategies for reducing fertility rates.</p>

What started as a one-day event in a park has evolved into a three-day weekend trip, with participants traveling from across the country. Some friends act as producers, while two new players each year take on the role of "Jeff Probst" to plan the challenges and twists. The weekend is described as anxiety-inducing but also the highlight of the year, fostering camaraderie and shared experiences among friends.</p>

          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of privacy and integrity risk assessments for new features on platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, reducing human oversight. This shift aims to accelerate product development but raises concerns about AI's ability to adequately address complex issues related to privacy, youth risk, and content integrity. Former Meta employees fear that this automation could lead to unforeseen repercussions and the potential misuse of Meta's apps. Meta maintains that human expertise will still be used for novel and complex issues and that the automated system's decisions are being audited.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are raising concerns about the validity of deals made between the Trump administration and several large law firms, suggesting they may be the result of coercion. These deals involve the firms agreeing to provide pro bono services in exchange for maintaining access to federal buildings and curtailing investigations into their hiring practices. Some legal scholars argue that these agreements lack a genuine meeting of the minds and may violate federal bribery statutes. Meanwhile, law firms challenging Trump's actions in court have been successful, further undermining the legitimacy of the deals.</p>

A German court ruling stating that migrants face no extreme hardships in Greece has paved the way for potential deportations, which Greece is resisting.</p>
