          <p>President Trump declared that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, involving the release of all hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line. This announcement follows intense negotiations and marks a potential turning point in the two-year conflict. Trump emphasized fair treatment for all parties involved and teased a possible visit to Israel to solidify the agreement. The preliminary agreement has been confirmed by Israeli officials, Hamas, and mediator Qatar, with details expected to be announced soon, pending finalization of specific terms and mechanisms. This development could lead to a more comprehensive resolution of the conflict's underlying issues, including Hamas disarmament and Palestinian self-governance. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>China has tightened export rules on rare earths, critical elements in high-tech manufacturing, citing national security concerns. The new regulations formalize existing rules on processing technology and overseas cooperation, potentially impacting foreign arms manufacturers and semiconductor firms. This move comes amid ongoing trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, with rare earth exports being a key point of contention. The restrictions include mining, smelting, magnetic material manufacturing, and recycling, potentially affecting the US, which lacks processing facilities despite having a significant rare earths mining industry.

Ventura County Line Train 104, carrying 85 passengers, struck an empty Metrolink train at the platform.

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party has experienced a significant decline in membership, nearly halving in the last five years, despite recent electoral success. Membership has fallen from almost 118,000 in 2020 to 60,000. This decline is masked by the inclusion of "registered supporters" in published figures. The Green Party of England and Wales, in contrast, has seen a 91% increase in membership since 2020. A party spokesperson highlighted that more people are backing the Liberal Democrats in actual elections. The optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>Former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz claimed that members of Congress had to wear QR codes at an AIPAC reception, allowing donors to scan them for donations. Gaetz described the experience as "demoralizing," likening it to being scanned like a can of tomato soup. He also raised concerns about his experiences in Israel, including an incident where someone was "rooting around" in his hotel room. AIPAC denied Gaetz's claim, stating that barcodes are for security reasons, not fundraising. The optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's obsession with his obituaries and his conviction on 34 felony counts is driving a dramatic escalation of his revenge crusade. The president has demanded the jailing of elected officials from the opposing political party without evidence of crimes. Former FBI Director James Comey was arraigned on charges of making false statements to Congress. Trump's threats are no longer bluster, as the federal government takes legal action against those he wants punished. The normal barriers between the White House and the Department of Justice have been obliterated. The optimism score is 15.</p>

The Pentagon is also planning to move news organizations from their dedicated workspaces, isolating reporters. The Pentagon maintains that it has engaged in good-faith negotiations.

          <p>Ongoing protests in Portland have created a perception of the city as unsafe, impacting local businesses. President Trump's announcement of deploying the National Guard to quell opposition to ICE activity has exacerbated these concerns. Business owners have submitted legal declarations, saying the president's rhetoric has been damaging. The court blocked the federalization and deployment of Oregon National Guard troops, but the appellate court temporarily granted a White House request that the 200 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control while the case plays out.
