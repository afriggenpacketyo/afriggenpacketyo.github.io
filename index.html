          <p>Chinese officials are promoting a recently enacted law designed to support the private economy, viewing it as a crucial element for growth as the nation focuses inward for economic momentum. This move comes amidst ongoing trade disputes with the United States. According to officials, the new law aims to address challenges faced by private enterprises, such as ensuring fair market competition, equal access, financial support, and legal protections.
