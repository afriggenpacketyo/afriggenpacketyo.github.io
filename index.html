          <h2>US and China Disagree on Status of Trade Talks Amidst Tariff War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China are embroiled in a trade dispute, with conflicting reports on whether active trade talks are even occurring. President Trump claimed that the two countries are actively engaged in discussions, while a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson dismissed this as "fake news." The disagreement comes after Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting retaliatory measures from China. Experts suggest that China perceives itself as having the upper hand in the standoff, as Trump has hinted at potential tariff reductions amid market volatility and recession fears.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order directing the U.S. government to advance seabed mining in international waters, a move that is opposed by most other nations. The order instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. territorial waters. This decision circumvents a decades-old treaty ratified by nearly all major coastal nations except the United States and reflects the Trump administration's disregard for international institutions.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a negotiated settlement to the war between Russia and Ukraine. This would reverse over a decade of U.S. policy and contradict the 2018 Crimea Declaration, in which the U.S. pledged to maintain its non-recognition policy until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. During his first term, Trump had hinted at potentially accepting Russia's annexation of the peninsula, but his administration later doubled down against Moscow. The potential shift signals a willingness to compromise on long-standing principles in pursuit of a peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Warnings of retail shortages are increasing as the U.S.-China trade war disrupts supply chains, with apparel, footwear, and low-margin goods expected to be the first affected. High tariffs on Chinese imports, which account for a significant portion of U.S. apparel and footwear, are operating as import bans. Declining Chinese freight vessel bookings and canceled sailings are further exacerbating the situation. Supply chain experts say that lower-end stores will be hit hard by tariffs on low-cost imports and if they run lean on inventory, that will be seen much faster.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's online store is selling merchandise emblazoned with "Trump 2028," the year of the next U.S. presidential election, despite the constitutional ban on him running for a third term. The 78-year-old has not ruled out serving a third term, though most spectators consider that highly unlikely. The 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states that "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice." Trump has insisted he is "not joking" about a third term, saying there are "methods" that would allow it to happen.</p>

Carney emphasized that this would never happen, reiterating his stance to Trump directly. Trump's trade policies and suggestions about incorporating Canada into the U.S. have become key issues in the Canadian election. Despite Trump's claim of neutrality, his past remarks and tariff actions have fueled patriotic sentiment in Canada.</p>

The company's forecast for the current quarter is wider than normal due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.
