          <p>Amid escalating conflict, Israel attacked Iranian state television and warned residents of central Tehran to evacuate, following Iranian missile strikes that reportedly killed civilians in Israel. The Islamic Republic of Iran News Network's broadcast was disrupted by an explosion, with reports of reporter casualties. Iran had launched missiles in retaliation for Israeli attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure, which Tehran claims resulted in numerous deaths. The U.S. is increasing its military presence in the Middle East, and President Trump stated that Iran wants to de-escalate but must reach a nuclear agreement. The fighting has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks, and the U.S. denies involvement in Israel's actions. The gravity of the events is reflected in the warnings and increased military activity.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains in northern West Virginia caused flash floods that killed at least six people, including a child, with rescue crews searching for missing individuals. The severe flooding damaged roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, leaving vehicles submerged and some residents seeking safety in trees. A state of emergency has been declared in Ohio and Marion Counties, with the National Guard assisting in rescue efforts.

          <p>Chelsea's Club World Cup match began with a significant number of empty seats, raising questions about fan interest in the revamped tournament. Some observers attribute the low attendance to factors such as the Monday afternoon kickoff time, high ticket prices, and a lack of marketing by FIFA. While acknowledging the World Cup is coming next year and people are trying to save money for that, some suggest that FIFA should consider realistic ticket pricing for games played in the United States at the World Cup. The empty seats have been described as an embarrassment for FIFA, potentially serving as an early warning regarding ticket pricing and scheduling for future events.</p>

          <p>The state and local tax (SALT) deduction remains a contentious issue as Senate Republicans unveil their tax plan for President Trump's spending package. The SALT deduction cap, set at $10,000 since 2017, has been a key point of contention for lawmakers in high-tax states. While raising the cap is controversial due to benefits primarily flowing to higher-income households, the issue has gained leverage during negotiations amid a slim House Republican majority. Currently, the vast majority of filers utilize the standard deduction and do not benefit from itemized tax breaks.</p>
