          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 100% tariff on all branded and patented pharmaceutical products, effective October 1st, to encourage domestic manufacturing. Companies will be exempt if they are actively building or have started construction on drug manufacturing plants within the United States. This measure is part of a broader tariff strategy, which also includes new duties on heavy trucks and kitchen cabinets, utilizing a Section 232 national security investigation to justify the levies. The pharmaceutical industry has warned these tariffs could disrupt supply chains and increase costs for patients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A critical analysis of the Justice Department's indictment against former FBI Director James Comey suggests it is unusually vague and lacks substantive evidence. The two-page document accuses Comey of lying to Congress but fails to provide specific details or context, a departure from typical federal indictments which are often detailed. This lack of transparency has fueled speculation among legal experts and journalists that the prosecution may be politically motivated by President Trump's public calls to charge his critic. The article raises significant concerns about the potential for authoritarian abuse of the justice system.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements and obstruction during congressional testimony in 2020. The indictment follows public pressure from President Donald Trump for the Justice Department to prosecute Comey, leading to accusations of political interference from critics. Comey has maintained his innocence, stating he is not afraid and expressing confidence in the judicial system, while his attorney confirmed they will fight the charges in court. The prosecutor who brought the charges was recently appointed by Trump after her predecessor reportedly had concerns about the case.</p>

In an interview, he confirmed he would be open to holding national elections during a ceasefire, a significant statement given that elections are currently suspended under martial law. Zelenskyy, whose original five-year term would have ended in May 2024, emphasized that seeking another term is not his personal ambition.

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane over the weekend as it moves northwest. While there are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect, the storm could bring downstream impacts to the southeastern U.S. coast. The National Hurricane Center is tracking its path, noting it is the eighth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters are also monitoring a second weather system in the Caribbean that could develop and potentially bring heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>

          <p>The parents of an 8-year-old girl still missing after a deadly flood at Camp Mystic in Texas have called the camp's decision to reopen "unthinkable." The July 4th flood killed 27 campers and counselors, and the parents argue that reopening while their daughter's body has not been recovered is deeply insensitive. Other families of victims have joined the criticism, stating they were not consulted about a planned memorial and that safety concerns have not been addressed. The camp plans to reopen a sister site in 2026 that was undamaged, stating it is committed to its nearly century-long Christian mission.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has acknowledged that left-wing parties, including his own, have historically shied away from addressing public concerns about illegal immigration. In an op-ed, Starmer stated that Labour must tackle the issue to counter the rise of the "populist Right," specifically noting the challenge from Reform UK. This shift in rhetoric comes as his government prepares to announce a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme to manage immigration more effectively. Starmer's comments aim to reposition the Labour Party on a key electoral issue ahead of its annual conference.</p>

The district attorney criticized state law, which limits the charges to misdemeanors because the assault was over clothing, and is seeking harsher penalties for such offenses.

While federal law already limits ad volume on broadcast and cable TV, it does not cover streaming platforms.

          <p>Around 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home at the New York Aquarium. The coral, which is protected under international conservation agreements, was in poor health after being in transit for five days. Staff at the aquarium acted as a "coral hospital," nursing the animals back to health before moving many of them to public display. The incident highlights the ongoing issue of illegal wildlife trade and the crucial role aquariums can play in conservation and education efforts.</p>

          <p>Pfizer's acquisition of Metsera, a developer of next-generation obesity and metabolic disease drugs, for up to $7.3 billion is expected to intensify research and development in the weight-loss drug sector. Analysts believe the deal signals that major pharmaceutical companies are still willing to make significant investments in innovative treatments in this high-demand market. Metsera's drug candidates aim to offer better efficacy and tolerability with fewer injections than current market leaders. The move is likely to encourage other companies, including those in China, to advance their own innovative obesity drug pipelines to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced that the 20 U.S. Army soldiers who received the Medal of Honor for their actions at the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre will retain their awards. This decision halts a review initiated by his predecessor, which was recommended by Congress amid long-standing efforts by Native American groups and some lawmakers to rescind the medals. The 1890 event resulted in the deaths of an estimated 250 Lakota Sioux men, women, and children. Hegseth's move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to counter what it calls revisionist interpretations of American history.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders in Congress have dismissed a White House memo preparing for mass federal layoffs during a potential government shutdown as an "intimidation" tactic. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated they would not be swayed by the threat from OMB Director Russ Vought. They are holding firm on their demands for concessions on healthcare priorities in exchange for their votes to pass a funding bill.

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs if a government shutdown occurs next week. A memo advised agencies to issue reduction-in-force (RIF) notices to employees in discretionary programs, particularly those not aligned with the President's priorities. This move escalates the stakes in the funding standoff with Congress, as permanent layoffs are far more severe than the temporary furloughs seen in past shutdowns.

          <p>A "very mean squirrel" has been attacking residents in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael, California, sending at least two people to the emergency room with bites and scratches. An 80-year-old woman was among the victims, and a flier posted in the area warns that the squirrel "comes out of nowhere" to attack. The local humane society suggests the squirrel's unusual aggression is likely the result of being hand-fed by humans, which causes wild animals to lose their natural fear and approach people expecting food. Officials advise the public to never feed wildlife to prevent such incidents.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has described the current U.S. economy as being split into two distinct parts: a booming sector driven by the artificial intelligence industry and a struggling consumer-facing segment. He argues that while AI-related tech giants are investing billions and are indifferent to interest rates, foundational sectors like housing, auto sales, and retail are weakening and need rate cuts to recover. Cramer suggests that the strong overall GDP figures are misleading, as they are disproportionately inflated by the AI boom, masking the difficulties faced by a large portion of the economy and its workforce.

Pest control experts and researchers point to several factors, including increased waste from fast food and changes in refuse collection. However, a recent study suggests a strong correlation with rising temperatures, as warmer winters allow rats, who are prolific breeders, to reproduce more successfully year-round. This trend poses public health risks, as rats can transmit diseases, and highlights an unexpected consequence of a warming climate on urban environments.</p>
