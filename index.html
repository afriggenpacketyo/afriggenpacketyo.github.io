          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of increasing urinary symptoms and the discovery of a prostate nodule. While the cancer is aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, offering a viable treatment pathway. Political figures including President Trump and former Vice President Harris have expressed their support and well wishes for Biden's recovery. The article provides context on Biden's previous health issues and general information about prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>Michael Posner, former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, argues that the Trump administration is dismantling the State Department's capacity to promote American values abroad. Proposed cuts to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the elimination of key offices, and narrowing the scope of human rights reports will weaken America's ability to challenge authoritarianism and support democratic movements. Posner highlights the bureau's historical role in ensuring U.S. foreign aid decisions are informed by human rights assessments and its interventions in countries like Myanmar. The article contends that these actions will sideline human rights in U.S. foreign policy and cede global influence to authoritarian powers.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee is reconvening to advance President Trump's domestic policy bill after facing opposition from conservative Republicans who believe it doesn't cut spending enough. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while increasing military and border security spending, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to bringing the legislation to the floor before Memorial Day, despite disagreements over Medicaid work requirements and clean energy subsidies. A group of Republicans from blue states are also threatening to withhold support if the bill doesn't raise the cap on state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>Recent clashes between India and Pakistan have become a testing ground for competing military technologies, particularly Chinese hardware against Western and Russian systems. Pakistan's arsenal, heavily influenced by defense cooperation with China, features advanced air and missile systems, drones, and multirole fighters. The cost differential between Chinese and Western military systems is substantial, potentially reshaping global defense procurement and strategic alignments. The battlefield testing of Chinese weapons systems may signal a strategic paradigm shift in global military dynamics, challenging the long-held dominance of Western military technology.</p>

Murphy referenced claims in the upcoming book “Original Sin” alleging that Biden’s aides covered up the politician’s physical and cognitive decline.

          <p>Israel announced it will permit a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza to prevent a famine, ending a 10-week blockade, while simultaneously expanding its ground operations against Hamas. The decision follows international pressure and warnings about a looming famine. The military has launched strikes on sites, including a hospital in northern Gaza, and issued evacuation orders for several areas. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are continuing ceasefire talks in Qatar, but a senior Hamas source said that “no breakthrough or progress has been achieved so far”.</p>

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, appeared to win the first round of Poland's presidential election, narrowly edging out Karol Nowrocki, backed by the hard-right Law and Justice party. With no candidate securing a majority, a runoff election is scheduled for June 1. The election is viewed as crucial, as the winner will replace Andrzej Duda, a conservative ally of Law and Justice, potentially impacting Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to implement his agenda. Trzaskowski is seeking to appeal to voters beyond urban areas and those in rural parts of the country.</p>
