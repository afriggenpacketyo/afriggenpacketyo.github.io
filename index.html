          <p>BeOne Medicines, a Chinese global drug company, plans to introduce more cancer drugs to Hong Kong, leveraging recent drug-approval reforms. The company has already brought three cancer medications to the region and seeks approval for additional medical uses by year's end. BeOne's Guangzhou facility, which produces large molecule therapies, will expand production to supply Hong Kong in the future. The company's flagship product, a small-molecule drug, has driven profitability in global markets. The increased availability of cancer drugs will likely be a boon for patients in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. The pardon came shortly after reports that the Trump family's crypto venture was aided by a trading platform linked to Binance. Trump stated he pardoned Zhao based on recommendations from numerous individuals who believed Zhao was not guilty. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the pardon as an example of corruption, while Binance expressed gratitude to Trump for his leadership in the crypto space. The pardon marks a significant turn in the legal saga surrounding Zhao and Binance.</p>

Hamilton, recalling his own intense rivalry with Verstappen, emphasized the need for a cut-throat mentality to fend off Verstappen's challenge. George Russell acknowledged McLaren's superior car but cautioned against discounting Verstappen's consistent performance. The McLaren drivers are allowed to race freely, but must avoid crashing into each other. Verstappen stated that his team needs to be perfect to have a chance at winning, while Piastri described Red Bull's actions as "gamesmanship."</p>

          <p>A sprawling federal investigation has uncovered an elaborate poker gambling scheme allegedly operated by the mafia, involving celebrities and professional sports stars. The scheme reportedly cheated victims out of at least $7 million through rigged games using X-ray card tables, secret cameras, and pre-marked cards. Former professional athletes were allegedly enlisted to lure wealthy victims into the games, unaware that everyone involved was part of the scam. Authorities say the defendants laundered the funds through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges, and shell companies, with some profits allegedly funding the mafia's criminal enterprise. The arrests included members of La Costra Nostra crime families and former NBA players.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is investigating Vladimir Kramnik for allegations of cheating he made against fellow elite players, including Daniel Naroditsky, who recently passed away. FIDE is examining Kramnik's statements to determine if disciplinary actions are necessary. This investigation comes amid concerns about the increasing toxicity of public debate within the chess world. Naroditsky's death has prompted many to seek answers and remember his immense skill and contributions to the chess community. Kramnik has responded on social media, describing the FIDE's actions as "insulting and unfair."</p>

          <p>Alabama is set to execute Anthony Boyd using nitrogen gas, a controversial method of suffocation that defense lawyers describe as cruel and unusual punishment. The US Supreme Court has allowed the execution to proceed, despite opposition from liberal justices. If carried out, this will be the eighth time nitrogen gas has been used for execution, following its initial experimentation by Alabama in January 2024. Concerns have been raised about the track record of this new killing procedure, with witnesses reporting convulsions and visible suffering during previous executions. Boyd was sentenced to death for the murder of Gregory Huguley in 1995, though he maintains his innocence.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown, now in its 23rd day, shows no signs of ending, with both parties seeing political upside in extending the closure. The shutdown feels secondary to other major news stories and has become routine under the Trump administration. Trump has asserted authority to make war without Congress's approval and to impound funds appropriated by Congress. Democrats have incited the closure to resist Trump's actions and demand strong guardrails in any deal. The pain to the American economy and federal workers is real, but diffuse enough that no one in power is willing to compromise.</p>

          <p>A panel of US judges rejected an effort by the Trump administration to delay court rulings on claims by veterans who say they have been unfairly denied disability benefits. The court of appeals for veterans claims ruled against Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins' request to halt work on nearly all cases during the government shutdown. Veterans groups criticized Collins' action as an attempt to deny veterans their day in court. The court hears approximately 15,000 cases a year, granting claims or sending cases back to VA claims adjudicators to resolve errors.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration could expand its military attacks on alleged drug smugglers from Venezuela to include land operations. He is unsure whether he will seek congressional approval for these actions. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have justified the strikes by describing the alleged drug traffickers as terrorists. Democrats and some of Trump’s supporters have questioned the administration’s military strikes against Venezuela. Some analysts speculate that the anti-narcotics efforts are a pretext for ousting President Nicolás Maduro.</p>

Trump stated he plans to donate "millions of dollars" of his own money to the project, which is estimated to cost $300 million. The White House maintains that Trump does not need approval for the demolition, only for vertical construction. The project is being financed with Trump's funds and by private corporate donors, including tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a tentative ruling ordering that the government ensure immigrant detainees held in a Los Angeles processing center have access to legal counsel. The preliminary injunction extends a temporary restraining order requiring federal immigration agencies to allow legal visitation at the B-18 detention facility seven days a week. Judge Frimpong heard arguments on whether the government was violating detainees’ Fifth Amendment right to access counsel. The ruling addresses concerns about inhumane conditions and systemic denial of access to counsel at the facility. The ACLU and other groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of immigrant rights groups and individuals.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker signed an executive order to document alleged civil rights abuses by federal immigration enforcement agents in Chicago. Pritzker's newly created Illinois Accountability Commission will serve as a permanent record of alleged abuses by ICE and CBP officers under Operation Midway Blitz. The task force will capture and create a public record of federal law enforcement, recommending actions to hold the federal government accountable. Pritzker emphasized that Illinois is not waiting for Washington to act, pointing to recent legal victories against federal enforcement actions. He welcomed help from the FBI, DEA, and ATF to combat illegal guns and drugs, but rejected any military-style presence.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin has criticized Donald Trump's sanctions against two major oil firms as an "unfriendly act," though he insisted the tightened restrictions won't affect the nation's economy. Trump imposed sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil due to Russia's lack of commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. Putin warned the move could disrupt global oil markets and lead to higher prices for consumers. A proposed meeting between the two leaders was canceled by Trump. Lithuania claimed that Russian military aircraft briefly entered its airspace, which Russia denied.</p>
