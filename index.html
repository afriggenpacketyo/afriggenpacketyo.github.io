          <p>Delegations from Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey for a second round of direct peace talks, but expectations for a breakthrough remain low due to significant differences in their conditions for ending the three-year war. Fierce fighting continues along the front line, with both sides launching deep strikes into each other's territory, including a Ukrainian drone attack that reportedly destroyed over 40 Russian planes and Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv. Despite the ongoing conflict, Turkish officials are facilitating the talks, hoping to find a path toward de-escalation and resolution, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked for a full ceasefire and release of prisoners. The article highlights the persistent challenges and limited progress in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict. </p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist supported by Donald Trump, has won the Polish presidency in a close race, posing a challenge to the country's pro-EU government. Nawrocki's victory raises questions about Poland's future alignment with Brussels and Kyiv, as he succeeds Andrzej Duda and gains veto power over legislation. While the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued cooperation, Nawrocki's critical stance toward Kyiv and skepticism about Ukraine's NATO aspirations signal a potential shift in Poland's foreign policy. This outcome could hinder Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to implement pro-EU reforms and maintain strong relations with Ukraine. </p>

          <p>An Indian man was arrested at Mumbai airport for attempting to smuggle dozens of rare reptiles, including 44 venomous Indonesian pit vipers, into the country. Customs officials found the reptiles, along with three spider-tailed horned vipers and five Asian leaf turtles, concealed in the man's checked-in luggage. While importing animals is not illegal in India, the country's wildlife protection law prohibits the import of certain species, particularly those classified as endangered or protected. This incident is part of a pattern of customs officials intercepting passengers attempting to smuggle banned wildlife into India. </p>

The files, uncovered by the BBC, consist of communications from different branches of Syrian intelligence and verify that Tice was held in a detention facility in Damascus. Former Syrian officials corroborated this information, revealing that Tice was arrested near Damascus and held by a paramilitary force loyal to President Assad.

          <p>The debate over AI and copyright is intensifying, pitting the government against the creative industry regarding access to copyrighted material for AI development. The Data (Use and Access) Bill, aimed at balancing the tech and creative sectors, is stalled due to disagreements over fair compensation for content creators. The bill proposes that AI developers have access to all content unless owners opt out, while opponents advocate for mandatory disclosure and licensing of copyrighted material. This standoff highlights the complex challenges of regulating AI's use of creative content and its impact on artists' livelihoods. </p>
