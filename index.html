          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering a proposal to mint new one-dollar coins featuring President Donald Trump for the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, includes Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him pumping his fist with the engraved words "Fight, Fight, Fight" on the reverse. This initiative is being explored under the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, which permits commemorative $1 coins for one year starting in January 2026. However, this article highlights potential legal challenges from existing statutes that generally prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency and securities. Despite these provisions, historical precedents, such as a 1926 exception for President Calvin Coolidge, suggest Congress could make an allowance for this commemorative coin.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to significant portions of President Trump's Gaza ceasefire deal, including the release of all living and deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The group also expressed willingness to transfer the administration of the Gaza Strip to an independent Palestinian body, aligning with Trump's proposal. This development follows Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's prior endorsement of the plan and Trump's ultimatum for Hamas to accept the terms, which he later followed with a call for Israel to immediately cease bombing Gaza to ensure safe hostage extraction. While Hamas suggests other aspects, like weapon decommissioning, require further negotiation, this article highlights a critical, albeit complex, step towards ending the conflict that began on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense lawyers announced their intention to appeal his over four-year prison sentence, arguing that the judge unfairly considered conduct for which Combs was acquitted. Lead attorney Teny Geragos stated that the jury's "not guilty" verdict on sex trafficking and RICO counts should have precluded the judge from using such allegations to justify a harsher sentence. The legal team contends that the judge effectively acted as a "13th juror," letting unproven accusations influence the final judgment. While acknowledging the indefensible nature of a video showing Combs assaulting Casandra Ventura, his lawyers maintain he has accepted responsibility for domestic violence but not the more severe charges.</p>

          <p>China's biopharmaceutical sector is experiencing a significant renaissance, drawing international attention for its burgeoning drug-creation capabilities. A key example highlighted in this article is ivonescimab, a cancer drug developed by a Guangzhou firm, which demonstrated superior efficacy over Merck's bestselling Keytruda in delaying non-small-cell lung cancer progression. This achievement, alongside China having the world's second-highest number of novel drugs under development, signals the nation's growing prowess. However, analysts and experts question the long-term sustainability of such successes and the sector's capacity for truly novel breakthroughs within a complex and highly regulated industry. The article emphasizes the profound feeling among front-line doctors that China is currently in the best period of its biopharmaceutical sector's development.</p>

          <p>Hip-hop mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs was sentenced to just over four years in prison for prostitution-related offenses involving his two ex-girlfriends. Judge Arun Subramanian imposed a 50-month sentence, emphasizing the need for deterrence and accountability, despite Combs' attorneys arguing for a shorter term based on his 13 months already served and claims of reform. Combs publicly apologized in court for his "disgusting, shameful, and sick" actions, expressing deep remorse to his victims, his mother, and his seven children, most of whom were present. The conviction specifically pertained to two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution, while he was found not guilty of the more severe racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault charges. This article details the emotional courtroom proceedings, including statements from his children and the prosecutor's argument for a harsher sentence.</p>

          <p>The FBI is reportedly considering a "showy" public arrest and "perp walk" for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a proceeding. This article reveals that a supervisory special agent, Chris Ray, was suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in the plan, believing it to be inappropriate and highly unusual for a white-collar defendant. The potential public arrest follows President Trump's pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Comey, escalating their nearly decade-long feud. Critics, including the New York Civil Liberties Union during Comey's own prosecutorial tenure, argue that public perp walks undermine defendants' presumption of innocence. The charges against Comey accuse him of lying about authorizing anonymous sources for media reports on Hillary Clinton investigations.</p>

          <p>Republicans allege California is using a "loophole" in a complex Medicaid provision known as a "provider tax" to obtain matching federal dollars, which are then pooled to help fund the state's healthcare for undocumented immigrants. This article highlights a White House memo indicating Democrats aim to repeal Trump-era reforms designed to close this alleged backdoor tactic, intensifying a political debate. Former Fox News host Steve Hilton claims federal money is indeed funding non-emergency care for ineligible immigrants, while California Governor Gavin Newsom's office and other health policy experts insist these claims are false. The controversy is exacerbated by the absence of specific state records detailing how provider tax funds from the federal government are ultimately spent, making it challenging to definitively prove or disprove the allegations.</p>

          <p>Scientists are making significant progress in creating "living" computers, or "wetware," powered by human cells, a concept previously confined to science fiction. Researchers in Switzerland, particularly at FinalSpark lab, are developing neurons into organoids—tiny, lab-grown mini-brains—that can be attached to electrodes and respond to simple commands. This article highlights the potential for these biocomputers to replicate aspects of artificial intelligence learning processes while using a fraction of the energy of current methods. While still in early stages, facing challenges like sustaining organoids without blood vessels, this innovative field aims to complement silicon AI, offering new avenues for disease modeling, drug development for neurological conditions like Alzheimer's, and potentially reducing animal testing. The longevity of these organoids has reached up to four months, with scientists observing peculiar activity flurries before their demise.</p>

          <p>This article offers a personal reflection on the dramatic evolution of China's education system, viewed through the experiences of a rural-born individual and her children. The author recounts how education served as an escape route from rural poverty in the 1980s, where "knowledge is power" was a guiding creed, leading to a prestigious university and a transformed life. However, her father expresses confusion over the current landscape, where urban parents now invest heavily in "school district apartments" in areas like Xicheng, which are significantly more expensive but offer a nearly 20% higher rate of students getting into top-tier universities. This shift from a system with limited key high schools to one where urban Beijingers "pick and choose" highlights the increasing competition and economic pressures shaping educational opportunities in contemporary China, creating new disparities.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark measure allowing over 800,000 rideshare drivers to unionize and collectively bargain for improved wages and benefits, while crucially retaining their independent contractor status. This article highlights the legislation as a significant compromise, marking the largest expansion of private-sector collective bargaining rights in the state's history after years of contention between labor unions and tech companies like Uber and Lyft. Newsom explicitly contrasted this move towards worker protection with federal actions under the Trump administration, emphasizing California's commitment to competence over chaos. In exchange for these collective bargaining rights, Uber and Lyft are expected to benefit from reduced insurance requirements for accidents involving uninsured or underinsured drivers, a deal that aims to lower costs for riders and create stronger driver voices.</p>

Roske, who traveled from Los Angeles with a firearm, ammunition, and other weapons, pleaded guilty after being apprehended near Kavanaugh's home in June 2022. This article highlights Roske's stated remorse and mental health struggles, which she claimed therapy and medication helped her address, leading her to recognize that "violence (political or otherwise) is not the solution." Prosecutors had sought at least 30 years, citing Roske's Google searches about killing justices. The case underscores a growing trend of political violence against public figures in an increasingly polarized nation, a concern also voiced by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who emphasized that violence should not be the price of public service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to offer unaccompanied immigrant children aged 14 and older $2,500 to voluntarily self-deport, a policy revealed in a memo from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This article highlights this as a significant departure from longstanding immigration policy, which typically requires legal consultation and judicial approval for minors' voluntary departure. Immigration lawyers and advocates express alarm, fearing the incentive exploits vulnerable children and pressures them to abandon legal claims, potentially returning them to danger. Critics also suggest the program could fuel family separations and is part of a broader "sustained assault on children’s access to legal counsel."</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs appeared stunned and held his head in his hands as a judge handed down a 50-month prison sentence for prostitution-related offenses, despite his emotional pleas for mercy. This article details the courtroom scene where Combs, who had been incarcerated for 13 months, expressed "accountability and responsibility" and vowed to devote himself to family and community. Judge Arun Subramanian remained unmoved by defense arguments citing racial justice, childhood trauma, and Combs' former position as a business and Black community leader. Instead, the judge emphasized the repeated nature of Combs' crimes and abuse, noting his continued abusive behavior even after public apologies. The judge lavished praise on victims like Cassie Ventura and "Jane" for coming forward, calling them "strong women" and stating that Combs had the power and resources to perpetuate his subjugation.</p>

This article highlights the 72-year-old grandmother's decision to attend, feeling a responsibility to see the proceedings through, despite the immense personal toll. Her story of being drugged and sexually assaulted by dozens of men recruited by her husband for over a decade shocked the world. While the initial trial saw 46 men convicted of sexual assault, the appeal by Husamettin Dogan means Pelicot will again face the traumatic videos and arguments, further exacerbated by a deep family split over allegations of incest involving her daughter.</p>

          <p>Despite anti-China protests in Myeongdong and Daelim-dong, districts frequented by Chinese travelers in South Korea, scheduled flights between the two countries are operating as expected, and South Korea remains a top destination for Chinese tourists. This article reports that analysts believe the demonstrations have failed to deter tourists, partly because both governments oppose the protests and public safety remains normal. The Chinese embassy "regretfully noted" the rallies, but the lack of official discouragement from Beijing suggests that economic and diplomatic relations are prioritized over public sentiment in this instance. This situation indicates that, for now, geopolitical tensions, while present, are not significantly impacting tourism flows or broader economic interactions between the two Asian nations, though a future fall in tourism is still considered possible by some.</p>

          <p>Apple and Google removed apps that alert users to nearby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, including "ICEBlock," following pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi. This article highlights legal experts' condemnation of Apple's capitulation, viewing it as a concerning instance of "jawboning" where government officials censor speech through intimidation and threats. Critics argue that such actions erode First Amendment protections and set a dangerous precedent, especially as Apple CEO Tim Cook has sought to ingratiate himself with the Trump administration amidst aggressive tariff policies. The developers of ICEBlock blamed political pressure, asserting the app's service was a protected form of speech, akin to Apple's own mapping features that crowdsource police speed traps. Cornell law professor Gautam Hans believes Apple would have a jawboning case but does not expect the company to pursue it.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals widespread apprehension among Americans, who overwhelmingly decry political violence as unacceptable yet anticipate its increase in the coming years. This article highlights that this consensus spans all political affiliations and age groups, with older Americans particularly firm in their rejection. The concern over political violence is linked to a majority's pessimism about bridging political divides, despite generally positive views on interpersonal relations. Fewer than half of Americans feel comfortable expressing political views publicly, and most rarely discuss politics with those holding different opinions, reflecting a deeply polarized and cautious society where civility is perceived to have worsened.</p>

An Amazon spokesperson stated that "certain locations work better than others," confirming efforts to relocate affected employees within the company. The company, which has been determined to be a major grocery player for nearly two decades, is re-evaluating its Fresh chain's stand-out appeal, having already removed its "Just Walk Out" cashierless technology from stores last year.

This article analyzes the group's statement, which accepts the exchange formula from President Trump's proposal—including the release of all living and deceased Israeli hostages for hundreds of detained Palestinians—and the idea of handing Gaza's governance to Palestinian technocrats. However, crucial elements like Hamas laying down its arms are notably absent from the response. The article suggests the Israeli government will scrutinize the wording to determine genuine intent, especially after Trump's call for an immediate halt to Gaza bombing. While Trump hailed it as a "big day," the analysis underscores that substantial details still require resolution before peace in the region becomes a reality.</p>

Cramer suggested that the economy, excluding data center-related business, is getting weaker and emphasized the need for the Fed to act decisively. He also noted that Constellation Brands' stock has fallen due to Hispanic consumers pulling back on purchases amid concerns about President Donald Trump's immigration policies and potential job losses.

          <p>A federal appeals court in Boston ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the U.S. illegally or temporarily, marking another legal setback for the president's birthright order. This article highlights the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld lower courts' preliminary injunctions, concluding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed based on the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. California Attorney General Rob Bonta welcomed the ruling, affirming the constitutional principle of birthright citizenship and calling the order a "flagrantly unlawful attempt."

This ruling reinforces the established tradition of birthright citizenship against presidential challenges.</p>
