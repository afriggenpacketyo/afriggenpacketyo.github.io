          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial has commenced in New York City, with accusations of running a criminal enterprise since 2004. Combs is accused of manipulating women into commercial sex acts, sometimes with male sex workers, during drug-fueled parties. Key evidence includes a 2016 video showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Ventura had previously filed a lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of sexual assault and physical abuse, which was later settled. The trial is expected to last eight to ten weeks and will include testimony from an FBI analyst, a male escort, and Ventura.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Todd Blanche, his former defense lawyer, as the acting Librarian of Congress, raising eyebrows due to Blanche's lack of experience in libraries or archives. The appointment follows the firing of Carla Hayden, the previous Librarian of Congress, who was targeted by conservative groups. Blanche, previously known for his work in investigations and criminal litigation, including defending Trump in a hush money trial, will now oversee the largest library in the world. The Library of Congress is a legislative branch agency, and has not yet received direction from Congress on how to move forward.</p>

New York City tops the list, requiring an annual income of roughly $135,000 to afford rent. The issue is driven by inadequate housing supply and rising demand.

The investigation, involving U.S. and Ivorian law enforcement, identified several alleged money laundering accomplices. The government of Ivory Coast doesn’t extradite its own citizens, so those arrested will be prosecuted in their own country.</p>

Trump stated that Cook is planning to increase Apple's investments in the U.S., including building more plants. Apple had previously announced plans to spend $500 billion to expand its operations in the U.S. The cooling of U.S.-China trade tensions is expected to benefit Apple, which manufactures the majority of its devices in China.</p>

          <p>During Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs' trial on sex crime allegations, a former security guard, Israel Florez, testified that Combs offered him cash and told him, "Don't tell nobody," after an assault on Cassie Ventura. Florez, now an LAPD officer, claims he pinned Combs against a wall after the incident. Combs' defense team acknowledged the video showed "horrible, dehumanizing violence" but argued it wasn't proof of sex trafficking. Ventura is expected to testify in court.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police are leading an investigation into a "suspicious" fire at Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's house in north London. The Metropolitan Police said there was damage to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt. The property has been rented out. Police said counter-terrorism officers were leading the probe "as a precaution and due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure".</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing to repel a Russian invasion, including a plan to train every adult male in the country to be ready for war. This is due to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and President Trump's efforts to change the U.S. relationship with Europe and NATO. Poland shares a 500-mile border with Russia and Russian ally Belarus.</p>
