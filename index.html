          <p>US Ambassador Mike Waltz labeled several incidents during President Donald Trump's UN speech, including an escalator malfunction and teleprompter failure, as "unacceptable." Waltz, appearing on FOX Business, suggested these mishaps were intentional attempts to sabotage the president. He announced the US would withhold funding until the United Nations implements sweeping reforms, criticizing its bureaucracy and demanding transparency. The Secret Service is currently investigating the incidents, which Waltz emphasized occurred only during Trump's address.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) is under scrutiny for involving tech investor Harriet Green in a cost-cutting initiative at West Northamptonshire Council. Green, whose firm invests in companies that work with local government, is slated to access sensitive council data, prompting concerns about potential conflicts of interest and unfair competitive advantages for businesses backed by her company. Local councillors have raised questions regarding the appropriateness of her role and the potential for legal issues, as Reform UK seeks to use this as a model for other councils.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who accused the firm of illegally pirating nearly half a million books to train its chatbots. The agreement, which will pay approximately $3,000 per book, addresses past infringements but not future works. Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers lauded the settlement as a landmark step, signaling to AI companies that copyright infringement comes with a significant cost. Anthropic expressed satisfaction, noting the court's earlier ruling that AI training is transformative fair use remains intact, with this settlement resolving specific acquisition claims.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump stated he would not permit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, ahead of their upcoming meeting. Trump also indicated that a deal on Gaza was "pretty close," amidst growing international pressure on Israel to end the conflict and occupation. This declaration comes as numerous Western states have formally recognized an independent Palestinian state, intensifying global calls for a peaceful resolution. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, speaking at the UN, expressed readiness to work on a French-announced peace plan, while reiterating Hamas would have no governance role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Senate Bill 576, introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, aims to prevent streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from playing commercials at excessively loud volumes, a problem federal law currently addresses for traditional broadcasters. The bill was inspired by an 8-month-old baby, Samantha, who was frequently woken by blaring ads, prompting her parents to advocate for change. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the legislation could establish a de facto national standard, as companies often avoid creating different policies for California. The Motion Picture Association has opposed the bill, citing challenges in controlling ad sources.</p>

          <p>The UK's inaugural stem cell collection center, exclusively dedicated to transplants, has opened at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, aiming to significantly increase life-saving donations. Run by the Anthony Nolan charity in partnership with NIHR, the center is expected to create 1,300 new donation slots annually, addressing a critical global shortage of cell collection facilities. This initiative is crucial for patients with blood cancers and disorders, who often face life-threatening delays due to capacity issues. Donors, like Jordan from London, expressed pride in contributing to this vital effort, which simplifies the donation process and offers hope for recipients.</p>

          <p>US country music star Luke Combs highlights the surging popularity of country music in the UK, noting it as the fastest-growing genre among British listeners. Ahead of a historic Grand Ole Opry performance in London, Combs remarked on the unique engagement of UK fans, who consume entire albums and focus intently on lyrics, contrasting with the louder, more "melee" atmosphere of US shows. He attributes this growth partly to streaming services making the genre more accessible and the band's consistent effort to tour internationally. The Opry's first performance outside the US at the Royal Albert Hall signifies this expanding global appeal.</p>

Additionally, a 25% tariff will be imposed on heavy-duty trucks and 50% on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, effective October 1. Trump stated these measures are designed to protect American manufacturers from "unfair outside competition" and foreign "flooding" of products.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban centers worldwide are experiencing a significant surge in rat populations, dubbed "Ratmageddon," with pest control companies reporting remarkable increases in callouts. This phenomenon is attributed to rising global temperatures, particularly warmer winters, which allow rats to breed more frequently. Additionally, human factors such as increased fast food consumption, less frequent rubbish collection, and urban development creating more habitats contribute to the problem. The article highlights the health risks associated with rats and the challenges in controlling their numbers, suggesting that better urban sanitation is key to mitigation.</p>
