          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 15:18:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding Oklahoma's efforts to establish the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which could potentially divert public funds to religious institutions. Attorney General Gentner Drummond argues that approving the school would violate the state's requirement for charter schools to be nonsectarian and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Supporters of the school contend that excluding religious institutions from public benefits is unconstitutional discrimination. Justice Amy Coney Barrett has recused herself from the case, raising the possibility of a 4-4 deadlock and the decision is expected by the end of June or early July.</p>

Haley's testimony, closely scrutinized by the defense, mirrors her previous account from Weinstein's initial trial. The case is part of the #MeToo movement, with prosecutors alleging Weinstein used his influence to coerce women into sexual encounters. Weinstein faces additional charges related to alleged sexual assaults of Jessica Mann and Kaja Sokola, and his lawyers claim the relationships were consensual.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration has finalized a trade deal with an unnamed country, pending approval from its prime minister and parliament. While Lutnick did not disclose the specific country, he clarified that it was not China, as those negotiations are overseen by the Treasury Secretary. This announcement follows President Trump's implementation of widespread tariff hikes, some of which have been temporarily paused.

          <p>The White House criticized Amazon's reported plan to display tariff costs on imported goods as a "hostile and political act," with press secretary Karoline Leavitt questioning the timing. Amazon, however, denied the report, stating that the idea of listing import charges on certain products was considered but never approved. President Trump confirmed he spoke with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who quickly addressed the issue. The potential move by Amazon follows tariff hikes imposed by the Trump administration on goods imported from China, leading to increased prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>HELOC interest rates experienced a decline in early 2025, reaching an 18-month low in February and continuing to drop in March, but recent market turbulence has caused some volatility. The article suggests that if early 2025 trends continue, HELOC rates are likely to drop again in May, influenced by upcoming economic reports like the unemployment rate and inflation data. Borrowers should also consider fixed-rate home equity loans as an alternative due to the unpredictable economic climate. Homeowners should carefully weigh their options before borrowing against their home equity.</p>

While UPS cites a focus on revenue quality and profitability as reasons for the reduced Amazon shipments, Amazon claims it offered to increase UPS's volume. UPS also acknowledges the potential impact of global trade policy shifts on its business, particularly the trade war between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric significantly impacted the Canadian election, leading to a Liberal victory despite initial forecasts favoring the Conservatives. Trump's tariff war and threats to annex Canada transformed the election into a referendum on national identity, benefiting the more America-skeptical Liberals. The Liberals replaced Justin Trudeau with Mark Carney, a former central banker, who appealed to Canadians seeking effective leadership against Trump. The election outcome signals a shift towards interventionist policies in Canada and a decline in American influence.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt becoming increasingly expensive, bankruptcy is becoming a more common solution. Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or liquidation bankruptcy, allows for the erasure of most unsecured debts, including credit card balances, but may require giving up non-exempt assets. Chapter 13 bankruptcy, or reorganization bankruptcy, sets up a repayment plan over three to five years. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt settlement, debt management plans, and debt consolidation loans.

          <p>Paul Mescal will appear in two National Theatre productions, "Death of a Salesman" and "A Whistle in the Dark," as the Lyttelton Theatre returns to a repertory model. Other stars, including Monica Barbaro and Nicola Coughlan, will also feature in new shows, while Stormzy will collaborate with the theatre on a new production. Indhu Rubasingham, the National Theatre's new artistic director, aims to create a "cut-through show that goes beyond theatre" with Stormzy's involvement. Letitia Wright will star in "The Story," and a new musical based on the film "Pride" is also planned.</p>
