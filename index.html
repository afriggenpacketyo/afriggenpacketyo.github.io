          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is slated to attend China's "Victory Day" military parade in Beijing, a notable diplomatic event marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War Two surrender. This visit, his first to China in over six years, will see him alongside Russia's Vladimir Putin and other heads of state, underscoring Chinese leader Xi Jinping's ambition for a new global order. The highly choreographed event will showcase China's latest military technology, including a fully displayed new force structure. Kim's presence offers Xi a strategic advantage by providing direct briefings from both leaders ahead of potential summits with US President Trump, who is concurrently working on a Ukraine peace deal and considering an Asia visit.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are experiencing a significant bull run, with one software engineer reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating another 20% through early next year. This optimism is largely based on a government pledge to stabilize stocks within a shaky economy, aiming to generate a "wealth effect" that could stimulate consumption. Traders are strategically concentrating their equity exposure in high-beta stocks across new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware companies, which tend to rise more during market stabilization or comebacks. This article highlights the prevailing sentiment among individual investors who are leveraging perceived government backing to capitalize on current market movements and seek further gains.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $950 million for the upcoming Saturday night drawing, making it the game's sixth-largest prize ever. This surge occurred after no tickets matched the winning numbers for Wednesday night's roughly $850 million jackpot, which was the sixth-largest at the time. The estimated cash value for Saturday's pot of gold is $428.9 million before taxes, with Powerball officials noting a doubling of ticket sales in the past week. A single jackpot winner would have the option of a lump sum payment or an annuity spread over 30 years, facing formidable odds of 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

The individuals, Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle, are affiliated with the "No Azure for Apartheid" group, which protests Microsoft's direct and indirect support for the Israeli military's alleged use of its software in Gaza. Smith reported that protesters blocked access, planted listening devices in the form of phones, and refused to leave until removed by police. Microsoft is actively investigating the incidents and cooperating fully with law enforcement, following earlier campus protests that led to 20 arrests, with 16 of those never having worked at the company.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix saw slight gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 remained flat, buoyed by record-high Qantas shares following strong full-year earnings. Conversely, India's Nifty 50 opened lower as secondary US tariffs of 25% on Indian shipments took effect, pushing overall duties to 50% and intensifying risks to the Indian economy, despite expectations for continued trade talks.

          <p>South Korea's central bank maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, primarily to further assess housing prices and household debt in the capital region. Despite holding rates steady, the Bank of Korea upgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% and GDP growth projection to 0.9%, citing modest improvements in economic growth and stable inflation. The article notes that while domestic demand is expected to recover due to a supplementary budget and improved consumer sentiment, exports might gradually slow as the impacts of US tariffs expand. This decision follows recent agreements between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and US President Donald Trump, involving multibillion-dollar investment pledges and reciprocal tariff reductions.

Among the passengers is Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping, who emphasizes the importance of remembering this history. Till, 14, was kidnapped and lynched after reportedly whistling at a white woman, and his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral in Chicago is credited with sparking the modern Civil Rights Movement.

This worsening fire season is directly linked to climate change, making fire-prone conditions more likely and releasing record amounts of CO2, with Spain alone seeing 17.68 million tonnes. Experts warn of more frequent and severe fires in the future, exacerbated by rural depopulation that leaves agricultural land overgrown and highly flammable.</p>

The facility, run by Florida's state government as part of the Trump administration's push to expand detention beds, faced criticism for inhumane conditions including lack of water and limited attorney access.

          <h2>All NATO Members Meet 2% Defense Spending Target, But Few Reach New 3.5% Goal</h2>

          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, according to a new NATO report. This marks a significant increase since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and following demands from US President Donald Trump for European allies to invest more. However, only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the new, higher goal of 3.5% of GDP agreed upon in The Hague in June. While the United States contributes the lion's share in absolute terms, its spending is estimated at 3.22% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the importance of converting funds into genuine military capability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Capitol Hill is implementing new measures to address rising politically motivated violence, including a pilot program offering lawmakers up to $20,000 for home security upgrades and $5,000 monthly for personal security. This initiative follows nearly 9,500 threats and concerning statements made against Congress in 2024, along with recent violent incidents like the assassination attempt on President Trump and fatal shootings of Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota. Representatives Hillary Scholten and Tim Burchett express constant vigilance, emphasizing that politically motivated violence is not a partisan issue. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated the program, running through fiscal year 2025, will be evaluated for its effectiveness in protecting member security.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila, two employees at an Ontario surgery center, on felony charges of assaulting, resisting, and impeding federal officers. The charges stem from an incident where US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers attempted to detain landscapers who ran into the facility to escape authorities. According to court documents, Davila allegedly interfered with an arrest by wedging herself in front of an officer and shouting, while Ortega allegedly grabbed an officer’s arm and vest. This indictment marks a continuation of US Attorney Bill Essayli’s aggressive approach to prosecuting individuals arrested during ICE operations and protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pre-owned Tesla Cybertruck market is experiencing an "unprecedented" decline in value, with average prices plummeting nearly 30% in the past year to just over $84,000. This trend reflects a broader hit to all used Tesla vehicles, whose average price is down 14% year-over-year. Experts attribute the downturn partly to CEO Elon Musk, alongside a massive decrease in new car sales for Tesla in 2025, signaling a troubling market trend. The Cybertruck's initial release price, which doubled earlier estimates of under $40,000, and its dwindling resale value have led some to question its long-term viability, with one user noting Tesla stopped taking Cybertrucks as trade-ins.

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales growth projected to remain above 50% this quarter, signaling robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite these strong overall results, the stock slipped in extended trading as data center revenue fell short of estimates for the second consecutive period. Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress anticipates between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade, with the company's growth primarily driven by its data center business. The article highlights that H20 chip sales to China were zero due to geopolitical factors, though $180 million worth of H20 inventory was released to a customer outside of China.

Protesters shouted "Out with Milei!" as his security scrambled to shield him, and scuffles broke out between his supporters and opponents, resulting in injuries to one supporter. The event follows a scandal involving leaked audio recordings from a former disability agency head, alleging that Milei's sister pocketed money intended for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>After a significant delay of over two and a half years, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, President of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison. This appointment fulfills a key campaign promise amidst growing frustration from film industry advocates, who felt the city's future as a film capital was in peril. The role is crucial for helping filmmakers navigate city bureaucracy, especially as Los Angeles faces a broader slump in production jobs due to tax incentives in other states and countries. Kang will be assisted by Dan Halden and producer Amy Goldberg, with the mayor emphasizing ongoing efforts to keep production jobs local and support small businesses reliant on the industry.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is experiencing an unprecedented escalation of federal law enforcement presence, with National Guard troops deployed and federal agents conducting aggressive immigration raids. While the National Guard has been observed in mundane tasks like litter collection, President Trump's broader "law, order, and crime agenda" includes "massive enforcement operations" targeting gangs, drug dealers, and "criminal aliens." Locals in diverse neighborhoods like Mount Pleasant express palpable fear and anger, witnessing ICE agents detaining individuals on their way to work, with some residents calling it "brutalizing people" and a "Donald Trump dominance performance." This article suggests the US capital feels like it's "creeping towards a tipping point" as Trump leverages presidential authority to control local law enforcement and implement aggressive policies.</p>

          <p>Susan Monarez, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was fired less than a month into her role by the White House, which stated she was not "aligned with" President Trump's agenda and refused to resign. Her lawyers contend she was targeted for defending science, criticizing a "systematic dismantling of public health institutions" and "dangerous politicization of science." This abrupt ousting triggered the resignations of at least four top CDC officials, including Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who lamented the "weaponization of public health" and "dubious intent" of new vaccine policy leaders. Monarez's brief, tumultuous tenure also saw a shooting at the CDC campus and a cancelled "all hands meeting" for staff, contributing to low morale.</p>
