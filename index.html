            <p>Hong Kong developer Swire Properties remains confident in mainland China's market, anticipating rental income growth despite the ongoing tariff war between China and the US. CEO Tim Blackburn noted that while volatility is detrimental to business, positive opportunities still exist. The company is actively seeking retail investment prospects in Shenzhen, driven by the trend of increased domestic consumption. Swire Properties has committed a substantial HK$100 billion investment plan for projects across Hong Kong, mainland China, and Southeast Asia, with a significant portion already allocated to mainland ventures.

            <p>Promoter Bob Arum believes Tyson Fury will not return to boxing after his recent retirement announcement, despite rivals calling him out. Arum suggests that Fury, having achieved financial security, may lack the motivation for the rigorous training required. Fury's last three fights were in Saudi Arabia, and he holds a record of 34 wins, one draw, and two defeats, both against Oleksandr Usyk. Eddie Hearn speculates a fight between Fury and Anthony Joshua could still happen if Fury initiates it.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is launching investigations into pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports, potentially leading to tariffs based on national security concerns. Notices posted to the Federal Register indicate a 21-day public comment period, with the administration acting under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The US relies heavily on chip imports from Taiwan, and the investigation will also include pharmaceutical ingredients. Drugmakers have cautioned that tariffs could cause shortages and limit patient access, while Trump argues for increased domestic drug manufacturing.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen over $2 billion in federal funding for Harvard University after the institution rejected a list of demands aimed at combating antisemitism on campus. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights, despite the government's overreach. The demands included changes to governance, hiring practices, and admissions procedures, which Harvard deemed an attempt to control its community.

            <p>Mexico is grappling with the question of whether to ban narcocorridos, a genre of music that glorifies drug trafficking, in an attempt to reduce violence. President Claudia Sheinbaum opposes a ban, advocating for social awareness to discourage the glorification of drug trafficking. However, voices within her own party support prohibition, although such measures have faced criticism and doubts about their effectiveness. Attempts to ban corridos have existed for decades, with experts suggesting that the new wave of prohibition is driven by political demagoguery or the relationship with the United States.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Commerce Department is conducting a national security investigation into imports of semiconductor technology and related downstream products, potentially leading to new tariffs. The investigation encompasses a wide range of items, including chip components, chipmaking equipment, and products containing semiconductors. This move has significant implications for Trump's global trade war, as he seeks to boost U.S. manufacturing. While some electronics products have been granted exemptions, the semiconductor investigation sets the stage for future tariffs.</p>

            <p>The FIA and F1 manufacturers are debating the future of engines in Formula 1, balancing the desire for louder, more traditional engines with the need for efficiency and modern technology. FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem had pushed for a return to V10 naturally aspirated engines, but manufacturers opposed the idea. A simplified hybrid engine format is a possibility, with a V8 engine and a hybrid component contributing 20-30% of the total power output. Fernando Alonso emphasized the importance of pragmatism and understanding that the world has evolved.</p>
