          <p>The article explores the rediscovery of the kingdom of Kaabu, a West African power that existed from the 1500s to the 1800s, through the oral histories preserved in the songs of griots. Archaeologists have begun excavating Kansala, the kingdom's capital, confirming the griots' stories and providing physical evidence of Kaabu's existence and importance. The excavation is a collaborative effort, involving local communities and griots, to ensure that Africans can tell their own history from their perspective. The project aims to transform archaeological findings into songs, fostering a dialogue between archaeologists and griots, which is a spiritual experience for all involved. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>The United States is witnessing a troubling trend: the return of psychiatric imprisonment, rebranded as modern mental health care, including proposals to expand involuntary commitment and labor-based "wellness farms." These policies expand the state’s power to detain and “treat” marginalized people, reinforcing carceral control, particularly over disabled, unhoused, racialized, and LGBTQIA+ communities. The federal government is dismantling critical agencies supporting mental health and low-income communities. Coercion is not care, and community-based solutions are needed to prioritize dignity, autonomy, and support over surveillance and confinement. Optimism score: 30</p>

Over 400 university presidents signed a statement denouncing the administration's "unprecedented government overreach," and Harvard sued the administration over threats to cut federal funding. However, universities are also stepping up measures to suppress pro-Palestinian discourse, leading to criticism of universities suppressing free speech.

          <p>Elon Musk is reducing his role overseeing the unofficial “department of government efficiency,” or Doge, to focus on Tesla, raising questions about the future of the initiative. Doge was created to modernize federal technology and software, but its mandate expanded to include spending and staff cuts, leading to over 260,000 federal workers being fired or taking buyouts. Concerns persist that Doge will use its access to sensitive government data to build centralized systems benefiting both Musk’s business interests and Trump’s agenda, including a database to expedite deportations of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue Doge's savings claims are inflated and that it may end up costing more than it saves. Optimism score: 35</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at Iran's Shahid Rajaee port has resulted in at least 28 deaths and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage and prompting school and office closures. The explosion, which occurred on Saturday morning, is believed to have been caused by flammable materials stored in unsealed containers. A maritime risk consultancy suggested the containers held solid fuel for ballistic missiles, though the exact cause remains unconfirmed.

          <p>As Vietnam prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the government is subtly tweaking the narrative of its victory. While the official designation remains "The Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day," the shorthand "Reunification Day" is gaining prominence. This shift reflects an effort to promote national reconciliation and bridge the gap with Vietnamese who grew up abroad. Despite the fanfare, the anniversary highlights the complex history and ongoing debates surrounding the Vietnam War. Optimism score: 60</p>
