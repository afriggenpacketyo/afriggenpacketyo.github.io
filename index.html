            <p>Emily Ley, owner of Simplified, a stationery business in Florida, is suing the Trump administration over tariffs on Chinese imports. Ley argues that the tariffs, totaling 145%, are crippling her business because she relies on China's manufacturing infrastructure. She claims she has already paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs and faces up to $1 million more this year, forcing her to consider reducing salaries and jobs. The lawsuit, backed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance, alleges the tariffs were enacted illegally by bypassing Congressional approval. (not investment advice)</p>

With £80 million in funding, the scheme will enable GPs to access specialist advice quickly for conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and menopause symptoms. The goal is to help two million people receive faster care in their local communities by the end of 2025/26, diverting 660,000 treatments from hospitals between July and December 2024. The scheme, called 'Advice and Guidance,' aims to provide tests and treatments in the most convenient place for patients.</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has threatened to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for allegedly defying an order to return Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador. Boasberg accuses the administration of "willful disregard" for his orders, citing the use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The judge gave the administration one week to either take the migrants back into U.S. custody or provide the names of those who decided against halting the transfer. If the Justice Department declines to prosecute, Boasberg may appoint a private attorney, potentially setting up a constitutional crisis.</p>

Ronni Ancona noted the "cheap shot" linking fluoride to Wood's teeth.

            <p>MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an election denier, claims he is financially ruined and unable to pay the $50,000 in sanctions ordered by Smartmatic over "frivolous" election claims. Lindell tearfully pleaded with the judge to allow him to wait until the final judgment to make any payment, citing financial difficulties and "lawfare." He claims he was forced to lay off hundreds of employees, lost warehouse units, and owes millions to the IRS. The judge gave Lindell until Friday to provide financial statements to prove his claims.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has proposed a rule to redefine "harm" under the Endangered Species Act, limiting it to direct actions that kill or injure protected species. Conservationists argue this change would remove protections against habitat destruction, which is crucial for the survival of many vulnerable plants and animals. The proposal would potentially allow for increased development and resource extraction on public lands. If adopted, the change is likely to face legal challenges from conservation groups.</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes consumer companies will be forced to cut prices despite new tariffs, as consumers are already fed up with high-priced goods. He cites luxury goods company LVMH's sales decline as evidence of this trend. Cramer suggests companies are hesitant to lower prices due to concerns about gross margins and earnings. He proposes mergers as a potential alternative to cost-cutting, creating new opportunities to prevent margin decline. (not investment advice)</p>

To observe the shower, viewers need a clear, dark sky away from city lights and should allow their eyes to adjust to the darkness.</p>

This suggests that the planet may be teeming with microbial life. However, researchers emphasize that more observations are needed to confirm these findings and rule out non-biological explanations.</p>
