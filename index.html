          <p>The White House has announced that former President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. A White House spokesperson framed the pardon as a response to what they described as the Biden Administration's "war on cryptocurrency." This executive action absolves Zhao of his federal conviction, a move that has generated significant discussion within the financial and political spheres.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Miami Heat player Terry Rozier has been arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy in a federal case involving illegal sports betting. Prosecutors allege that Rozier and five other defendants used nonpublic information about NBA player injuries to gain an unfair advantage and defraud sportsbooks. The FBI described the case as a wide-sweeping criminal enterprise that blurred lines between professional sports and organized crime. Rozier's attorney maintains his client's innocence, stating that he was previously cleared by the NBA and that the arrest was a publicity stunt by prosecutors.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to endorse former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the upcoming mayoral election, just before the start of early voting. This move comes after Adams ended his own tumultuous reelection campaign, which was hampered by low polling numbers and a federal indictment that was later dropped. Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Zohran Mamdani, is currently polling second. The endorsement is seen as a strategic attempt to consolidate support against Mamdani in a contentious three-way race that also includes Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p>

          <p>Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups is among 34 individuals charged in a nationwide illegal gambling takedown by federal authorities. The charges allege his involvement in a sophisticated, Mafia-tied poker operation that used advanced technology, like rigged shuffling machines, to cheat players out of millions of dollars. The sprawling enterprise reportedly involved members of the Bonanno, Gambino, and Genovese crime families and stretched across several major U.S. cities. This case is related to a separate NBA prop betting scheme that also resulted in the arrest of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier.</p>

          <p>The British government has refused to allocate parliamentary time for a debate on Prince Andrew's titles and his taxpayer-funded residence, effectively halting legislative efforts to strip him of his dukedom. This decision follows renewed public pressure after Virginia Giuffre's memoir detailed her allegations against the prince and his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. While Prince Andrew has agreed to stop using his titles, only an act of Parliament can formally remove them. The government cited a desire not to detract from other important issues, though some members of Parliament are still seeking to investigate the lease arrangements for his Royal Lodge home.</p>

          <p>A new Suffolk University poll in Virginia's gubernatorial race shows Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger with a single-digit lead over Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, 52% to 43%. However, the down-ballot races for lieutenant governor and attorney general appear much closer, with one being a statistical tie. The election is viewed as a key barometer for President Trump's second-term agenda and the upcoming midterm elections. The race has recently tightened following a controversy involving controversial texts from the Democratic candidate for attorney general, putting the entire Democratic ticket on the defensive in the final days of the campaign.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers, particularly first-timers. Despite the increase in sales and a slight rise in inventory, the market remains tight, continuing to exert upward pressure on prices. The median home price was $415,200, marking a 2.1% year-over-year increase and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains, keeping prices 53% higher than pre-pandemic levels.

He strongly condemned the Parachute Regiment's actions on that day, saying they had "totally lost all sense of military discipline" and shot unarmed civilians.

          <p>This article presents a first-person account from a recent Stanford graduate who transitioned from progressive to conservative during college, arguing that the real political energy on campus is now on the right. The author suggests that a campus culture that stifles open debate and fears causing offense has inadvertently made conservative spaces more appealing to students seeking genuine intellectual discourse. Rather than being driven by Trumpism, this trend is fueled by a reaction against what is perceived as the stifling authority of the establishment left. The piece notes that conservative student groups are growing while some leftist counterparts are becoming defunct.</p>

While the blob's effects are most pronounced on the coast, it could also contribute to more severe winter weather in eastern North America by disrupting larger weather patterns.

Before 1980, agencies often continued operating during funding gaps, but legal opinions from the Carter administration established that they lacked the authority to do so. Since then, there have been numerous shutdowns, including eight during the Reagan presidency and the longest on record, a 35-day shutdown in 2018 under President Trump. These events, which occur when Congress fails to approve federal spending, have historically led to furloughed workers and significant economic costs, with the 2018 shutdown causing an estimated $3 billion in permanent losses.</p>

          <p>The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed the $38 trillion mark for the first time, a milestone reached as the federal government remains shut down. Fiscal policy experts note that shutdowns can worsen the national debt by disrupting economic activity, delaying tax collection, and incurring extra costs associated with pausing and restarting federal programs. The debt has been accelerating rapidly, growing from $37 trillion to $38 trillion in just two months. This growing debt burden leads to higher interest payments for the government, which are projected to total $14 trillion over the next decade, potentially crowding out other essential public spending.

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is forecast to bring days of heavy rain to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center has warned that the slow-moving storm could produce 5 to 10 inches of rain through Sunday, creating the risk of life-threatening flash floods and landslides. While the storm is not expected to significantly impact the U.S. mainland, it is forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane by early next week. A hurricane watch is currently in effect for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates remaining attractive, financial planners are advising on how much cash to allocate to these accounts, especially as the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts that could lower future yields. Experts suggest placing 10% to 30% of cash savings into CDs, but emphasize that the exact amount depends on individual financial goals, emergency fund stability, and liquidity needs. They also recommend strategies like CD laddering—splitting deposits into accounts with different maturity dates—to maintain access to cash while capturing strong short-term rates. A key consideration is ensuring a robust emergency fund of three to six months' expenses is secured first. (not investment advice)</p>

Administration officials argue that when federal funds contribute to a company's success, the government should share in the financial upside. Quantum computing is viewed as a critical technology for future economic and national security, particularly in the context of technological competition with China. (not investment advice)</p>

The book alleges that Kristi Noem was chosen as homeland security secretary as a favor to former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, despite being considered "obviously unqualified" by some close allies. The book details significant infighting and last-minute maneuvering behind the appointments, with nominees like Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth not undergoing the traditional vetting process.

The law increases the tax-free gain cap from $10 million to $15 million, lowers the required stock holding period from five to three years, and raises the asset cap for eligible businesses to $75 million. These changes mean more small businesses, particularly those structured as C corporations, can qualify for significant capital gains tax exclusions upon selling their company.

          <p>Rivian Automotive is planning to lay off more than 600 employees, which amounts to roughly 4% of its workforce, as it navigates an increasingly difficult market for electric vehicles. The company is facing challenges such as the elimination of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit, slower-than-expected consumer demand, and significant financial losses, including a $1.1 billion loss in the second quarter. Although Rivian's sales saw a year-over-year increase in the third quarter, it has narrowed its overall delivery forecast for 2025. The layoffs reflect a broader trend of EV makers adjusting to a more competitive and less subsidized market environment.</p>

Former agency officials warn that the combination of a larger population, a rise in community-based arrests of individuals with unknown health histories, and persistent medical staffing shortages creates a high-risk environment.

The Kremlin has reacted angrily to the new measures, with former President Dmitry Medvedev calling the sanctions an "act of war."
