          <p>Former President Donald Trump has endorsed both Karrin Taylor Robson and Rep. Andy Biggs in the Arizona governor's race after Biggs entered the contest unexpectedly. Trump initially endorsed Robson when she was the sole candidate, but decided to support Biggs as well. Both candidates have expressed gratitude for Trump's endorsement and pledged to focus on cutting taxes and strengthening border security. Arizona is currently led by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, with the general election scheduled for November 3, 2026.</p>

          <p>The IRS' Direct File program, which allows taxpayers to file for free, may be discontinued by the Trump administration, despite saving users an average of $160 in tax preparation fees. The program, launched during the Biden presidency, has faced criticism from private tax preparation companies like Intuit, which argues it's a waste of taxpayer money. Democratic lawmakers are urging Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and IRS acting commissioner Michael Faulkender to keep Direct File open, while the IRS undergoes a cost-cutting overhaul that could reduce its workforce by 40%.</p>

          <p>Gold prices declined after hitting a record high, as investors hoped for a de-escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks about potential de-escalation boosted the stock market. Despite the pullback, gold has rallied nearly 30% since the start of the year and has gained 8% since Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2. Gold is considered a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, with central banks adding to their gold reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

The company also faces increasing competition in China and lags in the robotaxi market. Tesla is expected to report a slight decline in year-over-year revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts warn that the system is already overburdened, with judges reviewing hundreds of cases annually, and the administration is pressuring judges to expedite case reviews.</p>

The order targets a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act by proposing changes to the treatment of small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines. The industry contends that the current discrepancy discourages investment in small-molecule drugs. The proposed change could increase Medicare prescription drug spending and lead to higher medication prices.</p>
