          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner in China, suggests that the country should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five to ten years. This recommendation considers the potential for a prolonged rivalry with the United States and the necessity of addressing deep-rooted structural issues within China's economy. Xu emphasized that a 4% GDP growth would be satisfactory if it leads to increased employment and controlled debt levels. This proposal contrasts with market estimates of approximately 4.5% annual growth from 2026-30. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in a Chinese military magazine proposes that Beijing could subdue Taiwan by disabling its critical infrastructure, leading to a system collapse and undermining the will to resist. The article identifies 30 to 40 "super critical" targets, including liquefied natural gas facilities, which were recently part of a People's Liberation Army drill. The tactic, described as "urban collapse warfare," aims to achieve maximum effect with minimal military cost, potentially cutting off electricity and water supplies for days. Taiwan's dependence on imported energy and vulnerability to natural disasters make it a suitable target for this approach.</p>

          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla are visiting Canada in a move seen as a show of support amidst rising tensions with the United States under President Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently won an election partly due to anti-Trump sentiment, invited the royal couple. King Charles will deliver the "Speech from the Throne" to Canada's Parliament, emphasizing Canada's sovereignty and rejecting potential U.S. takeover claims. The visit is intended to convey a message of solidarity with Canada, following calls from Trump for the country to become the 51st U.S. state.</p>

The government states the pause is to assess the current situation, with a Home Office source citing a lack of stable information for risk assessments.
