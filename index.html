          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is meeting with counterparts from several EU nations to advocate for a more stringent migration policy across the bloc. The summit, held at Germany's Zugspitze, will address deportations to third countries, external border security, and combating human trafficking, with plans to issue a joint "Zugspitze declaration." This meeting occurs as Germany conducted its second deportation flight of Afghan nationals since the Taliban's return to power. The event also coincides with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's first annual summer press conference, where he is expected to face questions on various domestic and international issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Environment Agency, England experienced a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents by water companies in 2024, reaching a record high of 2,801 total events. Of these, 75 were classified as causing "serious or persistent" harm to the environment and public health, a significant increase from the previous year. The data highlights a failure to meet pollution reduction targets, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water identified as the primary offenders. A Public Accounts Committee has condemned the situation as a "national disgrace," criticizing regulators for failing to prevent companies from acting unlawfully.</p>

          <h2>Hosepipe Ban Affects Over 1.4 Million People in South East England Amidst Water Shortages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 04:31:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South East Water has implemented a hosepipe and sprinkler ban for more than 1.4 million customers in Kent and Sussex due to record-high demand for drinking water. The restriction follows extended periods of warm, dry weather and several heatwaves that have strained the water supply. The company reported its highest-ever usage on June 30th, and the ban aims to preserve essential water supplies, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. This measure is part of a broader trend, with other water companies in the UK also imposing or planning similar restrictions as drought conditions persist.</p>

The initiative focuses on producing high-tech vessels, such as LNG carriers and dual-fuel container ships, which are projected to constitute 80% of the base's output. The government projects the industrial cluster will achieve a scale exceeding 120 billion yuan (US$16.71 billion) within three years.

          <p>The European Union has approved its 18th sanctions package against Russia, which includes lowering the price cap on Russian crude oil to further limit Moscow's war-funding revenues. The original cap, set by the G7 and EU, restricted access to Western shipping and insurance services for buyers paying above $60 per barrel. While the new price level has not been specified, EU leaders confirmed the adjustment as part of a broader effort to target Russia's banking, energy, and military-industrial sectors. The new measures also notably sanction a major Russian-owned oil refinery located in India for the first time.</p>

          <p>Tom Lynagh, son of Australian rugby legend Michael Lynagh, is set to start at fly-half for Australia against the British and Irish Lions, marking a pivotal moment in his young career. The article traces his journey from his school days in London, where he played for Harlequins, to his difficult decision at age 17 to move to Australia and join the Queensland Reds. This move effectively committed him to pursuing a career with the Wallabies over potential opportunities with England or Italy. Coaches and mentors praise not only his natural talent and skill but also his tough, composed character, which has enabled him to thrive under pressure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, primarily targeting foreign assistance programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The measure, which passed by a narrow 216-213 vote, now heads to President Trump for his signature. The vote was delayed for hours due to procedural debates related to demands for the release of documents concerning the Jeffrey Epstein case. The package claws back roughly $8 billion from foreign aid, including USAID, and about $1 billion from public media, which supports NPR and PBS stations nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has requested that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department provide lists of all non-U.S. citizens in its jails, including their crimes and release dates. L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna stated that his agency cannot comply with the request because it does not ask for inmates' immigration status, and California's sanctuary laws prohibit sharing such information with federal immigration agents without a warrant. Luna described receiving "threatening letters" from the federal government over the issue. The request is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to increase immigration enforcement, creating a standoff between federal and local authorities.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Martin Hemmings has publicly accused Raynor Winn, the best-selling author of "The Salt Path," of stealing approximately £64,000 from their business in the early 2000s. They claim that trusting Winn, who worked as their bookkeeper, was their "biggest mistake." This allegation follows an investigation that challenged the narrative in Winn's memoir, suggesting the loss of her home was linked to repaying this money, not a failed business deal as depicted. Winn has acknowledged making "mistakes" and reaching a private settlement but maintains the book's account of how she became homeless is accurate.</p>

          <p>Syrian government forces have largely withdrawn from the southern province of Sweida following a U.S. and Turkey-mediated ceasefire, ending days of intense clashes with local Druze militias. The conflict, which killed nearly 600 people, had escalated significantly, drawing in Israeli airstrikes in defense of the Druze community. Under the new truce, Druze factions and clerics will now be responsible for maintaining internal security in the region. The withdrawal follows reports of revenge attacks and field executions during the fighting, highlighting the deep sectarian tensions that threaten Syria's fragile post-war transition.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that in 2003, Donald Trump sent a vulgar birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein, which included a hand-drawn sketch of a naked woman. The letter was allegedly part of a collection compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday and was reviewed by the Justice Department during its investigation. President Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling the story "fake" and stating, "These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures." He has subsequently threatened to sue the newspaper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, for publishing the story.</p>

          <p>HMP Pentonville in London has been put into special measures after an inspection revealed it was illegally detaining inmates past their release dates due to inaccurate sentence calculations. A report by the chief inspector of prisons found that 20% of eligible inmates had been held too long in the past six months. The prison was described as having "frightening conditions," including a widespread infestation of cockroaches and mice, severe overcrowding, and chaotic procedures for new arrivals. Inspectors also found "shockingly poor" oversight of prisoners under suicide watch, a major concern given three recent suicides at the facility.</p>

The move is seen as an attempt to quell outrage within his base following a recent Justice Department memo that concluded there was no "client list." Bondi confirmed she would move to unseal the transcripts, though such a release is legally complex.</p>

          <p>Russia is experiencing widespread and frequent mobile internet shutdowns across dozens of regions, a measure officials claim is necessary to counter Ukrainian drone attacks. The disruptions, which began in May but have since expanded nationwide, are causing significant problems for daily life, affecting electronic payments, ride-sharing apps, and navigation. While the Kremlin justifies the shutdowns on security grounds, digital rights experts warn the measures are an unprecedented expansion of state control over the internet. They fear it legitimizes such restrictions and could be abused to further curtail online freedom in a country where it is already heavily suppressed.</p>

In a televised address, Lula called the move a grave attack on Brazil's national sovereignty and labeled Brazilian politicians who support Trump as "traitors." This diplomatic dispute escalates tensions between the two largest economies in the Americas, with Lula insisting on the independence of Brazil's judiciary.</p>

The index, which measures the extent of market-based activity in the economy, fell in 2023, with the sub-index for government-market relations showing the most significant deterioration since 2019. Researchers pointed to this as a "pretty significant change" and urged action to reverse the trend of increased government intervention.
