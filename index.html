          <p>Payton Gendron, convicted of the 2022 Buffalo mass shooting, is seeking a change of venue for his federal trial. His lawyers argue that extensive pretrial publicity and the case's impact on Buffalo's communities of color prevent a fair trial in Western New York.  They propose moving the trial to New York City for a more impartial jury selection process. Gendron faces a potential death penalty if convicted on federal charges.</p>
