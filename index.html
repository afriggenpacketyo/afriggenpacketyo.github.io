          <h2>Ex-Fyre Fest Designer Highlights Common Traits Among Notorious Scammers</h2>

          <p>Oren Aks, former social media designer for Fyre Festival, argues that social media glorifies scammers like Billy McFarland and Anna Delvey, turning them into icons rather than focusing on their harmful actions. Aks believes this societal shift is worrying, as it normalizes and even celebrates unethical behavior. He also reflected on his experience with the original Fyre Festival, noting the warning signs that were apparent before the event's disastrous execution, including logistical failures and unfulfilled promises of luxury. Aks witnessed firsthand the festival's descent into chaos, highlighting the stark contrast between the promised experience and the reality of a poorly-equipped campsite.</p>

          <p>The United States is in talks with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to establish a "minerals-for-security" agreement, aiming to secure access to the DRC's vast mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees and military support. This deal could challenge China's dominance in the region's mining industry, as the DRC seeks to reduce its reliance on Chinese investment. The arrangement would involve the US using diplomatic and economic tools to broker peace in the DRC in exchange for critical minerals, potentially opening a new front in competition with China for resources in Africa.</p>

          <p>A large explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Iran has resulted in at least 25 deaths and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage and prompting the closure of schools and offices in the area. The blast, which occurred in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot, was likely caused by a fire that spread to unsealed containers of flammable materials. Some reports suggest the containers held solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, with previous shipments of rocket fuel arriving at the port from China. Officials had issued prior warnings about the safe storage of chemicals at the port.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is considering investing in a potential buyout of Toyota Industries, a key parts supplier, in a deal that could be valued at $42 billion. The move comes amid increasing shareholder pressure on Toyota Industries to unwind its cross-shareholdings to boost shareholder returns and investments. Going private would also give Toyota Industries the freedom to focus on growth strategies without being as concerned about shareholder returns. Toyota currently owns 24% of Toyota Industries, while Toyota Industries holds shares in Toyota and Denso, another key supplier.</p>

Text messages uncovered a passionate relationship between Brian and another woman, Cori Knowles. This affair, combined with the forensic evidence, led investigators to suspect Brian of murdering his wife.</p>

          <p>A peace proposal from the Trump administration, suggesting Ukraine recognize Russian authority over Crimea, has been met with shock and rejection by Ukrainian officials. They insist they will not formally surrender the peninsula, even if they concede it temporarily. Such a surrender is considered politically and legally impossible, requiring constitutional changes and a nationwide vote, and potentially viewed as treason. While Ukrainians understand some land may be ceded for an armistice, a formal surrender of Crimea is a red line.</p>

However, the effort appears less about de-escalation and more about building a case for potential military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of having ties to the attack. Despite Pakistan's denial, Indian officials are presenting evidence of Pakistan's past support for terrorist groups and referencing technical intelligence linking the perpetrators to Pakistan, though without officially identifying any specific group responsible.</p>
