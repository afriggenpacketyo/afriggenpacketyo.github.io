        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, stated that the company sees no immediate signs of a U.S. recession, despite the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on oil demand. Wirth acknowledged that growth may be slowing, but Chevron is not altering its capital spending plans in response to recent price drops. He noted that U.S. onshore oil production, particularly in the Permian Basin, could decrease if prices fall to $60 per barrel, while offshore production would likely remain unaffected. The CEO also mentioned that Chevron expects minimal direct impact from tariffs, with macroeconomic effects being the primary concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts slower U.S. economic growth in 2025, primarily due to the escalating trade war and high policy uncertainty. The IMF projects a growth rate of 1.8% for this year, a decrease from previous estimates, and anticipates U.S. inflation to rise to around 3% by year's end. The agency has also increased the probability of a U.S. recession to 37% and warns that further escalation of the trade war could hinder both short-term and long-term economic growth. These projections were finalized shortly after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. ports, particularly Los Angeles and Long Beach, are experiencing a steep decline in container vessel traffic from China due to President Trump's tariffs and recession concerns. Data indicates a 29% week-over-week decrease in freight vessels leaving China for Southern California ports, with a 44% year-over-year drop expected for the week of May 4-May 10. This slowdown in ocean freight is impacting ground transport, leading to a significant reduction in available truck loads on the West Coast. The drop in freight is a tangible sign of the trade tensions impacting the US economy.</p>

          <p>Arwa Mahdawi, a half-Palestinian lesbian freelance writer, humorously outlines a six-point plan to become a Republican congresswoman in the current political climate. The satirical plan includes becoming a billionaire, selling one's soul to a billionaire, achieving notoriety through trolling, harnessing AI technology, sharing top-secret plans in group chats, and ultimately increasing one's net worth. The piece is a commentary on the perceived state of modern American politics, where traditional qualifications are seemingly less important than wealth, notoriety, and allegiance to powerful figures.</p>

          <p>A new ceasefire plan for the Israel-Gaza conflict has been proposed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, aiming for a truce lasting five to seven years. The plan includes the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity. While it is too early to assess its likelihood of success, the mediation effort is described as serious, with Hamas showing "unprecedented flexibility."</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesman stated that Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman as a biological female under equalities law. This clarification follows previous statements where Starmer expressed support for trans women's rights. The ruling clarifies that a person born male but identifying as a woman does not have the right to use women-only spaces or services. The shift highlights ongoing debate surrounding transgender rights and single-sex spaces.</p>

          <p>The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan has stepped aside, allowing President Trump to install his nominee, Jay Clayton, as interim United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. This marks another change in leadership for the prominent prosecutor's office. Matthew Podolsky, who has agreed to step down, took over for Danielle Sassoon, who resigned in protest of the Justice Department's order to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. Clayton's appointment is likely to face opposition in the Senate.</p>
