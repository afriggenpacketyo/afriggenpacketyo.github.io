          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:33:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a significant reduction-in-force, laying off over 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a broader reorganization plan. This move, which aims to cut the domestic workforce by about 15%, is part of a larger plan that will see nearly 3,000 staff depart in total, including those who accepted voluntary buyouts. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the cuts are indiscriminate and could undermine national security by weakening the department's ability to conduct diplomacy. The administration defends the changes as necessary to streamline a bloated bureaucracy and increase efficiency.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:32:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing integration of generative AI in the corporate world is creating new difficulties for recent college graduates seeking entry-level positions. Data indicates a 15% decline in such job listings, while applications per job have surged, and the unemployment rate for young degree holders is notably higher than the national average. Experts suggest AI is absorbing many rote tasks traditionally assigned to new hires, forcing a redefinition of entry-level roles to require AI-related skills. This trend may also shift career paths, potentially pushing more young people toward skilled trades that are less susceptible to AI automation.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the summer, with temperatures soaring and prompting amber heat health alerts across southern and eastern England. The extreme heat has led to the hottest day of the year in Wales and has exacerbated drought conditions, with over seven million people now under hosepipe bans to conserve low water levels. The Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in northwest England and Yorkshire. Authorities are urging the public to take precautions, stay hydrated, and be aware of increased wildfire risks.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez admitted to running a significant fentanyl trafficking operation for the Sinaloa cartel's "Los Chapitos" faction. The deal requires him to provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could potentially lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. He is the first of El Chapo's sons to reach a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil lawsuit alleging that prominent Georgia Republican Brant Frost IV orchestrated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded about 300 investors of at least $140 million. The complaint claims Frost's company, First Liberty Building and Loan, lied about its business of making high-interest loans and instead used new investor funds to pay earlier ones. Frost is accused of personally misappropriating over $19 million for personal expenses, including luxury items and political contributions, while his business was collapsing. The company has since ceased operations, leaving investors with significant losses. (not investment advice)</p>

The price momentum also triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend.

UEFA rules prevent two clubs with the same influential owner from competing in the same tournament, and Lyon was given precedence.

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has asked some laid-off staff if they could return to work temporarily, as the department grapples with a backlog of grants that has swelled to more than a billion dollars in the wake of hurdles set up by DOGE. Multiple HHS officials, who were not authorized to speak to the press, said the laid-off staff asked to return to work include a handful of employees who managed grants in the department's Administration for Children and Families, or ACF. Around half of ACF's grants management staff have been laid off or left under the Trump administration, one official said.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting the agency to ask some recently laid-off employees to return to work temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic review processes implemented by the Trump administration under an initiative called DOGE, which have stalled the awarding of funds. The backlog affects critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and domestic violence hotlines. With the fiscal year ending soon, there are concerns that the compressed timeline will make it nearly impossible to process the grants properly.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's future solvency and recent overpayment issues, seniors may need to find alternative ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines several potential financial strategies for homeowners and those with savings. Options discussed include taking out a reverse mortgage, which provides payments from home equity without immediate repayment, and purchasing an annuity to guarantee a lifelong income stream. For more immediate needs, a personal loan is presented as a possibility, though it involves taking on new debt at relatively high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to quickly tap into their home equity, this article details several methods to expedite the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Strategies include applying with fully online lenders who use digital platforms to speed up verification and appraisals, or working with the lender that already holds your primary mortgage. Other options are seeking "low-doc" or "no-doc" HELOCs that minimize paperwork, or choosing lenders that use faster, automated appraisal methods. The article notes that while these approaches can provide funds faster, they may come with trade-offs like higher rates or stricter eligibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This season of the popular reality show "Love Island USA" is notable for its lack of deep romantic connections, which this analysis from The Atlantic argues is a reflection of Gen Z's dating culture. The cast, many of whom were in high school during the pandemic, appear emotionally guarded, inexperienced in relationships, and hesitant to show vulnerability, leading to a season of "situationships" rather than love stories. The article suggests this behavior mirrors broader trends among young adults who are anxious about romance and avoid directness. Despite this, the show's most popular contestants are those who express their feelings openly.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, explicitly linking the move to the ongoing criminal trial of Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. In a social media post, Trump called the prosecution a "witch hunt" and demanded that authorities "leave Bolsonaro alone." The threat has sparked outrage in Brazil, with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government condemning it as an unacceptable attempt to interfere in the country's sovereign judicial process. This use of trade policy as leverage in another nation's domestic legal affairs marks a significant escalation of Trump's tariff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' delivers a temporary higher limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. But the phaseout, or income-based benefit reduction, could trigger a tax surprise for some higher earners, experts say. The legislation raises the SALT deduction limit to $40,000 starting in 2025 but phases it out for incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. This structure can create a "SALT torpedo"—an artificially high tax rate—where some individuals could pay a 45.5% federal tax rate on earnings within that specific income bracket, surprising many filers.

This rapid reduction of the deduction as income rises creates a "SALT torpedo," where each additional dollar earned in that range is effectively taxed at a much higher rate, potentially as high as 45.5% in some scenarios.

          <p>The United States is currently experiencing its most severe measles outbreak in 33 years, with over 1,290 cases confirmed in 2025, surpassing the total for any year since 1992. Public health experts are concerned that the summer travel season will further accelerate the spread of the highly contagious disease. The resurgence is attributed to declining vaccination rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted routine immunizations and amplified anti-vaccine sentiment. Officials are urging the public to ensure their MMR vaccinations are up-to-date as the best defense against the potentially serious illness.</p>
