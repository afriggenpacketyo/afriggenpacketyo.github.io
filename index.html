        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freshers' flu, an assortment of common cold viruses, is prevalent among new university students due to factors like close living quarters, late nights, poor diet, and stress, which collectively suppress the immune system. Immunologists explain that students are exposed to a cocktail of novel respiratory viruses, and their compromised immunity makes them highly susceptible to prolonged symptoms that often feel worse than a typical cold. While generally not serious, the illness can significantly impact academic performance and social life, underscoring the critical importance of rest and healthy habits even amidst the intense social pressures of freshers' week. Students are advised to seek medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, to rule out more serious bacterial infections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge, Deborah Boardman, appointed by President Biden, has drawn significant conservative criticism for sentencing Nicholas Roske to eight years in prison for attempting to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This sentence is notably lower than the 30 years sought by the Department of Justice, with the judge citing mitigating factors such as Roske's spontaneous confession and cooperation with police. Conservatives on social media and Attorney General Pam Bondi have strongly condemned the decision, with Bondi announcing plans to appeal. The controversy raises serious concerns about the perceived leniency and the judicial system's handling of high-profile cases, further fueling political polarization.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is sending 300 National Guardsmen to Chicago, despite repeated rejections from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, escalating tensions between federal and local authorities. This deployment follows an incident where federal law enforcement shot an armed individual during an alleged confrontation with vehicles near an ICE facility. Governor Pritzker criticized the move as a 'manufactured performance' for political gain, while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem framed it as enforcing laws and bolstering public safety. The article highlights ongoing clashes over immigration enforcement and federal intervention in Democratic-run cities, deepening the political divide and local resistance.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports commentator Mark Sanchez was arrested for battery with injury, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle, and public intoxication after being stabbed late Friday night in downtown Indianapolis. Police responded to a disturbance where Sanchez and another person were injured, with Sanchez initially taken to a hospital in critical condition. The circumstances surrounding the attack remain unclear, and he is currently hospitalized. The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office will make the final charging decision, as Sanchez was in Indianapolis to call a football game, adding an unexpected turn to his professional commitments.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel is 'on the verge of a very great achievement,' expressing hope to announce the return of all hostages from Gaza 'in the coming days' under a proposed peace plan. President Trump also affirmed Israel's agreement to an initial withdrawal line and warned Hamas to act quickly or face consequences. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to begin in Egypt, with a senior Israeli official indicating a halt in IDF offensive activity is meant to allow Hamas to organize hostage releases. The situation remains delicate, balancing hopes for peace with underlying military and political complexities.</p>

          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters attempting to storm the presidential palace, escalating the country's political crisis. The protests follow the ruling Georgian Dream party's disputed election victory last year and its decision to pause talks on joining the EU, which the pro-European opposition claims was stolen. Demonstrators, many wearing masks to avoid identification by surveillance cameras, are demanding the release of political prisoners and snap parliamentary elections. This article highlights the deep divisions between urban and rural populations regarding the government's perceived pro-Russian leanings, fueling ongoing unrest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred unaccompanied immigrant children to adult detention centers upon turning 18. The ruling states that automatically detaining these individuals violates a 2021 court order requiring release to the 'least restrictive setting available.' This adds to ongoing legal challenges against Trump's controversial immigration policies, which also include accusations of reviving family separations and offering $2,500 for children to self-deport. Advocates warn these policies pressure vulnerable children to abandon legal claims and return to dangerous situations, raising significant human rights concerns.</p>

Her personal experiences inform policy proposals on women's health and caregiving, while her political career has seen her serve in senior government roles and build a reputation as an outspoken conservative voice.

Protesters, many crediting Trump for the progress, voiced their fervent desire for the return of hostages held since October 7, 2023, and for a return to normalcy. The U.S. plan includes a hostage-for-prisoner exchange, phased Israeli withdrawal, and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza. Despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's claims of military success leading to Hamas's shift, many protesters distrust his motives, fearing he might sabotage the deal to remain in power, reflecting deep societal divisions.</p>
