          <p>Global food corporation Nestlé has dismissed its CEO, Laurent Freixe, after only a year in the role. The termination was immediate following an internal investigation, prompted by a whistleblower, which found he had violated the company's code of conduct by failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The company emphasized that its values and governance are foundational and has appointed Philipp Navratil, a long-time executive, as the new CEO to ensure strategic continuity and maintain performance momentum. This decision mirrors actions taken by other major corporations like BP and McDonald's in similar circumstances involving executive conduct.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Nevada are conducting a homicide investigation after a man was found dead at the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City on Saturday night. The victim, described as a white male between 35 and 40, was discovered "lying in a pool of blood" as the event's signature effigy was being burned. The Pershing County Sheriff's Office has cordoned off the area and is appealing to the public for any information regarding the incident, which they believe was a singular crime. Festival organizers are cooperating with law enforcement and have urged attendees to remain vigilant.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has strengthened its defense by signing Ecuadorian international Piero Hincapie on a season-long loan from German club Bayer Leverkusen. The deal includes a £45 million option for a permanent transfer next summer, making Hincapie the eighth signing for the club during the current transfer window. Manager Mikel Arteta praised the 23-year-old's physical presence and versatility, which will add depth to the squad's defensive options. The move coincides with the departure of defender Jakub Kiwior to Porto and midfielders Fabio Vieira and Sambi Lokonga to Hamburg, as Arsenal reshapes its team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi has collapsed on the final day of the transfer window, despite an agreement on a fee of at least £35 million. The deal fell through because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement for their captain before the deadline, even after signing another defender earlier in the day. This development is a setback for Liverpool, who were seeking to reinforce their defense following some early-season vulnerabilities. Guehi had been a key target for the Premier League champions this summer.</p>

          <p>Oman has become the latest Gulf nation to launch a "golden visa" program, aiming to attract wealthy foreign investors, including Americans seeking international residency. To qualify for the Golden Residency, individuals must invest at least $520,000 in Omani property, bonds, or businesses that create local jobs. The program offers benefits like fast-track airport services and the ability to own property in previously restricted areas. This move is part of a broader trend where countries use investment-based residency to stimulate economic growth, with experts noting a rising demand for such programs as a form of security and mobility.

          <p>The new film "The Smashing Machine," directed by Benny Safdie, stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and relationship issues. Johnson's performance is noted as a powerful and fitting casting choice, capturing the vulnerability of the formidable fighter. While the film is praised for its solid drama and insightful moments, particularly in scenes with co-star Emily Blunt, some critics feel it doesn't fully explore its emotional depths.</p>

The victim's mother, Linda Westcarr, condemned the sentence for lacking any punitive element and called for an urgent review.

          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the United States has dropped by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year. This decline coincides with the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, which have slowed the flow of new immigrants and increased deportations. Economists note that immigrants constitute a significant portion of the workforce in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and services. The reduction in this labor pool could exacerbate labor shortages and impact economic growth, particularly in states and industries heavily reliant on foreign workers. (not investment advice)</p>

This article clarifies that these allegations, which originated in 2016, lack credible evidence. Melania Trump previously sued the Daily Mail and a blogger for defamation over the escort claim, resulting in retractions, apologies, and financial settlements. Furthermore, multiple reports confirm the Trumps were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli, not at an event connected to Jeffrey Epstein or Maxwell.

The single side-by-side vehicle, carrying nine people, reportedly struck another ATV, overturned, and hit a tree. Authorities confirmed that none of the occupants were wearing safety restraints or harnesses. The deceased were identified as the father of all seven children and the mother of three of them. Officials highlighted the remote location of the crash, which complicated rescue efforts, and stressed the critical importance of adhering to safety protocols when operating recreational vehicles.</p>

In the health-care sector, shares of Novo Nordisk also rose following the release of favorable trial data for its weight-loss drug Wegovy, suggesting superior performance in reducing heart disease risk compared to a key rival. This corporate news helped lift market sentiment, while investors also assessed mixed manufacturing data from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism over her past property dealings. The controversy centers on allegations that she may have avoided paying the proper amount of tax on the purchase of a flat in Hove by misrepresenting her primary residence. While there is no suggestion of illegal activity, the Conservative party has accused her of hypocrisy and called for an investigation. Starmer defended Rayner as a "great story of British success" from a humble background and dismissed the criticism as a mistake, stating he was "proud" of his deputy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated species. Researchers from the University of Montpellier discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild animals like deer and foxes became smaller due to habitat loss and pressure. In contrast, domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger as humans exerted more control through selective breeding and specialized management. The findings illustrate the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

          <p>The enthusiastic fanbase for the popular romance series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has taken a toxic turn, prompting the show's network, Prime Video, to intervene. Viewers, passionately divided into "teams" supporting one of the two main love interests, have begun directing hostility and threats towards the show's actors. In response, Prime Video launched a social media campaign urging fans to "keep the conversation kind" and reminding them of the line between fiction and reality. A psychiatrist weighs in, suggesting this behavior is a sign of parasocial relationships, where one-sided bonds with media figures become blurred with reality, exacerbated by online anonymity.</p>

          <p>During the redevelopment of a former Debenhams department store into a university campus in Gloucester, UK, archaeologists have discovered 317 skeletons from medieval and post-medieval burial grounds. The find is part of a larger excavation that has also unearthed numerous Roman-era artifacts, including pottery and building foundations, as the site was once part of an ancient Roman town. The skeletons were found near the location of the former St. Aldate's Church. While the human remains will be reinterred after study, other artifacts will be displayed at the new University of Gloucester campus when it opens.</p>

Ukraine's national police chief stated there is a "Russian trace" in the crime, alleging it was not accidental. The killing of the high-profile politician, who has been a vocal supporter of Ukrainian independence, is seen by Kyiv as another instance of Russian-backed political violence since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned rail operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during traditional rush hours. The move is a response to post-pandemic travel patterns, which have seen a reduction in commuter congestion, providing enough capacity to handle demand without price differentiation. While passengers welcome the cheaper tickets, the initiative raises questions about whether the rest of the UK could follow suit. Experts are divided, with some warning that without sufficient capacity, eliminating peak fares in busier English networks could lead to overcrowding or overall price increases to offset lost revenue.</p>

He ultimately resigned from Parliament after admitting to cocaine use, triggering a by-election for his seat.
