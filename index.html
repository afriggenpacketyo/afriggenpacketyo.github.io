          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, was forced to return to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas after flames and smoke were observed coming from one of its engines shortly after takeoff.

A subsequent inspection by the airline's maintenance team found no evidence of a fire, but the Airbus A321 was taken out of service for further evaluation, and the FAA is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly called for the cancellation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing corruption trial, describing it as a "witch hunt". Trump, who himself has faced numerous legal challenges, voiced his support for Netanyahu, praising his strength and love for Israel, particularly during recent conflicts with Iran. Netanyahu is facing charges of fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in three separate cases, allegations he denies, claiming they are politically motivated. Trump also suggested a pardon for Netanyahu, calling him a "great hero."</p>

New satellite images show craters clustered around entry points at Fordo and Isfahan, but the extent of damage to underground facilities remains unclear.

          <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the U.S. will halt funding to Gavi, the international vaccine alliance, citing concerns over vaccine safety. Kennedy made these remarks at a Gavi pledging summit, criticizing the group for allegedly ignoring science on vaccine safety and urging them to "re-earn the public trust" before the U.S. would reconsider funding. Gavi has rejected these accusations, emphasizing its commitment to the safety and health of children and adherence to WHO recommendations. The U.S. has been a major donor to Gavi, funding about 13% of its budget.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gas prices in California are projected to increase in July due to a state sales tax hike and stricter regulations on refineries aimed at promoting lower-carbon fuels. The combined effect of these factors could raise gas prices by nearly 70 cents per gallon, although experts are hesitant to provide an exact estimate. Despite a recent decrease in fuel prices due to oil supply outweighing demand, California consumers are unlikely to experience continued relief. The state's gas and diesel excise tax will increase, and amendments to the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program will add compliance costs for gasoline producers.</p>
