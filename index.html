          <p>Ukraine reported that Russia launched its largest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began, with 273 drones targeting several regions, including Kyiv, where one woman died. The attack occurred just before a scheduled call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, who the US President has been urging for a ceasefire. Ukraine's air force claimed to have intercepted 88 drones, while another 128 went astray without causing damage. Germany's Chancellor said he and leaders of the UK, France, and Poland would have a virtual meeting with Trump before his conversation with Putin on Monday morning.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic moves in the Middle East signal a shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Israel playing a less central role. During a five-day tour, Trump engaged in peace deals in Iran and Yemen and pursued business deals with Gulf nations, without stopping in Israel. This has raised concerns about the U.S. sidelining Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, particularly regarding the war in Gaza. The article suggests Trump is prioritizing relationships with Gulf States, and is seeking to negotiate peace deals in Iran and Yemen and cut trillion-dollar business deals with the wealthy nations of the Persian Gulf.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s chief Iran negotiator, stated that any deal with Iran must include an agreement not to enrich uranium. Witkoff emphasized that the U.S. cannot allow even 1% of enrichment capability, as it enables weaponization. This statement drew criticism from Tehran, with Iranian officials asserting that enrichment is a non-negotiable right. Despite the disagreement, Witkoff expressed optimism about future talks in Europe. The envoy is looking for a middle ground, and it is not clear what that compromise might be.</p>

          <p>Retired General Stanley McChrystal discusses the importance of character in American society and leadership. He argues that national leaders are a symptom, not the cause, of a decline in character, attributing the issue to individual unwillingness to demand and value character. McChrystal emphasizes the need for a national conversation on character starting at the grassroots level, rather than at the top. While acknowledging his endorsement of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the last election, he defends his decision as a stand for American values, rather than a purely political act.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece discusses the identity crisis in country music, torn between Nashville's manufactured sound and the genre's recent diversification with Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and queer artists. The author argues that outsiders entering the genre must choose between reactionary whiteness or reparative multiracialism, highlighting artists like Jelly Roll, Morgan Wallen, and Zach Top as examples of industry-anointed white saviors. The piece also celebrates the rise of Black country artists and criticizes Nashville's aesthetic codes that exclude non-white performers, noting that Black audiences across the nation will pay for country music that reflects their cultural sensibilities.</p>

          <p>Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, has been identified as the suspect in the bombing of a fertility clinic in Palm Springs. Bartkus, a resident of Twentynine Palms, reportedly held anti-natalist views and opposed in vitro fertilization (IVF). The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, with evidence suggesting the bomber tried to record or stream the explosion. The blast damaged the American Reproductive Centers, but the facility said it would be fully operational on Monday.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that Walmart may pass along some of the costs from President Trump’s tariffs to shoppers through higher prices. Bessent claimed that Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, assured him that the company would absorb some of the tariffs, but this was contradicted by the company's earlier statement that they could not fully absorb the costs. The president’s strategy, which he insisted would lead to negotiations and trade deals with at least 150 countries, was variously ridiculed and condemned as flawed and unworkable. Bessent told CNN’s State of the Union in a later appearance on Sunday that the US was focused on its “18 most important trading relationships” – and that he expected trade talks to continue with a number of countries leading to a series of regional deals.</p>

A Greek government official said the ship had maneuvered in Russian waters to avoid shallows and that the Russians had intercepted it and moved it to a safe place to impose a fine.

Nike had hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.

The closing laps were compelling viewing, with the field alternating position between drivers on old tyres and those on fresh. Hamilton finished just 1.4 seconds behind Piastri at the flag.</p>
