          <p>The Democratic Party faces significant challenges in adapting to a new political era marked by widespread social distrust and a conviction that societal systems are rigged. The Republican Party, under President Trump, has been more effective in adjusting to this shift by capitalizing on public alienation. The Democrats must undergo a fundamental transformation to address these challenges, requiring visionaries and a willingness to shift their entire worldview. This article suggests that the Democrats' problems are more profound than just needing a new message or leader.</p>
