          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the former vice presidential nominee, delivered a pointed commencement speech at the University of Minnesota's law school, accusing President Trump of repeatedly violating the rule of law and creating a national emergency. Walz urged the graduates to stand up to abuses of power, citing Trump's immigration crackdown and questions about due process. He argued that lawyers are the first and last line of defense against tyranny, calling on them to uphold their oath in the face of what he described as a genuine emergency. Walz is among a number of potential 2028 candidates who have been traveling to early voting states. </p>

          <p>Federal courts are increasingly resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. The courts are insisting that immigrants have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, especially as Trump officials claim novel and extraordinary powers to remove them. Cases concerning the Alien Enemies Act, passed in 1798, have highlighted the need for due process, with judges ruling that immigrants must have the ability to contest their deportations before being removed. </p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria took U.S. sanctions officials by surprise, creating confusion within the Treasury Department. The announcement lacked specifics, leading to discussions about the speed and extent of the rollback. The decision follows months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government for sanctions relief. Some of the most punitive measures were imposed on the former Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for terrorist groups. </p>

Hobbs, considered one of the nation's most vulnerable Democratic governors, is likely to face a formidable Republican opponent in a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats. The state party is also dealing with infighting, which is creating unwanted distractions as Hobbs prepares for a tough re-election fight. The party needs to unite to help Hobbs secure her seat. </p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have engaged in a new round of talks to end the war in Gaza, after Israel launched a major new offensive called "Operation Gideon's Chariots". The new round of talks comes after a week of intensifying bombardments and airstrikes, with at least 300 people killed in Israeli strikes on the enclave since Thursday. Taher al-Nounou, an adviser to the head of Hamas, told the BBC fresh negotiations were under way in Doha that were being brokered by Qatari and US mediators. The intensified offensive has been condemned by the UN and some European leaders. </p>
