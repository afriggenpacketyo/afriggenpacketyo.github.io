          <p>Technology stocks experienced a volatile trading session following President Trump's unwavering support for global tariffs, triggering concerns about their impact on the sector. Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla faced declines, with Apple particularly affected, while Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia saw gains. The tech sector's recent struggles include the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively losing over $1.8 trillion in market value and the Nasdaq Composite entering a bear market, marking its worst week since the Covid-19 pandemic's onset. This volatility underscores the market's sensitivity to trade policy and its potential repercussions on major tech players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed inconsistencies in the White House's messaging regarding tariffs during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He stated that tariffs could be both permanent and negotiable, emphasizing the pursuit of fair deals with all countries. Trump asserted that nations unwilling to negotiate fair deals would be excluded from participating in the United States. This stance highlights the administration's dual approach of using tariffs as a tool for both economic pressure and negotiation, aiming to reshape trade relationships globally.</p>

Garcia, who had protected legal status, was sent to a high-security prison in El Salvador due to an administrative error.

          <p>Abtisam Mohamed, a British MP, asserted that the Israeli government denied her entry into the country due to censorship and control. Mohamed and another MP were detained at the airport before being sent back to the UK. The Israeli government stated that the MPs had 'accused Israel of false claims' and were 'actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers.' The incident raises concerns about freedom of expression and the treatment of democratically elected officials.</p>

          <p>As bonds regain popularity in the market, investors are shifting towards actively managed bond strategies, unlike the trend with stock ETFs. Swift changes in treasury bond yields amid the Fed's inflation fight were part of the reason that a more active hand in bonds worked well in 2024. The 'uninvestable' nature of the core bond index has made active managers the investor favorite, allowing them to deviate from the outdated AGG. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) is ending partnerships with the federal government for refugee and children's services due to funding cuts. The decision follows the Trump administration’s halt of funding for refugee resettlement, leading to fewer services for those in need. The bishops sued the Trump administration over the funding halt, but a judge ruled against them. This decision highlights the impact of government policies on faith-based organizations providing social services.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Trump at the White House to discuss the war in Gaza, Iran's nuclear threat, and U.S. tariffs. Trump greeted Netanyahu with a handshake, but the White House canceled a scheduled press conference. The meeting is the first effort by a foreign leader to negotiate a deal after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs, including on Israeli goods. This underscores the complex relationship between the U.S. and Israel amidst global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices fell sharply due to fears that President Trump's global tariffs would push the U.S. and the world into a recession. U.S. crude oil fell to its lowest level since 2021, adding to last week's losses. Trump touted the steep fall in oil prices, but worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses and hurt demand for oil. This highlights the sensitivity of commodity markets to trade policy and economic uncertainty.</p>
