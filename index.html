          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 20:32:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, citing national security concerns and claiming these films are "messaging and propaganda." He has authorized the U.S. Trade Representative to begin implementing the levy, though specific details are lacking. The move follows China's earlier reduction of American movies allowed into that country, escalating trade tensions and potentially harming studios like Disney and Warner Bros already struggling after the pandemic. This decision could significantly impact the global film industry and further strain international trade relations.</p>

          <p>Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat from Texas, responded to President Trump's criticism of her intelligence by asserting that he is "terrified" of "smart, bold Black women" who hold him accountable. This exchange followed an interview where Trump voiced concerns about the Democratic Party's future, labeling Crockett as a "low IQ person." Crockett, known for her active social media presence and controversial statements, has faced criticism for remarks such as calling Texas Governor Greg Abbott "Governor Hot Wheels." Her response underscores the ongoing political tensions and the intersection of race and gender in political discourse.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to reopen and significantly expand Alcatraz, the former prison island near San Francisco, to house America's "most ruthless and violent Offenders." He stated that this move symbolizes law, order, and justice, directing the Bureau of Prisons and other federal agencies to undertake the project. Alcatraz, a maximum-security prison that closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, once housed infamous criminals like Al Capone. The National Park Service currently operates the island as a popular tourist site, raising questions about the feasibility of Trump's proposal.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's policies and persona are influencing elections worldwide. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties gained ground by campaigning against Trump-like conservative leaders. However, in other countries like Germany, the impact is more complex, with leaders leveraging Trump's policies to justify domestic actions. The article suggests that while there's no widespread anti-Trump wave, voters are considering Trump's influence when making decisions, and leaders are adapting their strategies accordingly. The article also discusses the exception of Britain, where the anti-immigration party is doing well.</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular, some experts caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution for delaying motherhood. The process is expensive, costing upwards of $12,000 per cycle, and doesn't ensure a successful pregnancy. Critics argue that companies offering egg freezing as a benefit may be prioritizing employee retention over women's reproductive autonomy. A better solution, they say, involves societal and corporate support for women to have children at younger ages. One woman's story is shared, which details a lack of success even after freezing 30 eggs.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity as a means for women to preserve their fertility, but experts warn against viewing it as a guaranteed solution.

The procedure provides options for women who want to delay motherhood due to career or personal reasons. Experts say more education about egg freezing and fertility is needed, and gynecologists should have these conversations with women when they're younger.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, best known for his role as the comically genteel sheriff Tom Brewster in the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94. The show, which premiered in 1957, featured Hutchins as a law student-turned-sheriff who favored sarsaparilla over whiskey and abhorred violence. After "Sugarfoot," Hutchins worked in other TV shows and films, and even spent time as a traveling clown. He is remembered for his wholesome portrayal of a Wild West figure and his later career as a shipping clerk at NBC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a significant drop after OPEC+ agreed to increase production in June, marking the second consecutive month of increased output. The decision, led by Saudi Arabia, led to concerns about an oversupplied market, contributing to a monthly loss in April. The situation is further complicated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, raising fears of a recession and slowing demand. Oilfield service firms are anticipating a decline in exploration and production investment due to the weak price environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh stated that the team's decision on whether to retain kicker Justin Tucker will be based on "football" factors, amidst sexual misconduct allegations against the NFL veteran. The team drafted Arizona kicker Tyler Loop, adding to the uncertainty. Tucker, considered one of the greatest kickers in NFL history, had a subpar season in 2024. Meanwhile, Ravens' second-round pick Mike Green declined to discuss allegations of sexual assault directed at him. The Ravens said they conducted their "due diligence" on Green.</p>

          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro, which drew approximately 2 million fans.

Authorities worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt the plan, treating it as a "collective challenge" for social media notoriety. Despite the alleged threat, Lady Gaga's team stated that there were no known safety concerns prior to or during the show, and they worked closely with law enforcement to ensure safety.</p>

Truex suggests that Trump's aggressive rhetoric and tariffs may be a bargaining tactic, but it doesn't appear that he is interested in resetting the relationship with China more broadly.</p>
