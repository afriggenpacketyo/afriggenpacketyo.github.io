          <p>Tensions flared between China and Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands after a Japanese civilian plane allegedly flew over the disputed territory. Chinese coastguards protested the 'illegal intrusion' and warned of countermeasures, while Japan countered with its own protest regarding Chinese coastguard ships entering its 'territorial waters' around the islands. This ongoing dispute remains a significant point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations, highlighting the countries' conflicting claims of sovereignty in the East China Sea. The situation underscores the potential for further escalation and the need for diplomatic efforts to manage the conflict. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the country's surname law, which mandates that couples share a last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, an organization advocating for separate surnames, indicates that this concern is particularly prevalent among people in their 20s, with approximately 40% citing it as a barrier. The Justice Ministry acknowledges that Japan is the only country, to its knowledge, that requires couples to adopt a single surname upon marriage. This issue continues to be a point of contention, with differing views among political parties regarding potential reforms.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating geopolitical tensions and trade wars between the US and China, wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their real estate investments away from the United States. Data indicates a shift in demand towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada for homes priced above US$5 million. This trend reflects concerns over protectionism, increased scrutiny of property deals, and a search for more welcoming investment environments. Chinese investment in US homes has significantly declined since its peak in 2017, as buyers seek friendlier alternatives.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. The move fulfills a campaign promise and represents a major victory for school choice advocates. The program will provide families with $10,000 per year, or up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, to cover private education costs. Critics argue that the program will drain resources from public schools and benefit wealthy families. Starting next school year, up to 90,000 students could be covered by the program, potentially costing up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president foreshadowed the structure of his second term. Klein contrasts Trump's first administration, characterized by uneasy alliances and internal checks, with his second, which he describes as a 'royal court' dominated by loyalists. The choice of Vance, who embraces MAGA ideology and rejects the certification of the 2020 election, signals a shift away from moderation and toward unchecked authority. Klein contends that this new structure eliminates dissenting voices and amplifies Trump's disinhibition, making his presidency more reckless and uncompromising.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's 'golden passport' scheme, ending the practice of selling EU citizenship in exchange for investments. The court deemed such schemes a 'mere commercial transaction' that undermines the solidarity and mutual trust among EU member states. While the ruling targets citizenship-for-investment programs, concerns remain about 'golden visas,' which offer residence permits for significant investments. Anti-corruption advocates hope the decision will lead to greater scrutiny and regulation of these residency-by-investment schemes, highlighting risks of money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption.</p>

The vote, tallied at 212 in favor and 6 against, formalizes the area surrounding SpaceX's rocket launch facility. While SpaceX has drawn support for its job creation and investment, concerns have been raised about Musk's potential control over the area, including the authority to close a local beach. The establishment of Starbase coincides with SpaceX's request to increase the number of South Texas launches, prompting debate over environmental impacts and public access.</p>

          <p>Kenyans are facing increased economic hardship due to rising payroll taxes implemented by President William Ruto's administration to address the country's debt crisis. These taxes, combined with new levies on various goods and services, have significantly reduced take-home pay for salaried workers. The situation is exacerbated by high poverty levels, youth unemployment, and widespread corruption. Public frustration is growing as essential services remain inadequate despite the increased tax burden. The government's efforts to secure a new loan package from the IMF are likely to require further austerity measures, potentially leading to more unrest.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, challenging the dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. The surge in support for Reform UK, along with gains for other smaller parties, signals a potential fragmentation of British politics. The Conservatives suffered considerable losses, while Labour also faced voter dissatisfaction. This shift presents a conundrum for both main parties as they navigate competing with opponents on their left and right. Political analysts suggest that Reform UK's rise could transform it from a protest party into a major political force.</p>

These challenges have raised questions about the KMT's ability to effectively hold the executive branch accountable.

The airline cited the FAA's inability to handle the current flight volume as the primary reason for the cuts.

The move is expected to alleviate delays and cancellations, but travelers are frustrated by the ongoing disruptions.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the country's surname law, which mandates that couples share a last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, an organization advocating for separate surnames, indicates that this concern is particularly prevalent among people in their 20s, with approximately 40% citing it as a barrier. The Justice Ministry acknowledges that Japan is the only country, to its knowledge, that requires couples to adopt a single surname upon marriage. This issue continues to be a point of contention, with differing views among political parties regarding potential reforms.</p>
