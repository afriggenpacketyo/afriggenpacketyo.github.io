          <p>A tight contest is unfolding at the Tour Championship, with Patrick Cantlay and Tommy Fleetwood tied for the lead at 16 under par heading into the final day. Cantlay mounted a late charge with four birdies in his last five holes, positioning himself to challenge Fleetwood, who is seeking a long-awaited victory on American soil. The leaderboard also features Russell Henley two shots behind, while Keegan Bradley's strong performance has intensified speculation about his potential role as a playing captain for the upcoming Ryder Cup. The final round promises a dramatic conclusion to the prestigious golf tournament.</p>

          <p>The immigrant population in the United States has decreased by over one million people since January 2025, falling from a record 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June, according to a Pew Research Center study. This marks a notable reversal of a 50-year growth trend, with the foreign-born share of the population dropping from 15.8% to 15.4%. The study attributes this decline to policy changes under the Trump administration, including executive actions targeting immigration and mass deportations, as well as earlier asylum restrictions. Mexico remains the top country of origin, though its share of the immigrant population has decreased over the past decade.</p>

          <p>A rescue operation for experienced Russian climber Natasha Nagovitsina has been halted nearly two weeks after she became stranded with a broken leg near the summit of Victory Peak in Kyrgyzstan. The 47-year-old has been stuck at an altitude of 22,965 feet since August 12. The mission was suspended following the death of an Italian climber, Luca Sinigaglia, who died of hypothermia after successfully delivering supplies to her. Multiple rescue attempts, including by helicopter, have failed due to treacherous conditions, and rescue leaders now believe her survival is unrealistic given the extreme altitude and duration of her ordeal.</p>

          <p>The governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut have pledged to challenge a Trump administration order that abruptly stopped construction on the nearly completed Revolution Wind farm. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited a need to review the project for "national security interests" in light of a new executive order prioritizing fossil fuels. The offshore wind farm, which was 80% complete, is crucial for both states to meet their climate goals and was expected to power over 350,000 homes. Critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, have condemned the move as a corrupt act favoring the oil industry.</p>

          <p>Scientists have digitally recreated the faces of two men who lived 2,500 years ago, based on skulls excavated from an ancient burial site in Tamil Nadu, India. The project, a collaboration between Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University, aims to understand the appearance and ancestry of the region's early inhabitants. The reconstructed faces show features predominantly of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, with traces of Middle-Eastern and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, suggesting global migration. This research supports findings from the Keeladi archaeological site, which indicate the existence of an independent, literate urban civilization in southern India during that period.</p>

          <p>The parole hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, were thrown into disarray after an audio recording of Erik's hearing was inadvertently released. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation "erroneously" provided the recording to a TV station, leading to a temporary halt in Lyle's subsequent hearing and accusations of unfairness from their legal team. Despite the disruption, the parole board proceeded, ultimately denying parole for both brothers. They will be eligible for another hearing in three years, though they can petition for an earlier one.</p>

The companies cite unresolved questions about how customs duties will be collected and data transmitted under the new policy, which takes effect on August 29.

          <p>The UK government is planning sentencing reforms in England and Wales that would allow courts to impose new restrictions on individuals convicted of crimes. Under the proposed changes, judges could issue bans from pubs, concerts, and sporting events, as well as driving and travel prohibitions, for any offense, even if unrelated to the crime committed. The Ministry of Justice states these measures are intended to toughen community punishments and serve as a deterrent to reoffending. The reforms are part of a broader strategy to manage prison overcrowding by making non-custodial sentences more stringent.</p>

A subsequent evaluation recommended a more significant thoracic outlet decompression surgery, which will sideline the 35-year-old ace and likely delay his start to the 2026 season. Wheeler was having an exceptional year, leading the National League with 195 strikeouts and was considered a leading candidate for the Cy Young Award.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams rookie tight end Terrance Ferguson made an impressive debut in the team's preseason game against the Cleveland Browns. After missing the first two games with a hamstring injury, the second-round draft pick showcased his potential with two key catches, including a 33-yard reception that highlighted his vertical speed. Coach Sean McVay praised Ferguson's performance, noting that his presence was immediately felt on the field. The strong showing suggests Ferguson will be a significant contributor in the Rams' offense alongside veteran tight ends Tyler Higbee and Colby Parkinson.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is dominating the fundraising efforts in the New York City mayoral race, having raised nearly double the amount of his closest rivals between July and mid-August. Campaign finance records show Mamdani raised over $1 million, reflecting strong grassroots support. This financial advantage is mirrored in recent polls, which place him with a significant double-digit lead over his main challengers, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who are both running as independents. As the election enters its final months, pressure is expected to mount on the trailing candidates to consolidate the opposition against Mamdani.</p>

Led by director Kassem Istanbouli, a civil society initiative has revived the venue, aiming to provide a space for art that transcends Lebanon's political and sectarian divisions. Hamra, which suffered during the civil war and is now struggling through the country's severe economic collapse, has historically been a reflection of Lebanon's broader challenges.

          <p>Chinese corporate investment is driving both green energy projects and polluting industries across Southeast Asia, creating a complex environmental legacy. While Beijing is a major financier of renewable energy in the region, Chinese companies are also heavily involved in sectors like nickel processing in Indonesia and rare earth mining in Myanmar. These operations have been linked to environmental damage and have sparked local protests and political tensions. Analysts suggest this industrial shift is driven by stricter regulations within China and weaker enforcement in neighboring countries, posing a challenge to the region's sustainable development goals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funding from Los Angeles and 30 other cities and counties over their "sanctuary" policies. The preliminary injunction expands on a previous ruling, stating that the president's executive order threatening to cut funding is likely unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. These sanctuary policies typically limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agencies but do not prevent them from enforcing judicial warrants. The ruling marks another setback for the administration's ongoing efforts to compel local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration enforcement.</p>

The blaze is one of several active wildfires in the western U.S., including the Flat Fire in Oregon, which has also forced evacuations due to persistent heat and dry conditions.

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongfully deported and then returned to the U.S., claim the government is trying to coerce him into a guilty plea. They allege that after he rejected a plea deal involving deportation to Costa Rica, officials threatened to deport him to Uganda instead. Abrego Garcia was initially depicted by the Trump administration as a gang member and was deported despite a court order protecting him. His lawyers argue the continued legal pressure is a vindictive response to his successful challenge of the original deportation.</p>

Lee accused the Trump administration's DOJ of "pretending to respond" to a congressional subpoena for the files. The release came on the same day the DOJ also published transcripts of its interview with Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

The review describes the film as a "sweaty hoot" and an "expensive reality show," more of a melodramatic potboiler than a deep exploration of the human condition.
