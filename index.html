        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Inditex, the parent company of Zara, experienced a decline of over 6% following the release of weaker-than-anticipated quarterly sales figures. The company reported revenues of 8.27 billion euros for the fiscal first quarter, falling short of the 8.39 billion euros projected by analysts. Furthermore, Inditex indicated a slower start to summer sales, with a 6% increase compared to the previous year's 12% growth, reflecting broader economic uncertainty. The company is closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S., its second-largest market. Optimism may be tempered due to broader market uncertainty and slower sales. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly apologized for certain social media posts directed at Donald Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far." This statement follows a public dispute that dissolved a partnership where Musk spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump's administration. The conflict originated from Musk's disagreement with the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill. Musk had also accused Trump of being mentioned in the "files" of the late sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein, which the White House disputed. The initial conflict led Trump to suggest terminating government contracts and subsidies awarded to Musk's companies. </p>

          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second consecutive night of unrest as protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police.

During the unrest, rioters set cars on fire, smashed windows of houses, and blocked roads, while police responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. Tensions in the area have been rising, with some residents expressing fears about illegal immigration, and some politicians fearing someone will be killed. </p>

          <p>Asia is progressively reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, leading to de-dollarization in the region. ASEAN has committed to increasing the use of local currencies in trade and investment to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations and strengthen regional payment connectivity. The shift is fueled by the recognition that the dollar can be leveraged in trade negotiations, prompting a reevaluation of overweight U.S. dollar portfolios. Asian economies are seeking to reduce reliance on the greenback to lower FX risks by using their own currencies as a medium of exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent ICE raids in the Los Angeles fashion district have left businesses struggling due to a sharp decline in customers and workers. Business owners report a significant drop in sales, with some experiencing a 20% additional loss after the raids, exacerbating the already challenging economic conditions. Many workers have stayed home out of fear, and the absence of customers in the retail areas has had a ripple effect on wholesale businesses. The situation has created uncertainty and financial strain for business owners who are worried about paying rent and sustaining their businesses. </p>

          <p>According to PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer report, employer demand for formal degrees is declining, particularly in AI-exposed fields. The report suggests that AI's ability to facilitate rapid knowledge acquisition makes formal qualifications less relevant. Employers are increasingly prioritizing current skills over past education, and skills are changing 66% faster in AI-exposed occupations. Upskilling on AI is recommended to adapt to the rapidly changing work landscape and futureproof careers. (not investment advice)</p>

Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" focuses on the suffering of people in the Middle East, incorporating instruments from the Arabian Mediterranean region and singing Bach's arias in Arabic.

          <p>According to legal experts, testimony regarding Sean "Diddy" Combs' alleged behavior is overshadowing the government's case in his federal trial for sex crimes. An ex-girlfriend, identified as "Jane," testified about Diddy's alleged drug use and sexual fantasies, which, according to attorney David Seltzer, portrays Diddy as a morally reprehensible figure but does not necessarily prove the government's case. The case hinges on whether actions were consensual or coercive, with Diddy's lawyers suggesting Jane chose to participate in the alleged events. If found guilty, Combs faces a minimum of 15 years in prison or a maximum sentence of life in prison. </p>

The decision was driven by a shortage of healthy starting pitchers and a desire to protect their overworked bullpen, with manager Dave Roberts focusing on winning the next game in the series.
