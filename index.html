        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated they denied access to immigration agents at their stadium amid ongoing protests against immigration enforcement in the city. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) clarified that Customs and Border Protection vehicles were present but unrelated to any operation involving the Dodgers. The team is expected to announce support for immigrants affected by the raids, with player KikÃ© HernÃ¡ndez expressing his criticism of the immigration actions. The increased ICE activity in Los Angeles is part of President Trump's broader immigration crackdown, leading to protests and the deployment of additional federal personnel to the area. The situation unfolds against a backdrop of rising arrest and deportation numbers. Optimism is tempered by the potential for escalating tensions and community divisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump likely acted within his authority by federalizing the California National Guard amid protests over immigration raids, thus blocking a lower court order to return control to the governor. The court cited violence during the protests as justification for the federalization, referencing instances where protesters allegedly attacked federal officers and damaged federal buildings. The judges stated that Trump was not required to obtain the governor's consent and that Governor Newsom could not override the president's order. The appeals court's decision puts a hold on the lower court's order, allowing the Trump administration to maintain control of the guard as the case proceeds through the courts.</p>

          <p>A study analyzing nearly two billion words online found that Americans use vulgar language more frequently than other English-speaking groups. Linguists assessed websites, blogs, and other online sources across 20 English-speaking regions. The study suggests the anonymity of the internet may contribute to the higher rate of swearing among Americans online. Researchers believe understanding the cultural context of swearing can help non-native speakers integrate into new environments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles. The court sided with oil and gas companies and Republican-led states who argued that California's waiver, allowing it to set tougher standards, caused financial harm. This decision potentially undermines one of the key tools used to curb emissions in recent years, as other states often follow California's lead. The ruling overturns a lower court's decision, allowing the fuel industry to challenge the EPA's decision to let California set its own regulations.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting a yellow warning for thunderstorms in parts of England and Wales. The Met Office has issued the storm warning from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is in place, warning of likely pressures on health and social care services.

          <p>A new study reveals that stricter state gun control measures are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children, while more permissive states have seen an increase. The study, published in Jama Pediatrics, examined pediatric firearm death rates in states categorized by the strength of their gun control laws. States with stricter laws, such as background checks and safe-storage requirements, saw stagnant or decreasing rates. Experts emphasize the need for policymakers to prioritize measures that protect society, especially children, from gun violence.</p>

          <p>For half a year, a heated debate has raged over whether US President Donald Trumpâ€™s return to office would push Europe and China closer together. Pragmatists, realpolitikers and Beijingâ€™s allies argued that the EU could not afford a trade war with both of the worldâ€™s largest economies while footing the bill for a hot war in Ukraine For months, EU leaders fuelled the speculation by voicing openness to deeper trade ties with Beijing, in a dramatic rhetorical shift from the previous three years of hostilities. Brussels, staggered by Beijingâ€™s failure to move even an inch on its trade gripes, has had enough.</p>
