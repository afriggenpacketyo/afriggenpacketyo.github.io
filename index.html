          <p>Iran launched ballistic missiles toward Israel in response to Israeli airstrikes that targeted over 200 sites within Iran. According to Iran's state news agency, this operation, dubbed "Hard Retaliation," was a decisive response to the Zionist regime's recent attacks. The Israeli Defense Forces confirmed the missile launches and instructed the public to seek shelter in protected spaces. U.S. stock markets experienced a downturn following the news, and Iran announced its withdrawal from nuclear negotiations with the United States. The strikes and counterstrikes have led to heightened tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Israel and Iran have engaged in a series of escalating attacks, with Israel launching over 200 airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones at Israel, prompting warning sirens and instructions for Israelis to seek shelter. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the operation as a preemptive measure to counter Iran's plan to destroy Israel. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has urged de-escalation, while the U.S. has stated it was not involved in Israel's strikes, and the exchange of attacks has heightened concerns about a broader regional conflict.</p>

The book examines how saying no to one thing can open up possibilities for something else. Febos describes her year of celibacy as a way to widen her aperture and discover things that had previously escaped her notice. The author uses a metaphor to explain why she took a break from sex, dating, and even flirtation: "it made sense to keep the channel of one‚Äôs heart narrowed the width of a single person, to peer through the keyhole at a single room rather than turn to face the world."</p>

          <p>Following Israel's strikes against Iran, the question arises whether the U.S. will be drawn into the conflict. While President Trump initially seemed hesitant, he later expressed support for Israel's actions. The extent of U.S. involvement could escalate depending on Iran's response, which may include attacks on U.S. assets in the region. Analysts suggest that Israel is counting on U.S. assistance in defending against potential Iranian missile attacks.

          <p>Emma Raducanu lost to Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals of the Queen's Club Championships. Despite a promising start, Raducanu struggled to maintain consistency against Zheng, who capitalized on Raducanu's errors. Raducanu took a medical timeout for her back, but Zheng ultimately won the match in three sets. Despite the loss, Raducanu can remain confident that she can perform well on the grass, but she will know there is still a gap to be bridged when it comes to challenging the very best.</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with senators discussing proposed revisions to various provisions of the House-approved package. Key areas of focus include SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), SALT (state and local tax deductions), border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Changes to SNAP may lessen the burden on states, while the SALT cap is likely to be lowered. Rand Paul is advocating for reduced border security funding, and Medicaid changes remain an open question. The Senate aims to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders reflect a shift in strategy following the October 7 attack. The successful campaign against Hezbollah in August and September provided a proof of concept for the current operation. Diminished fear of diplomatic blowback and a perception that the U.S. is less likely to intervene have also contributed to Israel's decision. Netanyahu's political challenges may have also influenced the timing of the strikes, as he seeks to bolster his standing and potentially call a snap election.</p>
