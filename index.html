          <p>An opinion article argues that former President Trump's policies are eroding U.S. soft power, allowing China to gain influence on the global stage. Actions such as attacks on academic freedom, cuts to federal research grants, and authoritarian tendencies are undermining America's attractiveness and trustworthiness. The author contends that Trump's administration prioritizes loyalty over expertise and attempts to control news coverage, weakening the rule of law, a cornerstone of U.S. soft power, and tarnishing its democratic image. According to the article, these actions risk a brain drain and impair the nation's capacity to attract and retain talent.</p>

          <p>The approval rating for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low of 27.4%, according to a recent Kyodo News poll. Dissatisfaction is growing due to Ishiba's dismissal of consumption tax cuts as a solution to rising prices, with 73.2% of respondents favoring consumption tax cuts on food items or all products. The survey also indicated that 87.1% of respondents felt the government's efforts to control rising rice prices were insufficient. The disapproval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet rose to 55.1% amid concerns over potential declines in social security services if consumption taxes are reduced.</p>

          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City on Saturday evening, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 19 others. According to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the ship, carrying 277 people, lost power before drifting into the bridge's underside, causing significant damage to its masts. Bridge inspectors found no structural damage to the bridge itself, and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident. The ship was en route from Cozumel, Mexico, to Iceland, and authorities briefly closed the bridge to traffic following the collision.</p>

The article emphasizes that the Hall of Fame should honor greatness, not character, and that Rose's contributions to the sport deserve recognition.

          <p>Former President Trump is pushing forward with a new section of border wall in southern Arizona, threatening a crucial wildlife corridor. The area is one of the most biodiverse regions in the U.S., home to rare animals like bears, mountain lions, and jaguars. Conservationists warn that the wall will sever migration routes and disrupt ecosystems. Critics call the project an expensive, unnecessary, and environmentally disastrous effort, especially since unauthorized crossings in the area are low.</p>

They read the writing on the wall. Now theyâ€™re ahead of the game. Good for them.</p>

          <p>An expert warns that the current pause in trade tensions with China is likely temporary, urging small businesses to prepare for renewed tariffs and economic conflict. Despite the suspension of some tariffs, existing levies remain high, and the underlying issues driving the trade war persist. The article suggests that businesses should consider strategies such as stockpiling goods, finding alternative suppliers, or bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. The author concludes that businesses should plan accordingly for future volatility and potential disruptions to trade with China.</p>

          <p>An article explores the often-overlooked lives of Victorian orchid hunters, who, unlike the romanticized image of bold explorers, were often poor and exploited laborers.
