          <p>California state officials have filed an emergency request to block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles, citing it as an unlawful militarization. The hearing will address whether the deployment, justified by the administration under Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, is legally sound. California argues that the civil unrest does not warrant federal intervention, while the Justice Department contends that limiting the military's role would hinder federal law enforcement. The situation involves approximately 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines deployed following protests over immigration raids, with Trump asserting the situation in Los Angeles was out of control. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will maintain a "golden share" in U.S. Steel following its acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel, asserting that this will give the U.S. continued control with 51% ownership. This agreement is described as a national security measure to ensure production levels are maintained, however, the details of this arrangement remain unclear, as the White House, U.S. Steel, and Nippon have not provided specific information about the deal's structure or finalization. The United Steelworkers union has also demanded clarity on the terms of the partnership, expressing uncertainty about its difference from Nippon's initial proposal to acquire U.S. Steel as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Trump stated that he has yet to approve the final deal with Nippon. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that families can sue the federal government for damages caused by wrong-house raids conducted by federal law enforcement, protecting victims of misconduct. The decision revives a lawsuit filed by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017, causing property damage and emotional distress to Martin's young son. Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that while the Federal Tort Claims Act permits some suits for wrong-house raids, the scope of its permission is not entirely clear, and the case has been remanded to a lower court for further consideration regarding potential legal defenses the FBI could invoke. The ruling confirms that victims of federal abuse have a tool to seek accountability. </p>

          <p>A mistrial was declared in Harvey Weinstein's retrial in New York on a charge of third-degree sexual assault against Jessica Mann, due to a disagreement among jurors. The decision comes after the jury delivered a partial verdict, finding Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced his office intends to retry the rape charge against Mann, who is prepared for a third trial. The deliberations were marked by tension, with one juror alleging threats from another, leading to a security detail for the foreperson. </p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that a Republican tax and spending bill would disproportionately benefit the nation's highest-paid workers, while negatively impacting low-income families. The bill includes over $3 trillion in tax cuts and $1 trillion in reduced government spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Families earning less than $55,000 a year would experience a net loss due to benefit cutbacks outweighing any tax savings, while the top 10% of earners would see annual savings of approximately $12,000. The CBO director noted that resources would generally decrease for households at the bottom of the income distribution and increase for those in the middle and top. </p>

          <p>The price of gold could potentially reach a new record high this week, surpassing $3,400 per ounce, due to the recent uptick in inflation. The inflation report release showed a 0.1% rise in the rate for May, moving away from the Federal Reserve's desired trend. Historically, rising inflation tends to drive investors to gold as a safe-haven asset. Geopolitical tensions also contribute to the potential for increased gold prices, with trade deals and overseas stability influencing investor motivation to hold gold. (not investment advice)</p>

The mistrial follows Weinstein's earlier conviction being overturned last year, leading to the new trial in September.

While over 165 countries have banned or restricted ractopamine, citing health concerns, the FDA maintains that it is safe for human consumption, and it is unknown whether Kennedy will take action on this issue.

Cuomo, with a substantial résumé and financial backing, is facing criticism for his past scandals and unpopularity, while Mamdani, a progressive with grassroots support, is gaining traction with his policy proposals. The ranked-choice voting system is complicating the race, as candidates are considering cross-endorsements and voters strategize on how to rank their choices.

Greenberg's departure comes less than two weeks into hurricane season, and follows the announced departure of Tony Robinson, the regional administrator for FEMA Region 6, and his deputy, Traci Brasher. Sources say these experienced career staffers are leaving due to disagreements with the current administration's direction, which includes plans to "wean" states off FEMA assistance.

          <p>Medical debt financing and “patient access” companies are pitching their services to struggling rural hospitals, as congressional Republicans consider healthcare cuts that could leave 16 million Americans without insurance. These companies act as middlemen between hospitals and patients, offering solutions for cash-poor hospitals seeking to get paid by “subprime patients”. Firms like Curae offer hospitals money from every conceivable source, such as insurers, discount drug programs, philanthropy and patients, while charging hospitals a “processing fee” of up to 6% for every transaction. While these firms provide access for some patients, there are concerns that they are pushing patients who might be eligible for free or discounted care into payment plans. </p>
