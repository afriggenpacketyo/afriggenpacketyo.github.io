          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. is prepared to engage in diplomatic talks with Iran following recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Rubio cautioned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil transit route, emphasizing that such action would be "suicidal" due to the international repercussions. He highlighted that President Trump prefers diplomacy, urging Iran to negotiate on its nuclear ambitions. Rubio also affirmed the U.S. commitment to defending its interests and allies in the Middle East against potential Iranian retaliation, indicating a firm stance while leaving room for diplomatic resolution. Optimism surrounding a potential deal is tempered by the possibility of further escalation. </p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to use its influence to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil supplies. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports, noting that blocking it would have severe consequences for the global economy. This appeal follows warnings from Iranian officials about potential responses to recent U.S. military actions, including the possibility of closing the strait. The U.S. maintains a military presence in the region to protect maritime trade, but analysts warn that the risk of disruption should not be underestimated. </p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel is not attempting to involve the U.S. in its conflict with Iran, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Herzog described the U.S. decision to strike Iran's nuclear infrastructure as "the right step" for American and global security, citing the Iranian nuclear program as a threat. Despite the military involvement, Herzog emphasized the importance of diplomacy and urged for renewed talks with Iran that are clear and substantive, given past failures in negotiations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed Herzog's message, asserting that the U.S. is not at war with Iran but remains open to a diplomatic path forward. </p>

          <p>A columnist argues against the practice of immigration agents wearing masks, citing incidents where masked agents detained individuals, including a New York City Comptroller. The author contends that this practice undermines accountability, potentially violates Department of Homeland Security regulations requiring identification during arrests, and creates confusion that could lead to public interference. While acknowledging the need for face coverings in specific high-risk situations, the columnist advocates for a ban on masked immigration agents to ensure transparency and prevent potential abuses of power. The article suggests that masking can foster a sense of intimidation and secrecy, which is detrimental to a democratic society.</p>

Analysts suggest that the Gulf's call for de-escalation and peaceful resolution has helped insulate it from major market disruptions, with some viewing the removal of the Iranian threat as a potentially positive development.

          <p>A study analyzing over 200 parent-child relationships identified five phrases that commonly cause children to resist listening. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying," trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering their ability to learn and cooperate. The study suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, promoting better communication and cooperation. By shifting from controlling language to empathetic and respectful communication, parents can foster a more positive and effective relationship with their children.</p>

          <p>A Florida homeowner is facing a potential $5,000 fine after a neighbor complained about her 8-inch grass, despite the absence of specific regulations on grass height in her area. The city code enforcement relies on comparing the homeowner's lawn to neighboring properties, leading to a violation based on subjective judgment. The homeowner is exploring a legal workaround by converting her yard into a certified Florida native habitat, which is protected under state landscaping laws. This situation highlights the potential for disputes and the importance of clear and objective regulations.</p>

Israeli leaders lauded the strikes, while Iran vowed retaliation. UN Secretary-General Guterres expressed grave alarm and urged de-escalation. Iran's allies, Hamas and the Houthis, condemned the "American aggression" and pledged to join in retaliation. China's state-run media questioned whether the U.S. was repeating the "Iraq mistake," while the UK called on Iran to negotiate.
