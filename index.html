          <p>The Israeli military stated that its troops opened fire near a Gaza aid distribution site after individuals deviated from a designated route. Gaza health officials reported 27 fatalities as a result of the incident. The military claims that warning shots were fired before additional shots were directed near individuals advancing towards the forces in a threatening manner. The IDF has launched an investigation into the casualties and maintains that it permits the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to operate independently in distributing aid while preventing it from reaching Hamas, but the UN Secretary-General has called for an independent investigation. Optimism is low given the loss of life and conflicting accounts.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is uncertain after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest £4bn into the company, deemed a setback in securing the company's future. The company serves about a quarter of the UK's population and employs 8,000 people. The company stated that it would proceed with an alternative plan and that the water services will continue as normal, regardless of who owns Thames. An independent review of the water industry says the current regulatory system is "chaotic" and needs to change, while Thames Water faces mounting debts after borrowing heavily since privatization in 1989.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The commander of the German army division responsible for homeland security suggested that Germany might need to introduce some form of conscription to ensure sufficient soldiers for critical defense infrastructure protection. Major General Andreas Henne stated that relying solely on volunteers may not suffice to enlist the necessary military personnel. The coalition agreement includes a plan for a new military service model based on voluntary enlistment initially, but Henne's comments indicate a potential shift in strategy. The plan is a compromise between demands for a completely voluntary system and the desire to end the current suspension of compulsory military service in Germany that was put in place in 2011.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has found that it is failing and requires stronger regulation to better protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted concerns about pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures that have shaken public trust. The review recommends clearer direction from the government, improved long-term investment strategies, and a stronger voice for local communities, while the government has ruled out nationalizing the sector. The commission's findings suggest a need for new legislation and a significant streamlining of regulators.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search in Portugal for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared nearly two decades ago. Madeleine was three years old when she vanished from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz in Algarve during a family holiday on May 3, 2007. The search, covering the municipality of Lagos near Praia da Luz, is expected to continue until Friday, with German police taking the lead in the case. German investigators identified Christian Brückner as their prime suspect in 2020, and he is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate crime, but denies any involvement in McCann's disappearance.</p>

Havering Council has provided advice to the school, including legal deterrents and hiring a falconry expert, but intervention options are limited as buzzards are a protected species.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has sharply cut its forecast for US economic growth, projecting a slowdown to 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026. This is attributed to President Trump's trade wars, which disrupt global commerce, raise costs, and create uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The OECD notes that Trump’s policies have significantly increased average US tariff rates, the highest since 1938, impacting both consumers and manufacturers. The report also forecasts a slowdown in world economic growth, further highlighting the negative effects of increased trade barriers and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch coalition government led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof has collapsed after Geert Wilders, the head of the far-right PVV, withdrew his party due to disagreements over immigration policy. Wilders had been frustrated with the slow pace of introducing stricter immigration policies, including border closures for asylum-seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of a crime. The government crisis occurs weeks before the Netherlands is due to host world leaders for a NATO summit, with some suggesting that Wilders was looking to collapse the government by creating a crisis.

          <p>Two Japanese nationals were killed in Dalian, northeastern China’s Liaoning province, and a Chinese suspect has been detained as authorities investigate the deaths. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that the victims were Japanese and that the alleged killer was their business partner, with the incident stemming from a conflict over business matters. Dalian police stated that the suspect, a 42-year-old man surnamed Yuan who had been living in Japan, was apprehended the day after the deaths.

          <p>During the Spanish Grand Prix, Red Bull ordered Max Verstappen to give up his fourth-place position after an incident with George Russell in Turn One. The stewards later determined that Russell had momentarily lost control and collided with Verstappen, who did not deliberately leave the track, leading to no further action. Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, admitted that the decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was also a mistake. Horner stated that they should have left him out on his soft tires, but they went with the information they had at hand.</p>

          <p>Beijing has amplified its warnings over cutthroat price wars among carmakers, as deflationary pressure persists in China’s economy. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), party mouthpieces, and a carmaker association have voiced concerns over recent discounts offered by manufacturers. They collectively deem price wars a threat to product quality and the long-term development of the industry. The MIIT vowed to step up governance over such competition, while People’s Daily described the domestic carmaking sector as being in a “sub-healthy” state due to shrinking profit margins and industrial overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has further cut economic growth forecasts for the U.S. and globally, citing the impact of President Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026, attributing the downgrade to fallout from Trump's tariffs, economic policy uncertainty, and a slowdown in net immigration. The OECD also expects global growth to be lower than previously forecast, with the slowdown concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Frequent changes regarding tariffs have led to uncertainty in global markets and economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's heavy industries minister stated that Tesla is "not interested in manufacturing in India," despite the country's efforts to lure investment dollars from the EV giant. Tesla is expected to open two showrooms in India and have a retail presence, but the company's original plans to open a base were shelved in 2022 after the Indian government insisted that Tesla make cars locally. Last year, India cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers that committed to investing $500m and starting local production within three years. Analysts suggest that the Indian EV market may not be mature enough yet for Tesla to invest locally.</p>

Despite a strong start from Dustin May and late-game heroics from Shohei Ohtani, Scott's performance squandered the team's chances.
