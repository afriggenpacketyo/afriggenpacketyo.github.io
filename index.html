          <p>A hot mic captured Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussing the potential for biotechnology and organ transplants to extend human life to 150 years. The conversation occurred during a military parade in Beijing, where Putin suggested that with continuous organ transplants, one could even achieve immortality. However, Dr. James Markmann, a leading U.S. transplant surgeon, dismissed these claims as scientifically unfounded. He emphasized that the focus of transplantation should be on ethical concerns like equity and access for the over 100,000 Americans currently awaiting life-saving organs, not on speculative ideas of immortality.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has denounced reports of potential White House interference in the city's election as an "affront to our democracy." The New York Times reported that President Trump's advisers considered offering administration jobs to Mayor Eric Adams and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa to clear the field for a race between Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani stated this news reveals that Cuomo is Trump's preferred candidate and that such backroom deals undermine the democratic process. Both Adams' and Sliwa's campaigns have denied being contacted by the White House or considering any such offers.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr must significantly increase their delivery numbers in the coming months to meet their targets of breaking even by 2025. While second-quarter losses have narrowed due to aggressive price discounts stimulating sales, the ongoing discount war in the world's largest auto market continues to apply intense financial pressure. Companies are finding it difficult to raise new funds amid investor concerns about overcapacity in the industry. To survive, Nio's CEO stated the company aims to double its second-quarter sales and deliver 50,000 vehicles per month by the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting titled "Portrait of a Lady," which was looted by the Nazis during World War II, has been recovered in Argentina. The artwork by Giuseppe Ghislandi was rediscovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing it. Dutch journalists investigating the officer's past spotted the painting, leading to a police investigation and its eventual surrender to authorities. The painting originally belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose heirs have been seeking to recover hundreds of missing works from his collection.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, served as a powerful display of its growing military and technological strength, signaling a challenge to the U.S.-led global order.

The event also underscored shifting geopolitical alignments, with leaders from Russia and India meeting with Xi Jinping, potentially forming an economic bloc to counter the effects of Trump's tariff policies. This development, combined with legal challenges to the tariffs in U.S. courts, illustrates the significant risks of the administration's "America first" trade strategy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly using the U.S. military for law enforcement purposes, a departure from its traditional role of national defense. This shift is highlighted by a recent lethal drone strike against a boat of alleged "narco-terrorists" in the Caribbean, an action authorized under a new directive targeting drug smugglers. Critics argue this expansion blurs the lines between military and police functions and sets a dangerous precedent by applying counterterrorism tactics to crime fighting. The administration has justified the action by designating the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, though intelligence agencies have questioned the gang's ties to the Venezuelan government.</p>

The positive movement came despite underlying fears about the global economy, with bond markets remaining a key focus for investors. A recent U.S. court ruling that deemed most of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal has raised questions about future tariff revenues, contributing to pressure on long-term borrowing costs globally.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had invoked the wartime law to expel hundreds of individuals accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The court determined that encouraging illegal immigration is not equivalent to an armed invasion, rejecting the government's legal justification for the rapid deportations. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of using obscure and powerful statutes to enact its immigration policies.</p>

This approach is a response to the existential threats of big agriculture and extreme weather, which squeeze producer margins.

          <p>An Afghan family, including a father and his two children, has been held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention for months, caught in a bureaucratic stalemate between the United States and Canada. The family is eligible for asylum in Canada, where other relatives are already refugees, but they can only make their claim at a land border. U.S. officials will only release them for air travel, for which they lack the necessary Canadian visa. Their lawyers argue this situation puts them at risk of deportation back to Afghanistan, where the father, who worked with U.S. troops, could be targeted by the Taliban.</p>

          <p>In Vladivostok, a Russian port city over 4,000 miles from Ukraine, the consequences of the ongoing war are palpable despite the physical distance. The local cemetery has rows of fresh graves for soldiers killed in what the Kremlin calls the "Special Military Operation." For some, like a mobilized soldier who lost his leg and now plays for a para ice hockey team, the war has had a direct, life-altering impact. For others, daily life continues with a sense of resignation, as many residents feel powerless to influence events and prefer not to discuss the conflict, hoping for a return to normalcy.</p>

          <p>Parents and health charities in the UK are raising alarms about a lack of dedicated services for children with chronic constipation, an issue that is leading to a 10-year high in hospital admissions. One mother described her son's severe case, which was repeatedly dismissed until he reached a crisis point where a significant portion of his body weight was impacted stool. Experts state that a disparity in children's continence services across the country means many families cannot access the necessary community-based care, leading to preventable emergency room visits. Factors like delayed potty training and increased time in childcare are cited as potential contributors to the rising problem.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 268,000 Venezuelan migrants, revoking their legal status and work permits within the next 60 days. This decision affects individuals covered under a TPS program established in 2021, and officials are urging them to self-deport. The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program acts as a magnet for illegal immigration and undermines border security efforts. This move is part of a broader administration strategy to curtail humanitarian protections for migrants from countries facing political instability, war, or other crises, making them eligible for deportation.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that American sentiment toward the U.S. economy remains largely negative, with most respondents choosing words like "uncertain" and "struggling" to describe its current state. Positive ratings have dipped slightly over the last month, continuing a trend seen throughout the year. The primary driver of this pessimism is the perception of rising prices, with two-thirds of Americans stating that prices are still increasing and expecting them to continue to do so. While personal financial ratings vary by income, the overall economic outlook is bleak, as a majority believe the economy is getting worse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appears to be taking a "victory lap" after a series of moves that have fundamentally reshaped the CDC and sidelined its scientific leadership. In a recent op-ed, he praised his own response to a severe measles outbreak in Texas, which he claimed ended quickly, despite data showing it was the nation's worst since 1992. This follows his firing of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, the resignation of several top officials in protest, and his promotion of unproven alternative remedies. Critics argue that Kennedy's actions have undermined the agency's credibility and public health efforts, replacing scientific guidance with ideology.</p>

          <p>As Utah's Great Salt Lake continues to shrink to crisis levels, scientists have made a surprising discovery of mysterious, groundwater-fed oases hidden beneath the exposed lakebed. Researchers from the University of Utah identified reed-covered mounds and other surface disturbances that suggest a vast underground plumbing system is pushing fresh water up from below. This discovery has stunned scientists, who are now mapping these hidden freshwater reserves. The findings could have significant implications for the region's hydrology and may offer new strategies for restoring the fragile lakebed crusts and reducing the hazardous dust pollution caused by the lake's decline.</p>
