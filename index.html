          <p>A new report from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office reveals that domestic violence cases reached an all-time high in 2024, with nearly 257,000 victims registered. This represents a 3.7% increase from the previous year, with women accounting for 73% of the victims. In separate news, a key railway line between Düsseldorf and Duisburg has reopened following repairs from suspected arson attacks believed to be carried out by left-wing extremists. Additionally, a German consumer group is suing several budget airlines over what it claims are illegal fees for hand luggage.</p>

During a visit to Guangdong province, he instructed local authorities to enhance port quarantines, improve prevention efforts, and eliminate mosquitoes to stop the virus's spread. As of late July, Guangdong had reported over 4,800 cases, with Foshan accounting for about 60% of them, marking China's most severe outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease in decades. No fatalities have been reported from the outbreak.</p>

This trend is highlighted by numerous social media posts where commuters share tips on navigating the cross-border journey, which can take 90 minutes or more each way. For many, the trade-off between a lengthy commute and the high cost of renting in Hong Kong is a practical financial decision, reflecting the economic pressures faced by young professionals.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has expressed his unease over the transfer situation involving star striker Alexander Isak, calling it "complex" and "far from ideal." The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the Swedish international, whom they value at around £150 million. Howe revealed he is not in direct contact with Isak, who is currently training alone at his former club after being left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour. The manager stated his wish is to see Isak play for Newcastle again.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the release of disappointing jobs data. Trump accused the agency of rigging the figures, a claim he made without evidence, while markets plunged amid concerns over his new tariff policies. The jobs report showed only 73,000 jobs were added in July, far below expectations, which economists attribute to tariff-related uncertainty. The move has drawn sharp criticism, with many accusing the president of politicizing economic data and undermining trust in government institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's latest round of import tariffs has triggered negative reactions across global financial markets and drawn criticism from key US trading partners. The new duties, affecting countries like Canada, India, Switzerland, and the European Union, caused stock markets in the US, Europe, and Asia to fall sharply. Several nations, including South Africa and India, are engaging in urgent negotiations to avert the economic impact before the tariffs take full effect. The move has intensified worries about a weakening global economy and the stability of international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Son Heung-min, the captain of Tottenham Hotspur, has announced he will be leaving the club this summer after a decade in North London. The 33-year-old South Korean star, who is reportedly in talks with Los Angeles FC, described the decision as the most difficult of his career. Son scored 173 goals for Spurs and recently captained them to their first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League. His final appearance for the club could be in his home country of South Korea during a pre-season friendly.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary history of the potato, revealing a surprising connection to an ancient forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists discovered that the modern potato originated from a hybridization event about nine million years ago between a tomato ancestor and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient cross-breeding was a key driver in the development of tubers, the edible part that has made the potato a global staple food. The findings shed new light on the origins of this vital crop.</p>

          <p>A significant traffic disruption occurred on a Pennsylvania highway after a truck carrying hot dogs had a mechanical failure. The truck's trailer was ripped open after scraping against a concrete divider, spilling its entire cargo of sausages across the road during the Friday morning commute. Cleanup crews were dispatched to the scene in Shrewsbury to deal with the mess. The local fire chief noted the unexpected slipperiness of the hot dogs, which had to be cleared with a front-end loader before the road could be reopened.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court to Hear Louisiana Case on Constitutionality of Racial Redistricting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 22:28:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled a major case for its next term to decide whether Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court has asked parties to brief the question of whether the map violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. This case stems from a yearslong legal battle over the state's district lines following the 2020 Census. The eventual ruling could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and the practice of creating majority-minority districts across the country.</p>
