          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that it struck multiple military sites within Iran, targeting missile and drone storage facilities, missile launchers, and air defense battery production sites. The IDF reported that approximately 30 IAF fighter jets launched over 60 munitions, including strikes on the 'Imam Hussein' Strategic Missile Command Center in the Yazd area, where long-range Khorramshahr missiles were stored. The IDF statement emphasized its commitment to eliminating threats to Israel within Iranian territory, indicating a significant escalation in regional tensions.

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, described the recent U.S. attacks against Iran as a "massive gamble" by President Donald Trump, drawing parallels to past U.S. military actions in the Middle East. Himes cautioned against premature celebration of the strikes, emphasizing the lack of Congressional approval for the action. He expressed concern over the potential for unintended consequences and the possibility of escalating conflict. Himes suggested that history indicates caution is warranted, as military involvements in the region often lead to unforeseen and negative outcomes.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's new head coach, Enzo Maresca, faces a challenge in accommodating the team's numerous midfielders, including high-profile signings Enzo FernÃ¡ndez, MoisÃ©s Caicedo, and RomÃ©o Lavia, while also ensuring Cole Palmer's role as a No. 10. Maresca experimented with different formations during the Club World Cup, including moving Caicedo to right-back and Reece James into midfield, but these adjustments proved unsuccessful in a 3-1 defeat against Flamengo. The competition for places raises concerns about player frustration and the potential departure of talents like Andrey Santos, who had a successful loan spell at Strasbourg. Maresca must find a way to integrate new signings and manage playing time effectively to maintain squad harmony and compete in both the Premier League and Champions League.</p>

          <p>The United States launched a top-secret precision attack, code-named "Operation Midnight Hammer," on Iran's nuclear facilities, utilizing B-2 Spirit stealth bombers and Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bombs. The mission involved over 125 aircraft, with B-2 bombers flying 18 hours from the U.S. to strike the Natanz and Fordo sites. President Donald Trump announced the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized the operation's limited scope and the intent to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. The mission was described as complex and high-risk, with careful planning to maintain surprise and avoid detection.</p>

The conflict's impact on daily life is surreal, with stocked grocery stores juxtaposed against the devastation of missile strikes. The author questions whether the conflict is a diversion from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's struggles in Gaza, where he has promised an "absolute victory" that he cannot deliver. The author also highlights the distrust in Netanyahu's leadership due to his ongoing corruption trial and the lack of public confidence in his decisions regarding the war.</p>

          <p>Senator Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that the United States must prepare for potential retaliation from Iran following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Cotton emphasized President Trump's commitment to protecting American lives and warned Iran against targeting Americans. He declined to rule out any potential targets for U.S. response, including Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and reiterated that the U.S. is not seeking regime change in Iran. Despite his past advocacy for regime change, Cotton clarified that the current objective is to eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>Details are emerging about the U.S. air strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, with President Donald Trump claiming they have been "obliterated." The operation, dubbed "Midnight Hammer," involved B-2 stealth bombers and Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs). Iran has confirmed the attacks but downplays the damage. The strikes mark a significant escalation in the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential retaliation and regional instability. The international community is reacting with calls for de-escalation and a return to diplomatic negotiations.</p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, discussions are intensifying in Tehran regarding the country's future and the potential removal of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Prior to the U.S. intervention, a group of Iranian figures began formulating a plan to govern Iran without Khamenei, considering Hassan Rouhani for a key role in a leadership committee. The sources suggest that some military officials have been in contact with counterparts from a major Gulf country, seeking support for a change in Iran's leadership. The U.S. has claimed that its bombing was a spectacular success, while Iran has sought to downplay the destruction, and some insiders want to negotiate a deal with Trump, even if it means sidelining Khamenei.</p>

          <p>Following the US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran faces a critical decision on how to respond, with options ranging from immediate retaliation to delayed action or even negotiation. Retaliation could involve attacks on US bases in the Middle East, cyberattacks, or disruption of shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. A delayed response would allow Iran to choose a time of its choosing to launch a surprise attack. Alternatively, Iran could choose to negotiate with the US, potentially averting further conflict but requiring concessions on its nuclear program.</p>

U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020, and the likelihood of violent extremists independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence.</p>

          <p>The bombing of nuclear sites in Iran by Donald Trump was criticized for not having Congressional approval. The author argues that this unilateral action weakens American democracy by depriving citizens of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. The piece draws a contrast with the Iraq War, where a congressional vote allowed citizens to lobby their representatives and hold them accountable for their choices. The lack of a vote on the Iran attack leaves citizens with no official channels to effect change, which could lead to radicalization in the long run.</p>
