          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media following a three-week silence after her American Eagle ad campaign sparked controversy. The campaign, which played on the double meaning of "great genes/jeans," drew a divided response, with some critics alleging it had racial undertones and associations with eugenics, while supporters praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. American Eagle defended the campaign, stating it was always about the jeans. Despite the backlash, reputation management experts suggest the controversy could ultimately boost Sweeney's career and earning potential by increasing her public profile and demonstrating her resilience under pressure.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration enforcement operation in San Bernardino resulted in an agent firing shots at a vehicle after the driver allegedly refused to exit and drove toward officers, injuring two. The driver later contacted police, claiming unknown masked men had shot at him. Video captured by occupants shows agents in vests marked "police" breaking the car's windows before shots are heard. The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice condemned the incident as an "abuse of power." San Bernardino police responded to the scene but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits local law enforcement from assisting with federal immigration enforcement, creating a jurisdictional standoff.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant famous for its celebrity clientele and classic atmosphere, has died at age 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. A former professional soccer player and actor, Tana opened his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining haven that became an institution for Hollywood stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Known for its red-and-white-checkered tablecloths and comforting dishes like chicken Parmesan, the eatery has maintained its old-world charm for decades. Tana sold the restaurant in 2009, but its new ownership has preserved its legacy as a beloved and enduring Los Angeles landmark.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off as trade relations between the two countries continue to deteriorate. The cancellation comes after the Trump administration imposed a cumulative 50% tariff rate on Indian exports, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, highlighting that U.S. and E.U. nations also continue to trade with Russia. The U.S. is India's largest single export partner, making the escalating tensions a significant economic concern for New Delhi. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening slightly to a Category 4 storm. While lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain, the hurricane is forecast to remain a major storm as it moves northwest, staying east of the Bahamas. Though most models predict Erin will remain hundreds of miles off the U.S. East Coast, its presence is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20 to 27. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, are on alert for potential significant beach erosion.</p>

          <p>A long-standing principle in traffic engineering, known as the "85th percentile rule," is being reconsidered by some states and federal authorities amid rising road fatalities. This rule suggests speed limits should be set based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel, effectively letting the fastest drivers dictate the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. In response, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that the rule is not mandatory, encouraging communities to also consider factors like pedestrian safety, crash frequency, and overall road context when setting limits.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The win was significantly aided by a series of mistakes from the Padres in the early innings. Dodgers catcher Will Smith was instrumental, throwing out three Padres attempting to steal bases within the first two frames, neutralizing San Diego's offensive threats. The Dodgers capitalized on walks and a critical two-run error by the Padres' center fielder to build an early 5-0 lead, despite having only one hit. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers to clinch the win.</p>

The European coordination follows a summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin that ended without a ceasefire agreement. Trump has since signaled a shift in strategy, suggesting a direct peace agreement is preferable to a ceasefire, a move that has caused concern in Kyiv and among European allies.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy faces a precarious diplomatic situation as he prepares to meet President Trump in Washington D.C. to discuss a peace settlement with Russia. The visit follows a summit between Trump and Vladimir Putin where Trump appeared to abandon the precondition of a ceasefire, instead advocating for a direct peace agreement. This shift aligns with Russia's position and raises fears in Kyiv that Ukraine will be pressured into ceding more territory while fighting continues.

They claimed Miller suffered extreme physical and psychological abuse from his mother, leading to dissociative amnesia and an inability to recall the killings.

The protests were initially sparked by a deadly railway station collapse last year, which became a symbol of corruption, but have grown into widespread demands for an early election and the resignation of President Aleksandar Vučić.

          <p>A couples therapist and executive counselor outlines five common psychological drivers that can lead individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, to risk their careers and families for an affair. These factors include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to always be "good," the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor boundaries developed from a childhood of caretaking for others. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can make an affair feel like a form of escape or retaliation. Finally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can trigger a re-evaluation of life priorities and make one more vulnerable to an extramarital relationship.</p>
