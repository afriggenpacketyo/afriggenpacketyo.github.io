          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan aims to end the Israel-Hamas war, proposing an immediate ceasefire, a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The plan outlines a demilitarized Gaza governed by a 'technocratic' Palestinian committee and an international stabilization force, with a 'Board of Peace' chaired by Trump overseeing reconstruction. While Prime Minister Netanyahu supports the plan, Hamas's full response is pending, and key questions about its implementation and the path to Palestinian statehood remain.</p>

          <p>Authorities revealed that the suspect in last week's deadly car and knife attack outside a Manchester synagogue, Jihad Al-Shamie, allegedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during an emergency call. Al-Shamie, who was previously on bail for suspicion of sexual assault, rammed a car into pedestrians before attacking them with a knife on Yom Kippur, killing two congregants. Police shot the attacker, who was wearing a hoax explosive device, and are investigating whether he acted alone, with three people still hospitalized from the incident.

          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff revitalized Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, New York, by integrating debate into every class and expanding the debate team. Once a 'persistently dangerous school' with declining enrollment, the school saw proficiency scores in English and math jump significantly. The debate program, which even produced national champions, deepened students' conceptual understanding and fostered a sense of pride within the community. This article showcases how an innovative educational approach can dramatically improve school performance and student engagement.</p>

          <p>Global internet monitor NetBlocks reported that major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat are now restricted on multiple providers in Afghanistan. This follows the Taliban's ban on TikTok in 2022, with users experiencing slow or intermittent service without VPNs. The Taliban has not officially confirmed the restrictions, which come after a complete internet and telecommunications suspension in late September. Rights groups have criticized these cuts, highlighting their severe implications, particularly for women and girls, by isolating the country further from the outside world.</p>
