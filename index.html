          <p>Charles Rangel, who represented New York in Congress for over four decades and was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House from 1971 to 2017, notably chairing the House Ways and Means Committee. His career included accolades for his military service in the Korean War, as well as a censure by the House for ethics violations, though he remained a respected figure and continued to serve in Congress. Tributes have poured in from fellow politicians, acknowledging his significant contributions to Harlem, New York City, and the nation.</p>

          <p>Spain has urged European countries to halt arms shipments to Israel as international condemnation rises over its actions in Gaza. The call came during a meeting of the "Madrid Group," where Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares emphasized that the Middle East needs fewer weapons. While several nations attended the meeting, the primary arms suppliers to Israel are the United States, Germany, and Italy, although Italy is legally prohibited from supplying arms due to the conflict. The article notes that any effective arms embargo would require the participation of the US and Germany, Israel's primary armorers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump delivered a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery, honoring fallen soldiers while also injecting political commentary. He referenced the American Revolutionary War and highlighted Gold Star families, but also criticized his political opponents and the previous administration's border security policies. Trump also expressed excitement for upcoming events like the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and the 2028 Summer Olympics, attributing their timing to divine intervention. The president's remarks followed earlier social media posts where he attacked political adversaries and federal judges.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, has been identified in the United States, prompting concerns about its transmissibility and potential impact. Symptoms are reported to be similar to previous strains, though data suggests it may spread more easily. Meanwhile, the Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access to seniors and those with underlying conditions, requiring new clinical trials for wider use, which could delay access for lower-risk groups. Experts caution that these restrictions may create confusion and reduce vaccination rates, despite the availability of other preventative measures like masking and hygiene practices.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has responded to Donald Trump's recent criticism of Vladimir Putin, labeling it as an "emotional overload" after Russia's intensified aerial attacks on Ukraine. Trump had called Putin "absolutely crazy" following the attacks, which resulted in numerous casualties. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, attributed Trump's comments to the emotional stress of the situation. Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, announced that there were "no longer" range restrictions on arms supplied to Ukraine, allowing them to defend themselves by attacking military positions in Russia.</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, the creator of "Succession," has created a new HBO movie called "Mountainhead," a satire of nihilistic tech oligarchs. The movie centers on three billionaires who gather at a modernist mansion in Utah, where they fantasize about taking over failing nations and running them like start-ups. One of the billionaires releases content tools that make it easier to create deepfakes, leading to global instability. The article suggests that art and entertainment can make such figures feel real in a more visceral, emotional way, and that it is important for pop culture to engage with America‚Äôs disorienting descent into clownish authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are optimistic about resolving the trade war with the US after President Donald Trump delayed imposing 50% tariffs until July 9. The delay followed a call between Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to expedite trade negotiations. The EU has reiterated its "zero-for-zero" offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Trump's history of flip-flopping on border taxes has left businesses uncertain, and his 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place. The EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs on US goods, but they will be reinstated without a deal.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its aerial bombardments on Ukrainian cities, taking advantage of the United States' reduced involvement in the conflict. President Trump has criticized President Putin's actions but has not offered additional military assistance or joined Europe in imposing new sanctions on Russia. With the U.S. pulling back from diplomatic efforts and resisting supplying Kyiv with more aid, Russia has seen an opening to press its advantage. Ukraine is running out of interceptor missiles, making Russian attacks more deadly, and Russia is upgrading its arsenal with harder-to-intercept missiles.</p>
