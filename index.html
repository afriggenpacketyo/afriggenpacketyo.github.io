          <p>Amidst escalating sectarian clashes targeting the Druse minority in Syria, Israeli fighter jets struck near the presidential palace in Damascus, sending a strong message to President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that the strikes were a clear warning to prevent any harm to the Druse community, with whom Israel has historical ties. The intervention marks the second time Israel has militarily intervened in Syria this week, reflecting mounting pressure from the Druse community in Israel for forceful action. The U.S. State Department has urged the Syrian government to halt the violence and hold perpetrators accountable as tensions remain high.</p>

          <p>Facing a trade war with the United States and weak domestic consumption, China is considering lifting its unofficial ban on K-pop acts, which has been in place since 2016. The decision comes as China looks for ways to revitalize domestic demand, with cultural events like concerts and music festivals being promoted to stimulate spending in tourism and hospitality. K-pop is seen as a tariff-proof sector, with core revenue drivers like streaming and concerts being digital and intangible, making them immune to cross-border tariffs. Analysts also suggest that improving relations with South Korea through cultural diplomacy could benefit China economically.</p>

A draft national development planning law is expected to formalize planning processes and implementation at local levels, elevating planning to a new political height.

          <p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reports that global press freedoms have declined to an "all-time low," with the situation worsening in the United States under President Trump's second term. The report indicates that over half the world's population lives in countries with a 'very serious' situation for journalists, with Europe remaining the safest region. Germany has fallen out of the top ten due to an increasingly hostile environment for media professionals, particularly from the far right. The report also highlights the plight of Palestinian journalists reporting on Israel's attacks on Gaza, and Israel itself has fallen in the rankings.</p>

          <p>Shell reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit and announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks. The company's adjusted earnings for the first three months of the year were $5.58 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. CEO Wael Sawan described the earnings as "another solid set of results" and reaffirmed the company's reduced annual investment budget of $20 billion to $22 billion for 2025. The announcement contrasts with British rival BP, which lowered its share buyback after first-quarter profit fell short of expectations.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling its emergence as a rising force in British politics. Sarah Pochin, Reform’s candidate, won by just six votes in Runcorn and Helsby, a seat previously considered safe for the Labour Party. The victory could mark the beginning of a significant show of strength for Reform in local elections across England, potentially accelerating the country's shift toward a more polarized, multiparty system. The party capitalized on anti-incumbent sentiment and tensions over immigration to win support among voters with deep Labour roots.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, citing left-wing bias in their news coverage. The executive order could be challenged in court, as federal funding for NPR and PBS is appropriated by Congress. NPR receives about 1% of its funding directly from the federal government, while PBS receives about 15% of its revenues from CPB's federal funds. The leaders of NPR and PBS testified at a House oversight committee hearing in late March on allegations of ideological bias in public broadcasting.</p>

Parcels worth less than $800 will now be subject to a 120% levy or a flat fee, on top of existing tariffs on Chinese imports. The White House claims sellers in China used deceptive shipping practices to exploit the loophole, and that it allowed deadly drugs to enter the country unchecked.

Labour's support has also fallen heavily since the general election, with their three mayoral successes won on a diminished share of the vote.

          <p>A federal judge permanently barred the Trump administration from invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals from the Southern District of Texas, calling the White House’s use of the statute illegal. The judge ruled that the act, intended for times of declared war or military invasion, was improperly applied to modern immigration policy. The decision, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases challenging the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The judge also found that the terms in the act did not align with Mr. Trump’s claims about the activities of Tren de Aragua.</p>
