          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 18:16:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department has unsealed federal terrorism charges against Jose Enrique Martinez Flores, an alleged high-ranking member of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, who was arrested in Colombia. Flores is the first TdA member charged with terrorism since the gang was designated as a terrorist organization by President Trump. Prosecutors allege Flores helped deliver cocaine for international distribution to further TdA's criminal goals. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that TdA is a highly structured terrorist organization that took root in the U.S. during the previous administration, and the FBI Director Kash Patel stated that the FBI continues in its pursuit to eliminate this violent terrorist organization from our streets. This case highlights the government's strategy in prosecuting and dismantling the gang, though questions arise about the consistency of this approach with the rushed deportations of alleged members to El Salvador.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that 59% of Americans disapprove of President Trump's increasing tariffs on imported goods. This comes as stocks attempted a recovery after market volatility fueled by fears that Trump would fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, however Trump stated that he would not fire Powell. China has criticized the U.S. for coercion and threats related to the trade war, but Trump has dismissed concerns and promised to be "nice".

This shift comes as Google aims to cut costs and invest heavily in artificial intelligence, with co-founder Sergey Brin advocating for in-office work to boost productivity.

CEO Scott Boatwright noted that customers began pulling back their spending in February due to economic uncertainty, and the traffic slowdown has continued into April.

          <p>Mexico is seeing a growing movement to phase out narcocorridos, a genre of music that glorifies drug cartels, due to criticism that it promotes violence and criminal activity. Musician Luis R. Conriquez announced he would not perform his signature songs, leading to booing and trashed instruments from the crowd. The move reflects a broader effort to curb the influence of drug culture and address the violence plaguing the country. Many critics argue that the music celebrates criminals and normalizes their actions.</p>
