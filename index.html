          <p>Many California families are finding it increasingly difficult to afford car ownership due to high transportation costs, impacting their ability to maintain a decent standard of living. Franchescoli Andrade, a South Los Angeles resident, relies on a combination of biking, train, and bus to commute 20 miles to the San Fernando Valley, a journey that takes 90 minutes each way. A United Way study reveals that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living expenses like rent, groceries, and gas. The rising costs of car ownership, including payments, insurance, maintenance, and fuel, make transportation a significant financial burden for many families, with potential solutions including increased public transportation and support for affordable housing near job centers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approach to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran is causing divisions among his supporters, with some urging caution against further involvement in the Middle East. Trump has stated he remains undecided about direct U.S. intervention, a stance that contrasts with his usual reluctance toward foreign entanglements. Speaking to reporters, Trump acknowledged that some supporters are unhappy with his position, while others agree with his determination to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power. The situation highlights the complex considerations facing the administration as it navigates the sensitive geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker, known as "Streeter," has left his marketing job to make over six figures by reporting idling vehicles through the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. In New York City, trucks and non-city buses are prohibited from idling for more than three minutes. Streeter spends 6-9 hours daily biking and recording idling vehicles, reporting them to the city and receiving 25% of the fines, which range from $350 to $600. While some truck drivers view the program as a "bounty hunter" scheme, advocates argue it addresses a significant public health issue.</p>

          <p>Mark Walter, controlling owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is reportedly set to acquire a majority ownership stake in the Los Angeles Lakers at a franchise valuation of $10 billion, marking the richest transaction in sports history. This move signals a potential shift in the Lakers' approach, with expectations of significant investments in infrastructure, coaching, and scouting, mirroring the Dodgers' success under Walter's leadership. While Jeanie Buss will remain as Lakers governor, the new ownership is anticipated to prioritize sustained championship contention, potentially impacting the team's reliance on aging superstars. The acquisition aims to bring a renewed championship vision and effective championship culture to the Lakers, drawing parallels with the Dodgers' consistent playoff appearances and World Series titles.</p>

Herzog emphasized the need to stop what he termed an "empire of evil" and called for Iran to eliminate its nuclear capabilities. He disclosed that Israel shared intelligence with the U.S. prior to attacking Iran, indicating Iran's plans to produce a nuclear weapon. While Israel has not explicitly requested U.S. military involvement, it would welcome active participation, particularly given the U.S.'s unique capacity to penetrate Iran's heavily fortified Fordow nuclear site, and some analysts warn that U.S. intervention could escalate the conflict and destabilize the region.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law restricting access to gender-affirming care for transgender minors, a decision likely to impact similar laws in other states. In a 6-3 ruling in *U.S. v. Skrmetti*, the court rejected a challenge arguing that the law violated the Constitution's equal protection guarantee. The court found that the law, which prohibits treatments like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender adolescents, does not classify on bases warranting heightened review. The dissenting justices argued that the law discriminates based on sex and inflicts harm on transgender children and their families, and the ruling underscores the ongoing political and legal battles surrounding transgender rights and healthcare access.</p>

The bear was lured into a cylindrical trap, anesthetized, and the lid was cut off, and despite scarring on its neck, the bear was in surprisingly good condition.

          <p>Leading climate scientists warn that the Earth could breach the 1.5C warming limit in as little as three years if current carbon dioxide emission levels persist. The remaining "carbon budget" has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes, largely due to continued record emissions and improved scientific estimates. Last year marked the first time global average air temperatures exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and the current rate of warming is approximately 0.27C per decade. The study emphasizes the urgency of rapid and stringent emissions cuts to mitigate the impacts of climate change, as every fraction of warming avoided will reduce harm and suffering, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <h2>Alzheimer's Drugs Deemed Too Expensive for NHS</h2>

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the NHS (National Health Service) in the UK, despite their potential to slow the disease's progression. NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) concluded that the drugs' limited benefits do not justify their high cost, which could lead to cuts in other essential services. The drugs, while offering a potential delay in the transition from mild to moderate dementia, would require significant NHS resources for administration and monitoring. Pharmaceutical companies involved express disappointment and plan to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Thursday's newspaper headlines are dominated by speculation over whether Donald Trump will order US strikes against Iran. The Metro dubs it "ArmageDon" and reports Iran's threat of "irreparable harm" to the US if attacks are approved. The Guardian notes Trump "keeps world waiting" on a decision, while the Financial Times highlights the US "holds the key" to destroying Iran's underground nuclear sites. The Times reports the UK is weighing military support for the US, while the Daily Telegraph says the UK's involvement "could be illegal."</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved attack plans on Iran but has not made a final decision on whether to strike, awaiting potential concessions from Tehran on its nuclear program. A senior intelligence source and a Defense Department official confirmed that Trump is considering a U.S. strike on Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment facility. Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign. Trump stated that he prefers to make the final decision "one second before it's due" due to the dynamic nature of war.</p>

The court upheld a $1-million jury verdict awarded to Irons in 2022, finding the district negligent in supervising and training its employees. Irons was bullied by three students from November 2017 to June 2018, with the harassment escalating despite her attempts to seek help from school staff. The court rejected the district's arguments, stating that El Segundo had a duty to protect Irons and that school employees did not follow proper bullying procedures.</p>

          <p>The central question of how close Iran is to developing a nuclear weapon is creating a divide between President Trump and his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Trump dismissed Gabbard's testimony that Iran was not building a nuclear bomb, stating that he believed Iran was "very close" to a bomb. This disagreement reflects a broader debate within Trump's "America First" movement over whether the US should intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict. The situation evokes memories of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, justified by warnings of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, which ultimately proved unfounded.</p>
