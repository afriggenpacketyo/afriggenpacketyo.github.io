          <p>Following a 2023 ban by Beijing on its products in critical infrastructure, U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology is reportedly ceasing the supply of server memory chips to data centers within mainland China. The decision comes as the business has failed to recover from the Chinese government's restrictions, which were viewed as retaliation against U.S. tech curbs. However, Micron will reportedly continue to supply chips to China's automotive and smartphone sectors, as well as to Chinese companies with significant data center operations located outside of the country.

          <p>The CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub and brewer, has identified coffee shops and food delivery services like Deliveroo as significant new rivals for consumers' leisure time and spending. This reflects a broader trend of changing consumer habits, including a decline in alcohol consumption, particularly among younger demographics. The company is adapting by improving its coffee offerings and creating more comfortable, food-led environments to attract a wider customer base, while also calling on the government for business rates reform to ease financial pressures.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively working to establish direct export channels for its fresh durians to China, aiming to significantly increase profits by bypassing intermediary countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Currently, these neighboring nations assist with the necessary phytosanitary approvals and cold-chain logistics required by Chinese customs. By improving its own certification processes and infrastructure, Indonesia hopes to capture a larger share of the massive Chinese durian market, which consumes over 90% of the world's supply.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study highlights the dual environmental threats facing major coastal cities like Shanghai, which is experiencing significant land sinking while global sea levels are rising at an accelerated rate. Researchers attribute at least 94% of this rapid urban subsidence to man-made activities, a common issue for delta cities built on soft sediment. The combined effect of these two phenomena poses a severe long-term risk to the city's infrastructure and population, illustrating a critical challenge for urban coastal areas worldwide.</p>

          <p>Chinese retailers have launched the annual Singles' Day shopping festival, the country's largest online sales event, nearly a month ahead of its traditional November 11th date. This early start is a strategic move to boost consumer spending amid a sluggish Chinese economy facing challenges like high youth unemployment and a property crisis. Major e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and JD.com are already promoting deep discounts, hoping the extended sales period will encourage consumers to spend and help revive flagging retail growth.</p>

          <p>In their sole debate, Virginia's incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones clashed over violent text messages sent by Jones, which have become a central issue in the race. Miyares condemned the texts, in which Jones wrote a Republican official should get "two bullets to the head," as disqualifying. Jones apologized for his words, calling them shameful, but pivoted to criticize Miyares for not holding former President Trump accountable for his own incendiary rhetoric.</p>

          <p>China has introduced sweeping new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, critical minerals essential for manufacturing everything from smartphones to advanced military hardware. The move tightens Beijing's control over the global supply chain, where it holds a near-monopoly on processing, and is seen as a significant strategic maneuver in its trade war with the United States. Foreign companies now require government approval to export products containing these minerals, a policy that analysts believe gives China significant leverage ahead of potential trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military strike on Thursday against a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean has reportedly resulted in survivors for the first time in a series of such attacks. This development raises new questions about the U.S. military's rules of engagement and its handling of survivors in these controversial operations. The Trump administration has labeled the targets "narcoterrorists" to justify the use of lethal force, a policy that has drawn criticism from legal experts and lawmakers and has significantly escalated tensions with Venezuela.</p>
