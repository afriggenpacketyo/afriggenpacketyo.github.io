          <h2>Student Loan Forgiveness Through Popular IBR Plan Remains Halted</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 12:57:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has continued its pause on loan forgiveness for the Income Based Repayment (IBR) plan, affecting nearly two million federal student loan borrowers. The suspension, which began earlier this summer, is attributed to legal challenges surrounding the separate SAVE plan, complicating the calculation of correct payment counts for forgiveness eligibility. Lawmakers have urged the administration to resume the legally mandated debt relief, highlighting the financial strain on families awaiting the aid. Experts advise borrowers close to their forgiveness date to continue making payments to avoid being marked as late, with any overpayments expected to be refunded.</p>

          <p>Actor Celia Rose Gooding shared her experience playing a young Nyota Uhura in the series 'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,' which is set a decade before the original show. Gooding, who comes from a family of 'Trekkies,' spoke about the warm reception she has received from the franchise's devoted fanbase for her interpretation of the iconic linguistics specialist. She explained her deliberate choice to remain unfamiliar with Uhura's future storylines to authentically portray the character's journey without foreknowledge of what lies ahead. The role explores Uhura's early Starfleet career, adding new depth and lighter moments to the well-known character.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent, unexplained firings of five senior FBI agents have raised concerns that the dismissals were politically motivated by the Trump administration. Sources close to the agents suggest they may have been targeted for their involvement in investigations related to Donald Trump or the January 6th Capitol riot. Among those fired were Brian Driscoll, a former acting FBI director, and Steven Jensen, head of the Washington field office. Whistleblower attorneys and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the firings as a 'despicable purge' that undermines national security by punishing nonpartisan law enforcement professionals for performing their duties.</p>

The 52-year-old politician was taken into custody at a property in Dumfries earlier this month. Following the arrest, the Scottish Labour party suspended Smyth, and he is now listed as an independent on the parliament's website. He has held several prominent roles within the party, including serving as its general secretary.

          <p>South African authorities have arrested six individuals, including well-known rhinoceros breeder John Hume, in connection with a major international rhino horn trafficking network. The arrests follow a seven-year investigation into a scheme that allegedly smuggled 964 horns, valued at over $14 million, to illegal markets in Southeast Asia. The suspects face charges including fraud, theft, and violations of national biodiversity laws. Conservation groups have praised the arrests as a significant step in disrupting the organized crime that fuels rhino poaching, a practice that has decimated the animal's population across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

The move is seen as part of the Trump administration's broader pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, which has been resistant to calls for aggressive interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>A non-binary park ranger and biologist at Yosemite National Park was fired after hanging a large transgender pride flag from the El Capitan rock formation. The ranger, Shannon 'SJ' Joslin, stated the act was a personal expression of solidarity with the transgender community in response to recent government policies. Park officials cited a failure to demonstrate acceptable conduct and a violation of newly tightened restrictions on demonstrations in wilderness areas. Joslin's supporters argue that the firing sends a chilling message to federal employees and that flags have previously been flown from El Capitan without such severe consequences.</p>

The letter explicitly links this atmosphere to a recent deadly shooting attack at the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta, where the gunman reportedly blamed a COVID-19 vaccine for his mental health issues.

          <p>A military armored tactical vehicle crashed into a civilian car in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington D.C. on Wednesday morning. According to the city's fire and emergency services department, one person was extricated from the civilian vehicle and transported with minor injuries. The vehicle involved was reportedly an M-ATV, a 14-ton armored vehicle designed to withstand roadside bombs and commonly used in war zones. The incident occurs as several Republican-led states have pledged to send additional National Guard troops to the capital, increasing the presence of military vehicles on city streets.</p>

          <p>An op-ed by Taboola CEO Adam Singolda argues that generative AI, despite reducing traditional search traffic, will ultimately create a more valuable and richer era for Google and online publishers. The author contends that while 'zero-click searches' will decrease referral traffic, high-value conversations within AI models like Gemini present massive commercial opportunities. These interactions, involving complex planning for travel, finance, or health, are worth far more than a simple search click. The article suggests that publishers can leverage their trusted brands and deep content to host their own AI conversations, shifting from a pageview-driven model to one based on direct, relationship-driven value.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has strongly criticized a U.S. appeals court decision that temporarily blocked a land transfer required for the development of the massive Resolution Copper mine in Arizona. In a social media post, Trump called the activists opposing the project 'Anti-American,' arguing the mine is essential for the U.S. economy and job creation. The project, a joint venture by mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, has faced long-standing opposition from the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which considers the land sacred and has raised environmental concerns. The tribe's chairman described the proposed mine as a 'rip-off' that would destroy a sacred area.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has turned down an improved bid of £40 million from Newcastle United for striker Yoane Wissa. The proposed deal included an initial £35 million fee with an additional £5 million in add-ons. Despite Wissa reportedly wanting the move and holding talks with Brentford's owner, the club maintains that the offer falls below its valuation of the 28-year-old player. Wissa, a DR Congo international, demonstrated his value last season by scoring 19 goals in the Premier League, making him a sought-after forward in the current transfer window.</p>

          <p>Savers with large cash reserves can still secure compelling returns with certificates of deposit (CDs), despite rates cooling from their recent peaks. An investment of $125,000 can generate substantial, predictable earnings across various terms in the current interest rate environment. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.30% would earn approximately $5,375, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% could yield around $28,550 in interest. CDs offer a safe and stable option for investors seeking guaranteed returns amid stock market volatility, making them an attractive component of a diversified financial strategy.

          <p>A 55-year-old man from Buckinghamshire, England, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a police officer in the leg with a crossbow. The incident occurred in May 2024 when police responded to a neighbor dispute. The man, Jason King, fired repeatedly at officers from an upstairs window before chasing them and striking one officer with a bolt. He also stabbed a neighbor's partner in the stomach. The judge described King as posing a 'significant' risk and noted his actions were like 'trying to hunt down the officer.' Both the officer and the stabbing victim have since recovered.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government plans to paint the entire US-Mexico border wall black, a strategy that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem credited to an idea from President Trump. The rationale is that the black paint will absorb heat, making the surface extremely hot in the sun and therefore more difficult for migrants to climb. The move is part of the administration's broader immigration crackdown, which has seen border crossings plummet in recent months. Officials also state that the paint will help protect the wall from rust, as construction continues at a pace of about half a mile per day.</p>

The breakthrough involves a specially engineered yeast that produces all the vital nutrients, particularly lipids called sterols, that bees need to thrive but are often missing from existing supplementary feeds. This development could be crucial for supporting global bee populations, which are vital for pollinating a majority of the world's leading food crops.</p>

This year's pass rates are expected to be similar to 2024, as grading standards have returned to pre-pandemic levels for a second consecutive year. However, education experts warn that students may face increased competition for places at popular sixth form colleges. This is attributed to a demographic increase in the 16-year-old population and potentially more families seeking state school places. For pupils in England, achieving at least a grade 4 in English and maths is required to avoid retaking the subjects.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that daily reading for pleasure among adults in the United States has plummeted by over 40% in the last two decades. Researchers found that the percentage of Americans who read for leisure on a typical day dropped from a high of 28% in 2004 to just 16% in 2023. This decline is concerning to experts, who note that reading is a health-promoting behavior associated with well-being and improved mental health. The trend is attributed to factors including the rise of digital media distractions, a general decline in leisure time, and uneven access to books and libraries across the country.</p>
