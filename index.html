          <p>Plans for a significant rare earths refinery in East Yorkshire have been canceled after the company, Pensana, opted for more favorable investment conditions in the US. The project was intended to process materials from a large mine in Angola, giving the UK a strategic position in an industry dominated by China. Pensana cited China's artificially low pricing and a lack of sufficient UK government financial support as key reasons for the move, contrasting it with substantial subsidies offered in the US. The UK government expressed disappointment but called it a commercial decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean Sea targeting a vessel alleged to be involved in drug trafficking, but for the first time, officials have reported there are survivors. This marks at least the sixth such strike under the Trump administration's policy of targeting "narcoterrorists," a campaign that has drawn sharp criticism from Venezuela. Venezuelan officials have condemned the strikes as extrajudicial killings of civilians, such as fishermen, and have called for a UN investigation. The White House maintains the actions are legal and effective in stopping drug flow.</p>

          <p>Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Carter Hart is returning to the NHL on a tryout contract after being acquitted of sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident involving former Team Canada World Junior players. The article argues that his swift return, despite the acquittal, highlights a persistent "code of silence" and a pattern of redemption without true reckoning within hockey culture. It draws parallels to other scandals, such as the Kyle Beach case, where involved parties quickly returned to prominent roles. The author contends that legal acquittal does not equate to ethical absolution and that the sport consistently prioritizes business over addressing systemic issues.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire deal in Gaza, President Donald Trump has shifted focus to the war in Ukraine, announcing an upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. Trump stated the summit aims to bring an end to the nearly four-year-long conflict, indicating that "great progress" was made in a recent phone call between the two leaders. To increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is also considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a topic to be discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Kremlin has expressed openness to dialogue while cautioning that providing such missiles would be a "serious escalation."</p>

          <p>An injectable drug for preventing HIV, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning them with Scotland. The long-acting injection, administered every two months, offers an alternative to daily PrEP pills, which can be impractical for some high-risk individuals. Health experts hope this new option will help achieve the goal of eliminating new HIV cases in the UK by 2030. The treatment is intended for those for whom oral tablets are not a viable option, providing a more convenient and discreet method of protection.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that Donald Trump's administration is fostering an "anti-fact ideology" that threatens the principles of objective truth and evidence-based reasoning. It highlights recent decisions by tech giants like Google and Meta to pull funding from fact-checking organizations, such as the UK's Full Fact, and replace them with "community notes" systems that prioritize consensus over verifiable facts. The author argues this shift, championed by figures like JD Vance, conflates fact-checking with censorship and represents a dangerous unraveling of Enlightenment values.

The analysis notes the unique pressure Flagg faces in Dallas, a city accustomed to white superstars like Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Dončić, and playing for a controversial owner.

          <p>European stock markets experienced a significant downturn, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling amid growing concerns about the health of the banking sector. The negative sentiment spilled over from Wall Street, where fears about bad loans led to a sell-off of regional bank and Jefferies shares. European bank stocks were hit particularly hard, sliding nearly 3%, while defense stocks also fell following the announcement of a planned meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin to discuss the Ukraine war. This marks a sharp reversal for the banking and defense sectors, which had been strong performers throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel found that the administration was unlikely to prove a "rebellion" exists in the state, which would be required to justify the action. President Trump has sought to deploy troops for crime prevention in Chicago and to protect federal immigration facilities. The court, however, found insufficient evidence that protests against federal immigration policies amounted to a rebellion or had significantly impeded the execution of federal laws, upholding the temporary restraining order.</p>

Rashford, who is now on loan at Barcelona, had suggested he struggled due to instability at his parent club. Rooney countered that while the environment may not have been perfect, a player's application and effort on the pitch are their own responsibility. He stated that blaming the environment can be an easy excuse for poor performance and that a player's decision not to run more has nothing to do with external factors.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are set to call for accelerated action on utilizing frozen Russian state assets to provide financial support for Ukraine, according to a draft document. The move comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. to seize the assets to address Ukraine's pressing military and financial needs for 2026-2027. The European Commission is exploring how to use the cash balances from about €175 billion in immobilized assets held in Europe. Some nations, particularly Belgium where most assets are held, have raised legal and financial concerns, emphasizing the need for fair burden-sharing with G7 partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations, Samuel Moncada, has strongly condemned the recent series of U.S. military strikes against vessels in the Caribbean, labeling them "extrajudicial executions." He urged the UN Security Council to investigate the attacks, which U.S. officials claim target drug traffickers but which Venezuela alleges are killing civilians, including fishermen from various countries. Moncada highlighted five lethal attacks resulting in 27 deaths and called for the Security Council to reaffirm the principle of state sovereignty. The U.S. holds veto power on the council, making any formal action unlikely.</p>

          <p>Political analysts suggest that Japan's current turbulent and fragmented political landscape could undermine its diplomatic stability and hinder progress in relations with China and South Korea. The ongoing struggle for leadership within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, with candidate Sanae Takaichi seeking to form a coalition to become prime minister, exemplifies the instability. Experts believe that regardless of the outcome, forming a stable government will be challenging. This could weaken Japan's ability to make and keep diplomatic commitments, potentially stalling momentum on important trilateral initiatives with its regional neighbors.</p>

The hardest-hit Alaska Native villages, like Kipnuk, saw extensive destruction, with homes rendered uninhabitable and winter food stores lost.

          <p>The UK government is rolling out a digital identity card for military veterans, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. This new digital ID is intended to make it easier for the approximately 1.8 million eligible veterans to prove their status and access dedicated services like healthcare, housing support, and retail discounts. While physical cards will still be issued, ministers suggest this launch can serve as a case study to demonstrate the technology for a planned mandatory digital ID for all UK citizens and residents by 2029.
