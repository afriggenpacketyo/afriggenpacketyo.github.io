          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 07:20:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, has finalized rules requiring tech firms to overhaul algorithms and age checks to protect children from harmful online content, including pornography and material promoting self-harm. Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's boss, hailed the move as a "gamechanger," although some critics argue the restrictions don't go far enough. Platforms failing to comply face substantial fines, and the rules aim to tackle algorithms that push inappropriate content to young users. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle is also considering a social media curfew for under-16s, pending further evidence. The new rules have been met with cautious optimism from safety experts.
