        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a White House press event with President Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk avoided answering a reporter's question regarding a New York Times report detailing his alleged drug use and family legal issues. When asked about the Times' claims of his ketamine consumption and use of other substances, Musk questioned the credibility of the publication, referencing its past reporting on Russia-gate. Musk's response came as he concluded his work with the DOGE government cost-cutting initiative. The interaction highlighted the ongoing scrutiny of Musk's personal life amidst his public role. Optimism is relatively low given the controversy surrounding Musk's alleged behavior. </p>

          <p>Law enforcement sources are investigating whether a man who allegedly threatened to shoot and kill President Trump may have been framed. Ramon Morales Reyes was arrested after allegedly sending a threatening letter to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. However, authorities are now examining whether the letter was sent by someone else, as Reyes' handwriting did not match the letter. The investigation is ongoing, with the Milwaukee Police Department looking into an identity theft and victim intimidation incident related to the case. The situation raises questions about the circumstances surrounding the alleged threat and the potential for political manipulation.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against President Trump in an attempt to block his executive order that seeks to eliminate federal funding for the public broadcaster. The lawsuit argues that Trump's actions violate the U.S. Constitution and existing laws that protect public television's editorial independence. PBS contends that the president is legally prohibited from interfering with the broadcaster's funding or content. The suit comes in response to Trump's claim that government funding of news media is "corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence." </p>
