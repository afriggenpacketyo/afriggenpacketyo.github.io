            <p>During a White House celebration for the Ohio State University football team's national championship win, Vice President JD Vance nearly dropped the College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy. The incident occurred as Vance attempted to lift the trophy from a table, causing the base to fall to the ground, eliciting gasps from the crowd. Vance, an Ohio State graduate, later joked about the fumble on social media. President Trump hosted the team, recognizing their victory against Notre Dame and receiving a custom jersey from the team captains.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration related to combating antisemitism and diversity policies, leading to a freeze on $2.2 billion in federal grants.

Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.

Bukele made the announcement during a meeting with President Trump at the White House, despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the Trump administration should facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. The U.S. government has conceded that Abrego Garcia's deportation was due to an administrative error, but maintains that he is a gang member, a claim his lawyer denies. The Trump administration now claims it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return him.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs won't lead to a reshoring boom in the U.S. Most companies surveyed said bringing back supply chains could double their costs, leading them to seek low-tariff regimes instead. Over half cited cost as the top reason for not reshoring, and many feel the Trump administration is bullying corporate America. Automation would dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S., and cancellations of orders and consumer spending pullbacks are expected.</p>

            <p>The UN reports that more than 400 people have been killed in recent attacks by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan's Darfur region. The RSF launched an assault on refugee camps surrounding El-Fasher, the last state capital in Darfur held by the Sudanese army. The two sides have been engaged in a power struggle since April 2023, creating a major humanitarian crisis. The UN has verified 148 killings but warns the toll is much higher.</p>

In making this decision, Harvard appears to have learned a lesson from the Trump administration’s tangle with another Ivy League school—just not the lesson the government intended.</p>

            <p>Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and his family escaped an arson attack in the early hours of this morning. The suspect, Cody Balmer, who turned himself in, would have beaten Shapiro with a hammer if he had found him in his home, he reportedly said in an affidavit. The attack is just the latest example of political violence in the United States. These kinds of condemnations of political violence are good. They’re also meaningless—especially when taken in the broader context of Trump’s governing style.</p>

            <p>Amid the biggest shift in the relationship between the two countries in decades, the question is, what does he really want from Canada? Natural resources are another source of dispute. Canada has vast supplies of rare earth metals, gold, oil, coal and lumber – the kind of natural wealth that Trump has long prized. In March, Trudeau accused the US president of planning "a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us".</p>
