            <p>The Trump administration has filed a motion with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging a district judge's injunction and discovery orders in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The Department of Justice argues that the judge's order, which facilitates Abrego Garcia's release from a prison in El Salvador, is unconstitutional and exceeds the Supreme Court's authorization. This marks the second time the DOJ has appealed the judge's orders, focusing on differing interpretations of what it means to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release. The case highlights ongoing tensions between the administration and the judiciary regarding immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>School leaders are grappling with a new Trump administration directive threatening to withhold federal funding from schools with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that are deemed discriminatory. The lack of clarity on what constitutes a violation has led to confusion and varying responses from states. Some states are pushing back against the order, questioning its legality, while others are complying. The situation has created anxiety among educators and raised concerns about the impact on classroom instruction and school programs.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that Google has a monopoly in online advertising technology, siding with the US Department of Justice and 17 states that sued the tech giant. The ruling states Google willfully engaged in anticompetitive acts to maintain its monopoly power, harming publishers and consumers. Google intends to appeal the decision, arguing its ad tech tools are simple, affordable, and effective. This is the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year, following a ruling that it also had a monopoly on online search.</p>

            <p>Shohei Ohtani is on pace for another impressive season, but the Dodgers are looking for ways to increase his RBI opportunities. While Ohtani's home run and stolen base numbers are strong, his RBI production has been limited by a lack of runners on base. Manager Dave Roberts is hoping that the team's bottom-half hitters will improve, providing Ohtani with more chances to drive in runs. Recent performances from Max Muncy and Andy Pages suggest that the offense may be turning a corner.</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant decline, impacting the Dow Jones Industrial Average due to its price-weighted calculation. The decline was triggered by higher-than-expected medical costs in the company's Medicare Advantage plans. The Dow's reliance on per-share price, rather than market capitalization, makes it particularly sensitive to movements in high-priced stocks like UnitedHealth. The event highlights the limitations of the Dow as a comprehensive measure of the overall stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Stanislaus County has agreed to a $22.5 million settlement in a malicious prosecution lawsuit brought by former Modesto defense attorney Frank Carson and his co-defendants. Carson and others alleged that police and prosecutors fabricated charges against them in a murder conspiracy case. The settlement comes after a jury acquitted Carson and his co-defendants in 2019. The case highlights concerns about prosecutorial misconduct and the potential for abuse of power. The large settlement suggests a significant risk that jurors might have delivered a much larger penalty had the case gone to trial.</p>

The investigation reveals dozens of instances where people arrested for minor crimes were deprived of medication and healthcare, leading to death from malnutrition and dehydration. The report sheds light on the systemic failures in providing adequate care for individuals with mental illness within the correctional system. The findings raise serious questions about the treatment of vulnerable populations and the need for reforms.</p>
