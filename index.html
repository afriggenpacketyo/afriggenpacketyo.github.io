          <p>Eighty years after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and their families gathered to remember the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp where tens of thousands died, predominantly Jews, but also Soviet prisoners of war, Sinti, and homosexuals. British and Canadian troops liberated the camp in April 1945, discovering 13,000 unburied corpses and 60,000 emaciated survivors. The camp became notorious due to the intact evidence of Nazi atrocities, including witnesses, perpetrators, and victims, especially as other camps were destroyed or emptied. The anniversary serves as a reminder of the importance of remembering and learning from the past to prevent such atrocities from happening again. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), criticizing the government's evidence linking them to gang activity. The couple, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in 2024, were arrested and had their TPS status revoked based on alleged association with a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The judge, a Clinton appointee, accused the government of lacking meaningful evidence and barred the administration from removing anyone under the Alien Enemies Act in the Western District of Texas without adequate notice. The couple's attorneys stated that their clients should not have been designated as 'alien enemies,' and the consequences of such a designation are drastic.</p>

          <p>A Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operation in Colorado Springs resulted in the arrest of 114 individuals allegedly in the United States unlawfully at an 'underground nightclub.' The operation, involving over 300 officers from various federal and local agencies, led to the seizure of firearms and drugs. DEA officials reported that some active-duty U.S. military personnel were present, some working as private security. Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez clarified that his department's involvement focused on criminal violations, while federal partners handled immigration enforcement. The mayor of Colorado Springs emphasized that criminal activity will not be tolerated in the city.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces conducted an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, targeting what they claimed was a Hezbollah storage site for precision-guided missiles. The Lebanese presidency condemned the attack and called on the US and France to intervene and pressure Israel to cease its attacks. This incident marks the first time in almost a month that Israel has struck Beirut's southern suburbs, an area where Hezbollah is based, and further strains the existing ceasefire agreement. The UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon expressed concern that the strike generated panic and fear of renewed violence. The Israeli government asserts that it will not allow Hezbollah to grow stronger.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating is declining as he nears his 100th day in office, with recent polls indicating that a majority of Americans disapprove of his performance. Approval ratings hover between 39% and 45% across three surveys, marking the lowest approval for a newly elected president at this milestone in more than seven decades. The polls suggest growing skepticism among Americans regarding Trump's actions to transform the government. These ratings represent a significant shift from the uptick in favorability seen upon his return to the White House in January.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Cory Booker staged a sit-in protest on the Capitol steps to voice their opposition to the Republican budget plan, which is central to President Trump's agenda. The Democrats criticized potential cuts to Medicaid and warned of a 'moment of moral urgency' as Congress prepares to work on the legislation. They were joined by other lawmakers and advocates, who shared personal stories highlighting the impact of Medicaid on their lives. The protest underscored the deep partisan divide over the budget, with Republicans aiming to pass it through budget reconciliation, allowing them to bypass Democratic opposition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which were lost in 1710. Investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes confirmed the ships' identities, overturning previous assumptions that they were pirate vessels. The Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, while the Christianus Quintus wrecked in the surf. The discovery provides insights into Denmark's role in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792, although slavery was not abolished until 1847.</p>

ANC National Chair Gwede Mantashe asserted that South Africa is not a province of the United States and will defend its sovereignty. Tensions arose after US President Donald Trump criticized South Africa's new expropriation law, which allows the government to seize land without compensation under certain circumstances, and opened the door for Afrikaaners to be admitted to the US as refugees.

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that President Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by significant changes and continued support from his base, but also growing concerns about tariffs and their impact on prices. The poll indicates that many Americans believe the administration is focusing too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices, which is affecting his approval ratings on the economy and inflation. While most Americans approve of his deportation program, the economy remains a top priority in evaluating his performance. The poll also highlights a partisan divide, with Republicans viewing the changes positively and Democrats expressing frustration and nervousness.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes the Trump administration for ethical transgressions and self-enrichment, accusing the president of breaking norms of good government. Examples cited include pardoning a felon who donated to the Trump campaign, promoting Teslas at the White House, and profiting from a cryptocurrency marketed with his likeness. The author contrasts these actions with past presidential misconduct, suggesting that Trump's behavior surpasses previous ethical lapses. The commentary accuses Trump of personal enrichment, expanding presidential powers, and rewarding donors through pardons and favors.</p>

          <p>A new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll indicates that Donald Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years. The poll reveals widespread discontent with many of his policies and broad economic fears, including the likelihood of a recession. Despite this, he remains more trusted than Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems. Negative views on the economy and concerns about his expansion of presidential powers contribute to his low approval rating.</p>

          <p>With increased volatility in both stock and bond markets, dividend stocks are gaining appeal as a means to balance growth and yield. Investors can choose from over 100 dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including actively managed options like the T. Rowe Dividend Growth ETF (TDVG), which aims to identify high-quality dividend payers. While tech stocks remain significant dividend contributors, investors can diversify their tech exposure through dividend ETFs that don't overweight the sector. Actively managed dividend ETFs are seen as particularly beneficial in volatile markets, offering dynamic adjustments compared to static passive funds. (not investment advice)</p>

However, this practice, when mishandled, can create deadly risks. Aviation experts have warned about the dangers of mishandled visual separation for years, highlighting the need for caution and adherence to safety protocols.</p>
