        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors has adjusted its 2025 earnings guidance, anticipating a $4 billion to $5 billion hit from President Trump's auto tariffs; however, the revised guidance does factor in some tariff modifications made this week, including reimbursements for certain U.S. parts. Despite the tariff concerns, GM CEO Mary Barra emphasized the company's fundamental strength and ongoing growth as it adapts to the evolving trade policy and focuses on EV profitability. The new guidance estimates adjusted earnings before interest and taxes between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, a decrease from the previous projection of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion.

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal, granting the U.S. preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources in exchange for establishing a joint reconstruction investment fund. This agreement, pursued by President Trump, aims to ensure U.S. involvement in Ukraine's future and offset U.S. aid during the conflict with Russia. While the agreement omits a security guarantee sought by Ukraine, it is viewed as a signal to Russia of the U.S.'s long-term commitment to a free and prosperous Ukraine. Ukrainian officials highlight that Ukraine retains control over resource extraction decisions, and the investment fund will operate on a 50-50 basis.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro; Zepbound sales more than quadrupled year-over-year, reaching $2.31 billion. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to a $1.57 billion charge related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The pharmaceutical giant maintained its fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion, which accounts for existing tariffs but not planned levies on imported pharmaceuticals. The FDA reaffirmed its decision to declare the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over, which is the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris faced backlash on social media for an analogy she used during a speech in San Francisco, where she likened Democrats to elephants that circle together for protection during an earthquake. Harris urged the audience to connect with each other in the face of crisis, referencing a video of elephants at the San Diego Zoo during an earthquake. Social media users criticized the digression as bizarre and out of place in the context of her speech, which focused on President Trump's first 100 days in office. The event was hosted by Emerge, an organization that trains Democratic women to run for office.</p>

Marine scientist Vanessa Pirotta noted that shark strandings are becoming more visible through social media and advised prioritizing human safety and contacting environmental authorities in such situations.

          <p>McDonald's reported its largest U.S. same-store sales decline since 2020, shrinking by 3.6% due to bad weather and a more cautious consumer environment. The fast-food giant's overall same-store sales fell 1% across all markets, influenced by comparisons to the previous year's Leap Day. Despite the sales dip, McDonald's earnings per share met expectations, and the company plans to focus on value meals and menu innovations to attract customers. CFO Ian Borden had previously anticipated the first quarter to be the low point for same-store sales, with concerns heightened by President Trump's broad tariffs.</p>

The FA stated that this change was necessary due to a material change in law and science, emphasizing that only those born biologically female will be permitted to play in women's football.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's second term reaches its 100-day mark, his administration's governance style is being characterized by a series of errors and blunders. From mistakenly sending threatening letters to Harvard University to erroneously deporting a Maryland man with a protection order, the administration has admitted to numerous mistakes. These errors are often followed by attempts to either project authoritarianism or walk back unpopular policies. Critics argue that this "rule by error" approach is dangerous and reflects a lack of competence and accountability within the administration.</p>

          <p>As federal research funding declines under the Trump administration, private companies are attempting to fill the research gaps, particularly in areas like women's health. Companies such as Evvy are funding trials, but experts caution that these efforts cannot replace the breadth and depth of federal funding. Cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation have led to canceled grants and reduced research spending. Experts warn that the private market is unlikely to fully compensate for the loss of government-backed basic research, which is critical for drug discovery and public health advancements.</p>

          <p>A new analysis discusses President Trump's shift towards cryptocurrency, highlighting potential risks to the American financial system. Trump's family has invested in crypto-related ventures, and he has expressed a desire to integrate crypto into government and mainstream banking. Experts worry about weakened regulations, the potential for scams, and the lack of underlying value in cryptocurrencies. The piece suggests that these factors could lead to instability and manipulation, ultimately harming average Americans who may not even be involved in the crypto market.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are facing heightened tensions and potential military conflict following a militant attack in India-controlled Kashmir, where gunmen killed 26 people. India has accused Pakistan of backing the attacks, while Pakistan denies any involvement, leading to increased tensions and threats of military action. The situation is further complicated by the long-standing dispute over Kashmir, which both countries claim, and the presence of nuclear weapons. While US diplomacy has played a role in de-escalating past crises, President Trump's involvement remains uncertain, leaving the two countries to navigate the situation independently.</p>

The motive for the killing remains unclear, but Were had claimed that "hired goons" were plotting to assassinate him due to local politics.</p>

          <p>Under the Nazi regime, sport, or rather physical education, was primarily used to promote health and performance for a productive national economy and military fitness. Individual sports were secondary to collective activities, emphasizing strength and fortitude. The Nazis initially rejected international competitive sport, but later used the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin as a propaganda opportunity. While sports were compulsory in Nazi mass organizations, Jews were gradually excluded from sports clubs and associations, leading to the rise of purely Jewish sports clubs until their eventual destruction in 1938.</p>
