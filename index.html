          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is forecast to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean, posing no immediate threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Positioned about 635 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, the storm is moving northeast and is expected to transition into a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating by Thursday. This event marks Fernand as the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which also remained at sea. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which were expected to become hurricanes.</p>

          <p>Two construction workers in China's Shaanxi province found themselves trapped precariously mid-air on a suspended gondola when a sudden and severe rainstorm struck the region. The harrowing incident saw the individuals stranded for approximately 20 minutes, hanging high above the ground amidst the storm. Fortunately, a swift and effective rescue operation was mounted, leading to their safe retrieval and preventing a potentially tragic outcome. This event underscores the inherent risks faced by construction personnel, particularly when confronted with unpredictable and extreme weather conditions in bustling urban environments, and highlights the crucial importance of rapid emergency response protocols in such situations.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel are demanding the immediate release of remaining hostages held in Gaza and an end to the ongoing conflict, blocking highways and rallying near government buildings. Concurrently, Christian leaders in Jerusalem expressed serious concern over the Israeli government's planned takeover of Gaza City, issuing a joint message that fleeing south would be a "death sentence" for many weakened and malnourished refugees. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered immediate talks for hostage release while simultaneously doubling down on plans for a new offensive. Approximately 50 hostages are still held, with 20 believed to be alive, intensifying calls for a resolution.</p>

          <p>Former England and Team GB rugby player Heather Fisher candidly shares her decade-long struggle with alopecia, an autoimmune condition that caused her hair loss following a serious back injury in 2010. She recounts the profound emotional toll, the challenge of accepting her changed identity, and the discrimination she faced, including being mistaken for a man and experiencing physical harassment. Fisher, a 2014 World Cup winner and Olympian, now reflects on how the sporting world has evolved to be more inclusive, partly due to social media. She hopes to inspire others by openly sharing her story, emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>

          <p>Retired Nassau County Police officer Allison Beyerlein, diagnosed with the rare blood disorder AAT, highlights a critical issue with the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program. The program is reportedly stalled in reviewing and certifying new illnesses potentially linked to 9/11 Ground Zero exposures, leaving first responders like Beyerlein without coverage or financial assistance. Despite HHS claims that the process is active, advocates and former Congressman Peter King assert a de facto "communications pause" is preventing new conditions, including AAT and other autoimmune disorders, from being added. This bureaucratic standstill causes immense stress and financial burden for affected responders, who feel the program is failing its promise.</p>

          <p>Japanese authorities offered a rare public apology at the grave of businessman Shizuo Aishima, who died after being wrongfully charged with illegally exporting potentially sensitive industrial machines. Aishima and three executives were arrested in March 2020, with indictments for exporting spray dryers dropped five months after his death in February 2021 due to "doubts" about their guilt. His family accepted the apology at his Yokohama grave, though his wife expressed an inability to forgive those responsible. A Tokyo court previously ruled the indictments illegal, ordering 166 million yen ($1.12m) in compensation and highlighting the inappropriate rejection of Aishima's eight bail requests, which impacted his medical treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report suggests President Trump’s tariffs could significantly reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion and total deficits by $4.0 trillion over the 2025-2035 period if they persist. This "stunning" finding has prompted debate among free-market economists, many of whom traditionally view tariffs as taxes that ultimately harm incomes and compound economic damage. The article highlights how some, like Dr. Richard McKenzie, acknowledge that the *threat* of tariffs could be used to lower those of other nations. Furthermore, it addresses the significant legal question of the President's executive authority to impose such sweeping edicts, a constitutional matter currently under review and likely destined for the Supreme Court.

This massive facility has commenced data collection, with its core being a 20,000-ton liquid scintillator detector housed within a giant acrylic sphere 35 meters in diameter, located 700 meters below ground. Juno's primary mission is to precisely measure the mass of different neutrino types produced by two nuclear power plants situated 53 kilometers away. Particle physicist Wang Yifang hailed the completion and data-taking as a "historic milestone" for this international project, initially proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in Washington, D.C., are pushing back against what they deem unlawful searches and overreach in criminal charges, following President Trump's directive to "clean up" the city. U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui dismissed a weapons case against Torez Riley, calling the search "the most illegal search I've ever seen" and suggesting racial profiling. Newly confirmed U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, however, fiercely defended her office's actions, accusing the judge of routinely releasing dangerous felons. This escalating tension between the judiciary and prosecutors highlights significant concerns about civil liberties and due process amidst increased federal intervention in local policing and the push for maximum charges and detention.</p>

The judge expressed outrage at the Justice Department's handling of the defense and Lake's moves, which he previously ruled violated legal and constitutional safeguards. Lake, however, rejects the judge's authority, asserting that district court judges often overstep, and argues for restoring constitutional checks and balances in this case, which centers on the scope of executive power over federally funded media.</p>

          <p>Patients like Amy Frank are increasingly caught in frustrating contract disputes between hospitals and insurance companies, leading to denied coverage and delayed, stressful care. A recent three-month stalemate between MU Health Care and Anthem in central Missouri left 90,000 patients in limbo, forcing them to navigate complex paperwork for continuity of care or face higher out-of-network costs. Industry observers attribute these growing conflicts to long-standing trends like hospital consolidation, which strengthens hospitals' negotiating power, and rising healthcare costs, potentially exacerbated by federal spending cuts. While the No Surprises Act offers some protection, these recurring corporate disagreements highlight a systemic issue where patients ultimately bear the significant burden and stress.</p>

Slot criticized Newcastle's reliance on set-pieces and long throws, especially after Anthony Gordon received a red card. The feisty match, marked by 32 fouls and underlying transfer rumors, proved a difficult but ultimately successful test of resilience for Liverpool, who "stood strong" despite the challenging conditions.</p>

          <p>UK food price inflation has reached an 18-month high of 4.2% in August, up from 4% in July, primarily driven by significant increases in the cost of chocolate, butter, and eggs.

This uptick reflects global supply costs, seasonal food inflation, and rising operational expenses, compelling shoppers to reassess household budgets. Businesses like Rumsey's Chocolaterie are absorbing most costs but have had to pass some on to customers, with prices up 10-20%, and even remove some products from their menu due to prohibitive production costs.</p>

The situation sets up an unprecedented legal battle over the Fed's independence and marks an early test of Trump's power to reshape the central bank's leadership and influence monetary policy.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is hosting Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Belgian Prime Prime Minister Bart De Wever in Berlin for talks on bilateral ties, foreign policy, European affairs, and international security. Concurrently, Germany's industrial workforce is shrinking, with the auto industry cutting 51,500 jobs in a year due to falling sales, Chinese competition, and the costly shift to electric cars, impacting graduate employment. Separately, a Frankfurt court is set to rule on whether Apple misled consumers by advertising some smartwatches as "carbon neutral," a claim challenged by Environmental Action Germany (DUH) over insufficient long-term guarantees for offset projects. These updates highlight Germany's diplomatic engagements, significant economic challenges in key industries, and legal scrutiny of corporate environmental claims.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Iran of orchestrating two antisemitic arson attacks in Sydney and Melbourne, leading Australia to cut diplomatic ties and expel Iran's ambassador. The Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) concluded Iran's government directed attacks on the Lewis Continental Kitchen and the Adass Israel Synagogue, using overseas facilitators and local criminals. Albanese condemned these "extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression" on Australian soil, aimed at undermining social cohesion. Australia also upgraded its travel warning for Iran to "Do not travel," citing high risks of arbitrary detention, and plans to legislate listing Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization, a move welcomed by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.</p>

          <p>European (E3) and Iranian diplomats are holding last-minute talks in Geneva as a fast-approaching end-of-August deadline looms for Europe to reimpose sanctions on Iran via the "snapback mechanism." European nations are deeply concerned over Iran's nuclear program, which has been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels and cut all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after the Iran-Israel war. The snapback provision allows for swift re-imposition of pre-deal sanctions without a UN Security Council veto if Iran fails to meet conditions like resuming negotiations and allowing UN inspector access. Iran, however, contends there's no legal basis for snapback, claiming the E3 failed to uphold the 2015 nuclear deal after the U.S. exit.</p>

TfL research found that 70% of passengers consider such noise a nuisance, with some finding it very stressful, particularly individuals with heightened sensitivity like those with autism. Posters will appear on the Elizabeth line from Tuesday and across other services from the autumn, accompanied by Instagram posts. The initiative comes as 4G and 5G coverage expands across large sections of the Tube network, which is believed to have increased mobile device usage and associated noise.</p>

          <p>A massive manhunt is underway in rural Victoria, Australia, after a gunman killed two police officers and seriously wounded another during a search warrant execution at a property in Porepunkah. The suspect fled alone, heavily armed, into surrounding forests, prompting residents to stay indoors and public buildings to close. The officers, a 59-year-old detective and a 35-year-old senior constable, were "murdered in cold blood," according to Victoria’s Chief Commissioner of Police Mike Bush, who stated the wounded detective is undergoing surgery for non-life-threatening injuries. This tragic incident, rare in Australia, has deeply affected the police community and led to a large-scale search operation involving hundreds of officers, helicopters, and police dogs.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has evacuated tens of thousands of people in its eastern regions after neighboring India released water from overflowing dams and swollen rivers into low-lying border areas. This diplomatic communication marks the first public contact between the two nuclear-armed rivals in months.

Heavy monsoon rains continue to batter both South Asian countries, raising fears of a repeat of the devastating 2022 floods.

          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its carbon market to include major industries by 2027, three years ahead of its original schedule, according to new guidelines from top policymakers. The plan also mandates setting absolute limits on emissions, a significantly tougher standard compared to the current system that bases caps on carbon intensity. This ambitious move underscores China's determination to meet its climate targets and is expected to invigorate its often sluggish carbon market by spurring demand. The initial expansion this year will incorporate three heavily polluting industries—steel, aluminum, and cement—though they will be subject to less stringent rules during their first two years of inclusion.</p>

He plans to outline his party's proposals to tackle small boat crossings, pledging to detain and deport illegal arrivals. Reform UK's strategy includes leaving the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), repealing the Human Rights Act, and disapplying international treaties like the Refugee Convention to make removals easier. While Labour and Tories criticize the plans as impractical or recycled ideas lacking substance, Farage argues for prioritizing the British people in what he calls a "national emergency." This comes as nearly 28,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel this year.</p>

While Bradley is ranked 11th globally and eighth among Americans, having recently shown strong form, there's debate over whether his participation would be self-indulgent or a valuable asset to the team. The article explores arguments for and against him playing, noting the potential for criticism if the US loses, regardless of his choice, and considering the influence of players who want him to tee up.</p>
