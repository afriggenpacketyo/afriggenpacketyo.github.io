          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 03:10:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are holding back on hiring new employees or replacing departing workers, leading to a decrease in job vacancies. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate slightly increased. This weakening in the labor market is partly attributed to increased employer costs, such as higher National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage. Some businesses may be looking to reduce headcount and slow hiring activity to offset these rising employment costs, potentially causing the unemployment rate to edge higher over the coming year. The rise in average wages has slowed, but it remains above the rate of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union, faces a felony charge for allegedly interfering with law enforcement operations during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. Huerta was arrested after allegedly blocking a vehicular gate to a staging ground for ICE operations and resisting officers' attempts to move him. Following his arrest, Huerta was reportedly injured and hospitalized, later stating that the protest was about resisting injustice against hard-working people. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, with Newsom calling Huerta a respected leader and advocate for working people, while a large protest was held in Washington, D.C. in support of Huerta's release.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's approach involves constant attacks and generating controversy, keeping the media engaged and ratings high, as seen in his disputes with Elon Musk and Gavin Newsom.

Trump has also been involved in multiple other controversial subjects, such as issuing a travel ban, battling elite law firms, and issuing controversial pardons.

          <p>Chinese exports to Southeast Asian industrial centers have increased significantly due to pressure from U.S. tariffs. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have risen by double-digit percentages in the first five months of the year. This shift allows Chinese manufacturers to circumvent U.S. tariffs by shipping goods to Southeast Asia for final assembly and re-export, either for local sale or to Western countries. Factories in Thailand and Vietnam, some invested in by China, produce various items for re-export, such as cars and smartphones, contributing to closer economic and investment relations between China and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>Temu and Shein are increasing their focus on Europe as their U.S. business faces challenges from unfavorable trade policies and increased duties.

However, they are encountering regulatory scrutiny in Europe, similar to that in the U.S., including a proposed customs fee and complaints about unsavory business tactics. These challenges may reshape how Shein and Temu operate in Europe over the next few years, requiring them to invest more in compliance and operational transparency.</p>

          <p>CNN National Correspondent Jason Carroll was briefly detained by police while reporting on the unrest in Los Angeles, and two members of his camera crew were arrested. Carroll was released after being questioned, but was warned not to return to the area. The incident occurred amid reports of journalists being caught between police and protesters, including an Australian correspondent who appeared to be shot by a rubber bullet. A coalition of press and civil liberties advocacy groups has expressed alarm over potential violations of journalists' First Amendment rights during the protests.</p>

          <p>A think tank in Taiwan has initiated a two-day war game, inviting retired U.S. and Japanese generals to simulate the island's defense against a potential military attack from mainland China. The Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation aims to identify urgent defense issues and provide recommendations to the government. The simulation involves retired generals and lieutenant generals from Taiwan, the U.S., and Japan, discussing the feasibility of Taiwan's military strategy in response to a possible use of force by Beijing by 2030. The foundation has not yet responded to requests for interviews.</p>

          <p>Israel is preparing to deport a group of activists, including Greta Thunberg, who were detained on a Gaza-bound aid boat. The activists were taken to a Tel Aviv airport for deportation after their yacht, carrying humanitarian aid, was seized by Israeli forces. Israel has dismissed the vessel as a "selfie yacht" and stated that passengers are being processed to return to their home countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition reported that all campaigners are being transferred into the custody of Israeli authorities, with those refusing to sign deportation documents to be brought before a judicial authority.</p>

The protests were sparked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions in the city, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, particularly among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, increased addiction healthcare access, and more cautious drug use among teens. A study found deaths attributed entirely to fentanyl nearly quadrupled among people aged 15 to 24 from 2018 through 2022, but recent data reveals a 40% drop in fatal overdoses among teens. Despite progress, experts warn that the most at-risk individuals still struggle with addiction, and potential funding cuts could reverse the positive trend.</p>
