          <h2>Police Chief Expresses Shock Over Planned Protest Supporting Palestine Action</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 05:19:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief has voiced his dismay regarding a planned protest in London in support of Palestine Action, particularly after activists recently broke into RAF Brize Norton. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized the importance of the right to protest but questioned the legitimacy of actions supporting what he described as an "organised extremist criminal group." While the Met cannot legally prevent the protest until the group is proscribed, conditions have been imposed to prevent disorder, damage, and serious disruption. The protest is scheduled to take place in Trafalgar Square, outside of the exclusion zone, and is supported by 35 groups. The move to ban Palestine Action has garnered mixed reactions, with some welcoming it and others expressing concerns about the use of counter-terrorism powers to target protests. The incident at RAF Brize Norton is currently under investigation by counter-terrorism police. The author's reflections on the matter are neutral.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for thousands of businesses. The plan, called the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, intends to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses by exempting them from some green energy levies. This scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027. Acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticized the plans, saying the UK needed "a serious approach to energy policy" that "tackles the root cause of our high energy prices". The prime minister said the industrial strategy gave businesses "the long-term certainty and direction" they need to "invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people's pockets".</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of Germans support the concept of a European nuclear deterrent that operates independently of the United States. This support spans across various age groups, regions, and political affiliations, highlighting a rare consensus in German foreign policy. Chancellor Friedrich Merz had previously suggested exploring a joint nuclear strategy with France and the UK, particularly in light of uncertainties surrounding the US. This initiative reflects growing concerns about relying solely on the US for defense in an evolving geopolitical landscape. The author's tone is neutral, simply reporting on the poll results.</p>

          <p>Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), has significantly influenced immigration policy in Washington D.C. for decades. While some view him as a visionary, others consider him an extremist for advocating restrictive immigration policies. Stein promotes the idea that illegal immigration burdens taxpayers, compromises safety, lowers wages, and harms the environment. He supports ending birthright citizenship and has seen his once-fringe ideas embraced by mainstream politics.

          <p>Doug Schoen, drawing on his experience in Serbia, suggests that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites could ignite regime change. Schoen argues that the Iranian government, like Milosevic's regime, is weaker than it appears and faces widespread dissatisfaction. He points to numerous protests and economic struggles as indicators of the regime's vulnerability. While acknowledging the risks, Schoen believes that Israel's actions, combined with internal opposition, could lead to genuine regime change in Iran.

          <p>Trump's recent actions, including military strikes on Iran and crackdowns on immigration, indicate a shift from showman to strongman. His decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites demonstrates a disregard for public opinion and Congress. While some Republicans support his actions, Democrats criticize them as unconstitutional. The strike on Iran was another example of both his disregard for public opinion and his contempt for Congress. The analysis suggests a dangerous turn towards authoritarianism.

The U.S. military operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved multiple aircraft and precision-guided weapons. Iran has denounced the strikes as a violation of international law, while some Israeli politicians welcomed the move. Republicans largely backed Trump's decision, but many Democrats questioned the constitutionality of the action.

Guantánamo can only accommodate about 200 migrants at a time, and some are returned to the U.S. after short stays. Critics argue the administration is trying to scare migrants into self-deporting, while some Republicans support the effort to secure the border.

          <p>The U.S. dollar surged initially as a safe-haven asset after U.S. military strikes on Iran, but analysts warn that these gains may be temporary. Concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and weakening international demand for U.S. assets are expected to regain focus. While fears of a Strait of Hormuz closure contribute to the dollar's strength, analysts suggest the situation is complex. The U.S. Treasury market's muted reaction and ongoing global trade tensions compound these fiscal concerns.

          <p>Prescriptions for the weight loss injection Mounjaro will be available through GPs in England starting today, but only for those meeting strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a phased approach to manage demand and resources, prioritizing patients with a BMI of 40 or over and specific health conditions. Patients will also receive wrap-around care, including regular check-ups and support with exercise and healthy eating. Some GP practices have issued notices saying very few patients on their lists will qualify for the medicine straight away. Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, was initially licensed to help treat type 2 diabetes.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. strikes caused "monumental damage" to all nuclear sites in Iran, citing satellite images as evidence. He highlighted the deep embedment of the targeted structures into the rock, making them shielded from flame. Several B-2 bombers were used in strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities -- Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Trump did not mention which location he was specifically referring to, but said, "The white structure shown is deeply imbedded into the rock, with even its roof well below ground level, and completely shielded from flame." The biggest damage took place far below ground level.</p>

Trump warned that Iran can not have a nuclear weapon and told everyone to immediately evacuate Tehran. The US Secretary of Defence announced that the US was deploying “additional capabilities” to “enhance our defensive posture in the region.”</p>

Foreign-imposed "regime change" is a highly controversial concept. Historically, attempted regime changes in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya have led to instability and violence. The analysis suggests that ground forces would be required for regime change in Iran, and there is no strong rebel movement to topple the current regime.

He also expressed concern over the lack of Congressional approval for the strikes, emphasizing that the Constitution grants Congress the sole authority to declare war.

The decision now rests with the country's national security council, raising concerns about higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Experts suggest that closing the strait would harm Iran more than others, potentially turning neighboring oil-producing countries into enemies. Furthermore, a closure would also provoke Iran's market in Asia, particularly China, which accounts for a majority of Iranian oil exports. The possibility of closure remains "absolutely minimalistic."</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have found evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may affect the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. The scientists monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays, as well as gamma ray-induced particle disturbances known as quasiparticle bursts. The findings could be significant for the scaling of quantum processors and the design of fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection. The scientists said they directly observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors that are induced solely by muons and separated the contributions of muons and gamma rays.</p>
