          <p>President Trump abruptly ended his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, citing escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly the Israel-Iran conflict. White House officials indicated the president's early return was prompted by the need to address the situation, though Trump himself denied it was related to ceasefire talks. He also urged Iranians to evacuate Tehran, adding to speculation about potential U.S. involvement in the conflict. The U.S. has maintained it is not directly involved in Israel's strikes but has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also returning to Washington. The situation has been a focus of the summit, with Trump stating he had "spoken to everybody" regarding Israel and Iran. </p>

          <p>A report by Baroness Louise Casey offers a stark assessment of systemic failures in addressing group-based sexual exploitation, emphasizing the need for significant change. The report criticizes the tendency to blame child victims and highlights decades of inaction despite awareness of the problems. The government has accepted the report's recommendations, yet the challenge lies in translating these into practical, on-the-ground improvements for survivors of abuse. Baroness Casey underscores that past failures to acknowledge and address the issue properly have led to the current state of affairs. </p>

          <p>An explosion at a fireworks factory in Hunan province, China, resulted in at least nine fatalities and 26 injuries, prompting ongoing rescue operations.

China's Ministry of Emergency Management has dispatched a team to oversee the rescue and investigate the cause of the incident, emphasizing accountability.

This agreement follows government intervention to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners, Jingye. The contract is expected to boost domestic manufacturing and supply chains, supporting economic growth and the UK's infrastructure strategy. </p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress to develop a nationwide missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome for America," inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles designed to protect against incoming rockets. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's larger size and the different types of missiles it would need to defend against. Jeffrey Lewis compares the scale of the project to the difference between building a kayak and a battleship. </p>

          <p>President Trump faces multiple options in dealing with the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, ranging from escalating involvement to pulling back. He could bow to pressure from Netanyahu and escalate military action, maintain a middle ground by reiterating the U.S. is not involved in Israel's attacks, or listen to MAGA voices and pull back from the conflict. His decision will be influenced by factors such as pressure from Israel, domestic political support, and his own desire for a deal with Iran. The abandonment of planned talks highlights the challenges ahead. </p>

          <p>G7 leaders have urged de-escalation in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza, but did not explicitly call for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The joint statement, signed by President Trump before his early departure, emphasized Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Iran's role as a source of terror. Trump's early departure and conflicting statements created uncertainty, with speculation about potential US involvement denied by American officials. The leaders' statement amounted to a diplomatic compromise that preserved G7 unity but watered down the statement's impact. </p>
