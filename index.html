          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's economic policies, likening them to those of former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Farage's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown, increasing mortgage costs for families. Reform UK's proposals include tax breaks for married couples and scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which economists have questioned regarding their financial feasibility. A Reform spokesperson dismissed Starmer's comments as a "desperate attack" from a party trailing in the polls. (not investment advice)</p>

The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade of DeepSeek R1 was released on AI model repository Hugging Face. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench, a site that benchmarks models against different metrics. DeepSeek's advancements highlight China's ongoing development in AI despite U.S. restrictions on chip access.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. Global markets responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining strength. The White House has criticized the ruling and has lodged an appeal.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. government would "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is also revising visa criteria to "enhance scrutiny" of all future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move has caused anxiety across university campuses in the United States and is likely to lead to reprisal from China. It is unclear how U.S. officials will determine which students have ties to the Communist Party, fueling worries among the roughly 275,000 Chinese students in the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal court in New York has blocked President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports from almost every country in the world. The court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs. The decision blocks tariffs Trump imposed on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies on China, Mexico, and Canada. Wendy Cutler from the Asia Society Policy Institute suggests this ruling may cause partners to hold off on making concessions during trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese scholar suggests that Beijing should prepare for Washington to adopt alternative pressure tactics in future negotiations, as the Trump administration recognizes the limitations of heavy tariffs. Wu Xinbo from Fudan University notes that while Trump may continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results. Wu suggests that such measures could relate to science, diplomacy, and security. This shift could indicate a more multifaceted approach to U.S.-China relations beyond purely economic measures.

          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has secured the second-most seats in parliament, becoming the head of the parliamentary opposition to the new government. This marks a significant shift in Portuguese politics, breaking the pattern of center-right and center-left parties alternating in leadership roles. Chega's rise mirrors gains by far-right forces across Europe, reflecting a growing trend of nationalist and anti-immigration sentiment. The party, which campaigned under the slogan "Save Portugal," secured 60 of the National Assembly's 230 seats.</p>

          <p>A gas cylinder found at a construction site in eastern Tokyo, where explosions injured 10 people and damaged nearby buildings, had expired in November 1964. The explosions occurred during piling work for a new house in Edogawa Ward, which had been a parking space for about 40 years. Police believe workers drilled into the cylinder, causing the acetylene gas to ignite. The cylinder had a hole measuring about 6 centimeters in diameter and was covered in rust.</p>

The author contrasts this with the scrutiny faced by Muslims and criticizes the lack of attention given to the radicalization of young Zionist men and women.

          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell discusses the dire situation for children in Gaza, where a growing threat of famine is exacerbated by limited humanitarian aid. The entire population of Gaza faces acute food insecurity, with nearly half a million people on the brink of starvation. Without increased access and scaled-up aid, over 71,000 children and 17,000 mothers are estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition in the next 10 months. Russell calls for a return to the functioning U.N.-led aid pipeline, safe and sustained humanitarian access, and a durable cease-fire.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10 percent increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of anticipated negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The company's global production also increased, reaching an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the cost of the tariffs to consumers, analysts believe the company will face pressure to do so if the levies remain long-term. For the full business year, Toyota expects a drop in net profit due to tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>
