          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci, experienced a drop after reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales, signaling potential macroeconomic challenges ahead for the luxury sector. Gucci's sales, which make up nearly half of Kering's total revenue, fell significantly as the brand's turnaround efforts continue, with overall sales in Asia, North America, and Europe declining. Despite these challenges, Kering's CEO expressed confidence in the company's strategic plans and ability to navigate the macroeconomic headwinds, although investors have shown concern over recent leadership changes at Gucci.

          <p>Four veteran Democratic strategists who played key roles in Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential victory discussed the current state of the Democratic Party and potential strategies for its future. The discussion highlighted concerns that the party may be facing a similar existential crisis as it did in the 1970s and 1980s, marked by a disconnect with middle-class and working-class Americans. The strategists emphasized the need for a new offer to voters, suggesting that the party's current message may not be resonating with a broad enough electorate, referencing the loss to Donald Trump as a sign of this disconnect.</p>

          <p>The ongoing antitrust case involving Google and the U.S. government is heavily influenced by the precedent set by the U.S. v. Microsoft antitrust case from the late 1990s. The Justice Department is drawing parallels between Microsoft's monopolistic practices and Google's actions in the search engine market, with the government proposing penalties against Google, including the potential divestiture of its Chrome browser. While the Microsoft case ultimately resulted in a settlement rather than a breakup, it established a legal framework for pursuing monopolistic tech companies and opened the door for new competitors.</p>

          <p>Oil companies, particularly smaller independents in regions like the San Juan Basin, are expressing concerns about President Trump's trade war and its impact on their business. Increased costs due to tariffs on essential materials like polypipe are eroding potential profits, even with the administration's efforts to promote energy production on federal lands. While some local leaders remain optimistic about new pipeline projects, uncertainty and volatility caused by tariffs are hindering long-term planning and investment in the oil patch, creating a sense of limbo for boom-and-bust energy towns.</p>

          <p>Federal data reveals that racial disparities in youth incarceration are at their widest in decades, with Black and American Indian children significantly more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers. Experts attribute this to factors such as disproportionate policing in communities of color and a lack of leniency offered to minority youth. While overall youth incarceration rates have declined, the disparities persist, raising concerns about the long-term consequences for young people of color, including reduced educational opportunities and increased involvement in the adult criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>Construction for a casino resort began Thursday in Osaka at a site close to the venue of the 2025 World Exposition, despite concerns about noise affecting the ongoing international event. The operator and local governments prepare to open the so-called integrated resort, or IR, comprised of a large hotel, conference facilities and gambling areas, on Yumeshima, an artificial island in Osaka Bay, in 2030.
