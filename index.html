          <p>This week's newspaper front pages are ablaze with coverage of Donald Trump's new tariffs, which have prompted Prime Minister Starmer to order an "economic reset," potentially involving tax hikes or adjusted fiscal rules amidst recession fears. Several papers also lead with the arrest of Labour MP Dan Norris on serious charges, including rape and child sex offenses, leading to his suspension from the party. Other stories include the Royal Navy discovering Russian sensors suspected of spying on nuclear submarines and Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood's controversial remarks about fellow judges. The papers also covered jockey Patrick Mullins and his father Willie Mullins for their Grand National win.</p>

          <p>China's economic relationship with Africa is undergoing a transformation, reflecting a significant shift in global power dynamics. While trade between China and Africa increased in 2024, Beijing is moving towards public-private partnerships and engaging financial institutions for project funding, rather than relying solely on government-to-government loans. Trade is also diversifying, with Africa exporting more non-resource goods to China.

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders due to the African nation's failure to repatriate its citizens being deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the government in Juba is "taking advantage of the United States." The move comes as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration and seeks to enforce repatriation agreements with other countries. South Sudan, one of the world's poorest nations, is currently facing political tensions and the risk of renewed civil war.</p>

          <p>A family has been awarded damages after a mother died from cervical cancer due to misreported screening results.

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs represent a dramatic shift away from the free trade policies that have underpinned US economic strength for decades. The move is viewed as a turn towards protectionism, potentially harming global trade and US companies reliant on efficient supply chains. While the policy aims to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, it risks triggering retaliatory measures and undermining the US's global brand image.
