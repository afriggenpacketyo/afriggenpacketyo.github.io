Concerns exist about the lack of a replacement program and the potential for increased foreclosures, particularly given the VA's past errors in handling mortgage relief.

          <p>Stellantis' temporary shutdown of its Windsor, Ontario plant due to US tariffs has caused anxiety among Canadian auto workers.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced retaliatory tariffs on American-made cars. This situation highlights the economic interdependence between the US and Canada and the potential disruptions caused by protectionist trade policies.</p>
