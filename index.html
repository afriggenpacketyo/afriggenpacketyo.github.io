          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new pilot program designed to accelerate the development and integration of electric air taxis, also known as eVTOL aircraft. Managed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the initiative aims to establish new regulations and partnerships to ensure the United States leads in this emerging aviation sector. The three-year program will involve at least five pilot projects focusing on both piloted and unmanned aircraft for cargo delivery and emergency services. This move allows for testing before the lengthy full FAA certification process, with several aviation companies already announcing their participation.</p>

          <p>Lawyers are urgently petitioning a U.S. federal judge to prevent the removal of a group of migrants currently detained in Ghana after being deported from the United States. The attorneys argue their clients face persecution and torture if returned to their home countries, and that at least one has already been sent to Gambia. During an emergency hearing, the judge expressed skepticism about government claims of being unable to influence Ghana's actions, suggesting it may be an "end-run" around U.S. obligations. The court has ordered the Trump administration to detail its efforts to protect the migrants from further deportation.</p>

          <p>Following a historic drought that severely restricted traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is proceeding with significant infrastructure investments to ensure future water security. The plans include a new dam and tunnel project on the Rio Indo to supplement the canal's main water source, Lake Gatun, and a complementary "land bridge" featuring a natural gas pipeline. This land bridge aims to move liquified petroleum gas across the isthmus without relying on the canal's water levels, thereby securing a critical transit route for U.S. energy exports to Asia. These multi-billion dollar projects are designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change on this vital global trade artery.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated along NATO's eastern flank as Romania scrambled F-16 fighter jets to intercept a drone that breached its airspace during a Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. Concurrently, Poland placed its air defense systems on high alert and deployed aircraft in response to Russian drone activity near its border, marking a period of heightened vigilance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described these incursions as a deliberate expansion of the war by Russia, urging Western allies to implement tougher sanctions and enhance collective defense measures.

          <p>The Sikh community, which constitutes a significant portion of the U.S. trucking industry, is facing a wave of fear and harassment following a fatal crash in Florida involving a Sikh driver. The incident has drawn a harsh spotlight on the community, leading to increased scrutiny and reports of drivers being targeted with racial slurs and intimidation at truck stops. In response to the crash, the Trump administration has paused work visas for foreign commercial drivers and tightened language requirements, prompting some Sikh temples to offer English classes. Community leaders worry that this backlash could exacerbate a driver shortage and unfairly stigmatize the entire community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Academics and financial experts are raising concerns that a proposal to remove the £100 limit on contactless card payments in the UK could lead to increased consumer debt. They argue that the current need to enter a PIN for larger purchases serves as an important psychological checkpoint, preventing thoughtless or excessive spending, particularly with credit cards. While proponents, including banks, argue the change aligns with the unlimited nature of smartphone payments and offers convenience, critics worry about the potential for economic abuse and the impact on vulnerable individuals. The debate highlights the tension between payment friction and consumer financial well-being.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated his readiness to impose "major sanctions" on Russia, contingent upon all NATO member countries ceasing their purchases of Russian oil. In a letter to the alliance, he also called for imposing 50% to 100% tariffs on China for its role in supporting Russia, suggesting these measures would create enough economic pressure to end the war in Ukraine. This ultimatum comes amid heightened tensions following Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania. The proposal aims to create a unified economic front against Moscow but faces challenges, as several NATO allies, including Turkey and Hungary, continue to import Russian energy products.

          <p>The long throw-in is re-emerging as a significant tactical tool in English football, with Brentford FC mastering its use to create scoring opportunities.

Brentford has scored seven goals from long throws since the start of last season, far more than any other Premier League team. Pundits and coaches acknowledge its effectiveness, noting that its unconventional delivery makes it difficult for defenses to prepare for, proving that sometimes an old-school approach can still be highly effective.</p>

          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza City have intensified, with a recent barrage of airstrikes resulting in at least 32 deaths, including 12 children, according to medical staff at Shifa Hospital. The Israeli army has been targeting high-rise buildings, alleging they are used by Hamas for surveillance, and has urged the hundreds of thousands of remaining residents to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone in the south. This escalation is part of a broader offensive aimed at what Israel calls Hamas's last major stronghold, exacerbating an already severe humanitarian crisis as many residents are unable or unwilling to leave.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that bullet casings found at the scene of Charlie Kirk's assassination were engraved with messages referencing internet memes, video games, and anti-fascist slogans. One casing included the emoticon "OwO," associated with the furry subculture, while another featured an arrow sequence from the video game "Helldivers 2" used to summon an in-game bomb. A third referenced "Bella Ciao," an Italian anti-fascist anthem popularized by the show "Money Heist." Experts caution against drawing simple conclusions about the suspect's motives, suggesting the eclectic and "extremely online" references may be designed to create confusion and generate viral attention.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin is under intense scrutiny from fans and potentially the board after a 2-0 home defeat to Hearts left the club in 10th place and without a win in their first five league games. The result marks the club's worst start to a season in 47 years, compounding a humiliating exit from the Champions League qualifiers. During a tense post-match press conference, Martin deflected questions about his resignation and acknowledged the challenge of winning over a hostile fanbase. The dismal run of form has created a crisis at the club, raising serious questions about whether he will be given time to turn the situation around.</p>

          <p>An explosion, believed to be caused by a gas leak, has injured at least 25 people at a bar in the Puente de Vallecas district of Madrid. Emergency services reported that two of the victims are in serious condition, and firefighters had to pull four individuals from the rubble. The blast caused significant structural damage, rendering the building unstable and forcing residents of the upper apartments to be rehoused. While authorities have confirmed it was a gas explosion, the exact cause and point of origin are still under investigation. Officials have ruled out the possibility of more victims being trapped.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar residing in border camps. This policy shift is a response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the U.S., which have led to food shortages and rising malnutrition in the camps. The move is intended to allow refugees, some of whom have lived in the camps since the 1980s, to become self-sufficient and support their families. The UNHCR has praised the decision as a potential "regional benchmark" for a rights-based solution to displacement.</p>

Russia denies the abductions, claiming it "rescued" the children. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for President Putin over the matter, and a coalition of 38 countries has demanded the children's immediate return, increasing diplomatic pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>Russia and its ally Belarus have begun their joint quadrennial military exercise, known as "Zapad" (West), at a time of escalating tensions with NATO. The drills are taking place primarily in Belarus, near the borders of Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as in western Russia. The exercises are particularly alarming for neighboring countries as the 2021 Zapad drills were used as a precursor to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This year's event follows a recent Russian drone incursion into Poland, prompting NATO allies to increase their military presence and vigilance along the eastern flank.</p>

However, he stated that it is still unclear whether Russia deliberately targeted Polish territory, a determination that would signify a major escalation. The incident, which prompted Poland to shoot down the drones, was the first time a NATO member has fired on Russian assets during the Ukraine war. Following the incursion, NATO announced plans to bolster its defenses on the eastern flank, while Russia has maintained the violation was unintentional.</p>

Reports about the suspect's background, including that his parents are registered Republicans and that he may have lived with a transgender partner, have complicated early narratives.

          <p>It has been revealed that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer questioned Lord Mandelson about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the U.S. ambassador. The questions were reportedly sent after an initial vetting process flagged the connection, but Mandelson's answers were deemed sufficient at the time. Mandelson was subsequently dismissed from the post after newly surfaced emails showed him sending supportive messages to Epstein after his 2008 conviction.
