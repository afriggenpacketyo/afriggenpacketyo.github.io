          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot, drew tens of thousands to a stadium in Arizona, where he was hailed as a "martyr" and "warrior" by prominent conservative figures, including former President Trump. Key speakers pledged that Kirk's movement would continue with renewed vigor, framing his death as a catalyst for a revival. Kirk's widow, Erika, delivered an emotional speech forgiving the alleged shooter, a message that stood in contrast to Trump's closing remarks where he stated he "hates" his opponents. The event blended religious worship with political rallying for the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>At a memorial service for her late husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk delivered an emotional speech declaring she forgives the man accused of his murder. She stated that forgiveness is what Christ would do and what her husband would have wanted, asserting that love, not hate, is the answer to hate. Contrasting with more combative remarks from other speakers, she emphasized her husband's focus on reviving the American family and urged attendees to embrace faith and prayer. Her message focused on Christian values of love for one's enemies and finding revival in the face of tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The People's Bank of China has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, with the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision was widely expected by economists and comes despite a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The move suggests Chinese authorities are holding off on major stimulus measures, even as recent data indicates slowing export growth and signs of economic fatigue. Policymakers are still anticipated to introduce some marginal monetary easing later in the year to support the government's annual growth target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in the death of one person and injuries to two others. Authorities arrested a suspect, 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, a former employee of the club, who has been charged with second-degree murder. The deceased victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare, who was dining with his family. Officials stated there is no known connection between the suspect and the victims, and the motive is still under investigation, though it is not believed to be a hate crime. Patrons at the venue were praised for their courage in intervening to stop the shooter.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Genetic Switch for Fish Cloacas Was Repurposed by Evolution to Form Fingers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 20:51:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the DNA switch responsible for the development of fingers and toes in four-limbed animals, including humans, originally regulated the formation of the cloaca in fish 380 million years ago. Scientists from the University of Geneva compared the genomes of mice and zebrafish, finding that a key regulatory region next to Hoxd genes controls digit formation in mice but cloaca development in fish. When this region was deleted using CRISPR, mice failed to develop digits correctly, while zebrafish had malformed cloacas. This discovery illustrates how evolution often repurposes existing genetic mechanisms for new functions, rather than creating them from scratch.</p>

          <p>While speaking at the memorial for Charlie Kirk, former President Donald Trump announced that his administration would be holding a news conference to reveal significant findings on autism, stating, "I think we found an answer to autism." He indicated that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would join him for the announcement. Reports from Politico and The Washington Post suggest the administration will link Tylenol use during pregnancy to the development of autism in children. This comes after Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, previously claimed an "autism epidemic" is fueled by environmental toxins, a position disputed by many scientific organizations.</p>

          <p>The ABC10 television station building in Sacramento was struck by gunfire in what police described as a drive-by shooting. While no injuries were reported, at least three rounds hit the building. Local police arrested 64-year-old Anibal Hernandez-Santana, who was later released on bail before being taken back into federal custody by the FBI on a charge of interfering with a radio communications station. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, though it occurred during a week of controversy for ABC over its suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following comments about Charlie Kirk's death. California's governor condemned the act as an attack on democracy.</p>

He also firmly ruled out any future dialogue with South Korea, cementing its status as a permanent enemy.

          <p>A new study from Stanford University projects that worsening wildfires, fueled by climate change, could lead to nearly 30,000 additional deaths per year in the United States due to smoke pollution. Researchers emphasize that wildfire smoke can be significantly more toxic than typical air pollution from fossil fuels, aggravating conditions like asthma and heart disease. The study highlights that these projections are not inevitable but depend on choices made to combat climate change. The warning comes as the U.S. experiences an active fire season, with large blazes burning across at least ten states and drought conditions raising concerns in the Northeast.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance's prominent and faith-focused role at Charlie Kirk's memorial is being interpreted as a strategic move to position himself for a potential 2028 presidential run. By framing Kirk as a Christian martyr and emphasizing his own faith, Vance appears to be courting the young, religious base that Kirk cultivated. This article suggests Vance is methodically building a political profile that merges Trump's populism with a sharp focus on cultural and economic nationalism. His actions, including escorting Kirk's casket and guest-hosting his podcast, are seen as efforts to claim Kirk's mantle and consolidate his status as the frontrunner for the future of the Republican party.</p>

The speech blended eulogy with campaign-style remarks, including a teaser for an upcoming announcement on autism. The event, attended by tens of thousands, featured numerous conservative figures who eulogized Kirk in religious and political terms, calling him a martyr for his faith and the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>An article by a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships identifies nine key things parents do to foster exceptional social skills in their children from an early age. These practices focus on creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection. They include talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, validating a child's emotions, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities rather than failures. The author argues that rather than memorizing phrases, children learn best by observing their parents' behavior, which provides a blueprint for communication, conflict resolution, and building real confidence.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate and prosecute his political adversaries, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. In a social media post, Trump stated, "We can't delay any longer," expressing frustration that "nothing is being done" against individuals he claims are "guilty as hell." The direct pressure on the Justice Department was criticized by Democrats as a step towards authoritarianism and a violation of the department's traditional independence. The call came a day after a federal prosecutor resigned, reportedly for not finding enough evidence to prosecute James.</p>

          <p>An article from western Afghanistan highlights the country's severe hunger crisis through the story of a mother who has buried three young sons, all of whom died from malnutrition in the last two years. The UN warns that aid cuts have led to an unprecedented surge in child malnutrition, placing over three million children in peril. The World Food Programme's funding is set to run out in November, forcing them to turn away malnourished women and children. The crisis is compounded by drought, the forced return of Afghans from neighboring countries, and Taliban policies that restrict aid delivery and hinder international support.</p>

          <p>According to a prominent Chinese analyst, Beijing is considering the construction of a scientific research laboratory at the Scarborough Shoal, a disputed territory in the South China Sea also claimed by the Philippines. Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, suggested that international experts could be invited to conduct coral reef and fisheries research at the facility. The Philippines, which considers the shoal part of its exclusive economic zone, has condemned the potential move as "illegitimate and unlawful." The development signals another potential flashpoint in the ongoing territorial disputes in the strategically vital waterway.</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, calling them "American patriots." The potential sale is mandated by a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has suggested a deal could be finalized in the coming days, which could give some of America's most powerful media figures significant influence over the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the killing of conservative organizer Charlie Kirk, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for Americans to "universally condemn political violence, no matter where it is." Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged a focus on shared values over division. He referenced his own recent experience with political violence, including the firebombing of the governor's mansion in April, as well as other attacks on political figures. Shapiro emphasized the distinction between protected, though sometimes hateful, political speech and illicit incitement to violence, stating that violence leaves lasting scars on society.</p>

In addition to receiving three signed bats and two signed baseballs for the historic ball, Alberto made a special request to play catch with Trout on the field. The three-time MVP readily agreed, creating a memorable moment for the fan and his family long after the game had ended. Trout, who became the 59th MLB player to reach the 400-homer mark, acknowledged the significance of the experience, relating it to his own childhood memories of attending games with his father.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were crucial in a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, damaging the Mets' playoff hopes. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch with his foot to rob Brett Baty of an extra-base hit after the ball was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the top of the fence to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez. The loss dropped the Mets into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wildcard spot.</p>

While the storm is not projected to make a direct landfall, swells generated by Gabrielle are forecast to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward.

In an interview with the BBC, Lee argued that with North Korea producing 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually, a freeze represents a "feasible, realistic alternative" for now, provided the long-term goal of denuclearization is not abandoned. This pragmatic stance reflects a shift in policy aimed at reducing tensions and re-engaging Pyongyang, which has rejected all talks since 2019.</p>

The article follows the story of a young woman who, after being diagnosed at 13, can no longer walk or talk. A 2007 study identified a "cluster" of DRPLA cases in the region, which was previously thought to primarily affect people of Japanese descent. Symptoms include memory loss, seizures, and loss of motor control. Families are connecting through social media to share information and support, as they navigate a condition that is often poorly understood by local medical professionals.</p>

He asserted that Harris lost every swing state and the popular vote, and he believes her political career is now "over."

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan to bring a second runway into regular use at London's Gatwick Airport. The project involves shifting the existing northern runway to allow for simultaneous operations, which could increase the airport's annual flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. The government has framed the decision as a "no-brainer for growth," while the airport claims it will create jobs and boost the economy. However, the expansion faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate emissions.</p>
