          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. This move is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without a real increase in income. The adjustments mean Americans will need to earn more before moving to a higher tax rate, providing potential relief. The article details the new standard deduction amounts for various filing statuses and explains how the progressive tax system works. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the 2025 recipient, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, publicly thanked Trump for his "decisive support" in her efforts to promote democracy in her country. Trump reportedly congratulated Machado on her win, even as his administration criticized the Nobel Committee's decision.

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is now in effect, with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along agreed-upon lines within Gaza. This marks the first phase of a broader peace deal, which triggers a 72-hour countdown for the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas. In exchange for the hostages, Israel is set to release over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The agreement also includes provisions for increased humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip, though specific details are still being finalized.</p>

With average HELOC rates falling to around 7.84%, it has become a more affordable borrowing option compared to previous months. The analysis provides specific monthly payment estimates for 10-year and 15-year repayment periods, highlighting the potential savings due to declining rates. It also advises borrowers to calculate payments under various rate scenarios due to the variable nature of HELOCs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a major policy promise ahead of the next Senedd election, offering universal free childcare for children from nine months to four years old. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth presented the plan as a "transformative" policy to assist families with living costs, aiming to provide at least 20 hours of care for 48 weeks a year by 2031. The proposal aims to be the most generous childcare offer in the UK and is a key part of the party's platform to replace Labour as the governing party in Wales.</p>

          <p>This article explores the legal rights of creditors to sue retirees over outstanding credit card debt, confirming that age or retirement status does not provide immunity from lawsuits. While creditors can obtain judgments, federal law generally protects Social Security benefits from garnishment by credit card companies. However, other forms of retirement income or assets, such as pensions or property, may be vulnerable depending on state laws. The article advises retirees facing such lawsuits to respond and explore options like negotiation or credit counseling. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue this represents an unprecedented use of the Justice Department as a tool for political retribution, shattering post-Watergate norms of law-enforcement independence.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose "massive" new tariffs on Chinese imports in response to Beijing's recent move to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals. These materials are critical for numerous high-tech American industries, and Trump accused China of a "hostile" attempt to hold the world captive. The renewed trade tensions caused a sharp drop on Wall Street, raising fears of another damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The proposal has faced significant backlash from civil liberties groups, who label the scheme "Orwellian" and warn of potential mass surveillance.

          <p>A group of U.S. senators has launched an inquiry into four major government contractors, including Deloitte, over persistent errors in the Medicaid eligibility systems they build and manage. Citing reports of people erroneously losing health coverage due to technological failures, the senators expressed concern that these issues will be exacerbated by new work requirements. The inquiry demands information from the companies about their contracts, potential financial incentives for removing enrollees, and lobbying expenditures. The systems, largely funded by taxpayers, are critical for determining benefits for over 70 million Americans.</p>

          <h2>Federal Employees Receive Final Partial Paycheck as Government Shutdown Continues</h2>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown approaches its third week, federal workers have received a partial paycheck that will be their last until funding is restored. With Congress deadlocked, hundreds of thousands of employees are now facing financial uncertainty. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized Senate Democrats for blocking a Republican funding proposal, warning that military personnel are also set to miss their next paycheck if the impasse continues. The shutdown's impact on government workers and services is intensifying as both parties remain entrenched in their positions over the spending bills.</p>

          <h2>Report Indicates a Worrying Rise in Homelessness Across the European Union</h2>

          <p>A new report from Feantsa, a European federation of homelessness organizations, reveals a significant and "worrying" increase in homelessness across the EU. The trend is attributed to a widespread housing crisis, with rising rents making housing unaffordable for many low-income households. Germany reported the highest absolute number of people without permanent shelter, while the Czech Republic has the highest rate proportional to its population. The findings cast doubt on the EU's goal of ending homelessness by 2030, as the problem appears to be worsening in many member states.</p>

          <p>New U.S. government fees on Chinese-made and Chinese-operated freight vessels are set to take effect, creating widespread confusion and concern within the shipping industry. Ocean carriers are scrambling to understand how the rules will be applied, particularly regarding vessels financed by Chinese leasing firms, which could subject them to significant financial penalties. The fees are part of the escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which has already enacted retaliatory fees on U.S.-flagged ships. The uncertainty is prompting some carriers to seek refinancing to avoid any links to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article clarifies a key regulation in U.S. bankruptcy law known as the "two-year rule" for individuals filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy for a second time. The rule states that to receive a discharge of debts in a new Chapter 13 case, it must be filed at least two years after the filing date of a previous Chapter 13 case. Crucially, the waiting period is measured from filing date to filing date, not from the date the first case was discharged. Misunderstanding this timing can result in a filer completing a second repayment plan without having their debts ultimately wiped out.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled the environmental review for the Esmeralda 7 solar project in Nevada, effectively halting what would have been one of the world's largest renewable energy installations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) updated the project's status to "cancelled" without providing an explanation. This action follows an executive order from President Trump to pause new renewable energy authorizations on federal land and the appointment of an oil industry advocate to lead the BLM. The move signals a broader administration policy targeting not just wind power but all forms of renewable energy development.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops have been seen on patrol in Memphis, Tennessee, as part of a controversial federal task force initiated by President Trump. While local authorities state the troops will be used in "retail corridors," the deployment is part of a broader, legally contested effort to send federalized forces into U.S. cities. The move has faced legal challenges, with courts blocking a similar deployment in Portland, Oregon. The administration justifies the action as a response to "leftwing domestic terrorism," while opponents accuse the president of misusing the military for political purposes.</p>
