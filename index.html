          <p>Valentino Luchin, a 62-year-old distinguished chef from San Francisco, has been arrested for allegedly robbing three banks in a single day, a shocking development for the Bay Area culinary scene. Authorities state Luchin passed notes demanding money to tellers at separate locations within the city's Central District before fleeing with cash. This is not his first encounter with such charges; in 2018, he admitted to robbing a bank, citing severe financial struggles after his Walnut Creek restaurant closed in 2016. Luchin is currently being held on multiple charges of robbery and attempted robbery, leaving the community to grapple with the downfall of a once-prominent figure.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that for the first time since the Cold War, the world is between established orders, with geopolitical momentum shifting decisively towards Beijing. The article cites recent events like Kenya's de-dollarization towards the yuan, Slovakia securing Chinese rare earths despite EU pressure, and progress on the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline as evidence of China's growing global influence. While China faces its own economic challenges, such as slowing export growth, its ability to forge new partnerships and advance major strategic projects indicates its moment to rewire the world may be arriving, challenging the long-standing Western-led framework.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a framework deal with China that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, narrowly avoiding a nationwide ban. The agreement comes after a 2024 law required the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. operations due to persistent national security concerns over data access and the potential for propaganda dissemination. While specific terms of the deal remain confidential, officials have confirmed that any final agreement would necessitate a sale to a U.S.-based owner to address these security risks. President Trump is expected to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to finalize the crucial details of the arrangement.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has linked the gruesome murder of a Dallas motel manager to the Biden administration's immigration policies, after the suspect, a Cuban national, was not deported despite a prior arrest history. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, is in custody for capital murder with an immigration hold. ICE confirmed he was under a final deportation order, but Cuba would not accept him, leading to his release under supervision during the final days of the prior administration. Trump used the tragic incident to advocate for stricter immigration enforcement and his platform of enhanced border security.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the White House is requesting an additional $58 million in security funding from Congress for the executive and judicial branches. The request comes amid heightened security concerns following the shooting and previous assassination attempts on President Trump, highlighting the increasing pressure on the U.S. Secret Service to adapt its protective measures. The funds would be added to a continuing resolution needed to avert a government shutdown at the end of the month.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military, on his orders, conducted a strike that destroyed an alleged Venezuelan drug trafficking boat in international waters, resulting in three deaths. The action is the second such "kinetic strike" against what the administration terms "violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists," signaling a highly aggressive U.S. posture in the Caribbean. The announcement has escalated tensions with Venezuela, whose president, Nicolás Maduro, has condemned the U.S. actions as "aggression." Legal experts have also raised concerns that such lethal strikes in international waters may violate international law.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded a combined $13.6 million to five women who were sexually assaulted by their former high school teacher, Garry Poe, in the 1980s. The lawsuit found the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District negligent for failing to prevent the abuse that spanned years. The women testified that Poe, a longtime English teacher and coach, groomed them at Rolling Hills High School before assaulting them during post-graduation European trips he chaperoned. The significant verdict holds the school district financially and morally accountable for not addressing the teacher's predatory behavior and protecting its students.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors is proposing a new 10-year compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth approximately $900 billion, potentially making him the world's first trillionaire.

This proposal comes as Musk's attention is divided among his various companies and political activities. The board argues the "one-of-a-kind compensation" is necessary to incentivize Musk to dedicate his talents to Tesla, reflecting a belief that his presence is critical to the company's ambitious growth targets.

Despite spending £200 million on forwards, the team has struggled to score, marking its worst league start since the 1992-93 season. Scholes argues the priority should have been a controlling central midfielder and that the current squad lacks the quality to properly execute Amorim's tactics. Despite growing external pressure and poor results, senior club officials reportedly remain supportive of the manager's long-term vision for the team.</p>

          <p>The Senate is scheduled to vote on President Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, just ahead of the central bank's meeting to discuss interest rates. Miran, who currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisors, has stated he would take an unpaid leave of absence rather than fully resign if confirmed for the short term. This has intensified concerns among critics about the Federal Reserve's political independence, particularly as Trump has been publicly pressuring the institution to slash rates to boost the economy.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed five new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel he purged of previous appointees in June. The new members, including a pharmacist and an epidemiology professor who has questioned government COVID risk assessments, will join the panel just before a meeting to decide on recommendations for fall COVID-19 boosters. The complete overhaul of the influential committee has drawn sharp criticism from major medical organizations, who express deep concern that the panel's future guidance may be based on political ideology rather than established scientific expertise.</p>

          <p>Reverend William Barber, a prominent progressive pastor and social activist, has condemned the "brutal, ugly" assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk while also calling for a broader rejection of all political violence. Speaking at an event commemorating the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, Barber appeared to critique the right-wing "religious nationalism" espoused by Kirk and others, warning against using religion to "sanctify wrong" or as a cover for injustice. He challenged the narrative that political violence comes only from the left, urging his audience to stand against violent rhetoric in all its forms.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, with voters overwhelmingly citing the city's unaffordability as their top concern. The poll suggests a strong desire for a candidate who can bring change over one with experience, which benefits Mamdani. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo performs better among the smaller group of voters focused on crime. The influence of President Trump is also a notable factor, as many voters, particularly Mamdani's supporters, want a mayor who will oppose the president. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trails significantly.</p>

The recall notice affects bottles sold in several Midwestern states between April and August 2025. Reflecting the severity of the danger, the company is advising customers not to return the product to stores. Instead, they are instructed to dispose of the bottles safely by carefully wrapping them and placing them in the trash, after which they can visit a store to receive a full refund for the faulty product.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis suggests that while crime rates in Washington, D.C. appear to have declined during the recent deployment of federal forces, the crackdown may be counterproductive in the long term. The surge is reportedly having a negative economic impact on the city, with restaurant traffic and tourism down, and may be eroding the crucial trust between the community and local police. Experts worry that once the federal presence is withdrawn, the disruption to community life and the poisoning of police-community relations could lead to a resurgence of the very disorder the deployment claimed to combat.</p>

The rebound follows a period of slumping sales attributed to an aging product line, increased competition, and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities. In recent weeks, investor sentiment has improved, boosted by a proposed new pay plan for Musk, the rollout of new MegaBlocks battery storage systems, and a recent $1 billion stock purchase by Musk himself, signaling renewed confidence.

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semiannual schedule, a change that would require SEC approval. In a social media post, Trump argued the move would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. This revives an idea he floated during his first term, which aligns with proposals from figures like Warren Buffett who have criticized the unhealthy focus on quarterly results. The proposal contrasts with the current system, which is valued by many investors for its transparency and timeliness. (not investment advice)</p>

The purchase comes as shareholders are set to vote on a new, potentially massive pay package for Musk and as the company's stock continues to recover from a slump earlier in the year.
