          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that the Trump administration's tariff reprieve is a positive step, but further changes are necessary to bolster the U.S. auto industry. While the new actions reimburse automakers for some U.S. parts and reduce the stacking of tariffs, Farley emphasized the need for a comprehensive set of policies to support the shared vision of a healthy and growing auto industry. He highlighted that ongoing collaboration with the administration is essential to achieve this goal, particularly amid regulatory uncertainty surrounding tariffs on imported vehicles. Farley made these remarks during a launch event for the 2025 Ford Expedition in Kentucky.</p>

Despite the setback, Stefanik has garnered increased support from top GOP donors and remains resilient, viewing the situation as a twist in her political career.

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of the year, with GDP falling by 0.3%, as consumers and businesses stocked up on imports ahead of President Trump's tariffs. The contraction was partly attributed to a 41% boost in imports and a drop in consumer sentiment, triggering fears of a recession. Some economists noted that the decline was largely due to the oversized amount of imports that American businesses purchased in anticipation of Trump’s tariffs. Trump blamed his predecessor for the economic woes, despite data showing strong growth when he took office.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, driven by tariff-induced noise and policy shifts, though underlying economic growth remained solid. Consumers and businesses adjusted spending patterns in response to President Trump's trade policies, contributing to the decline in GDP. Economists predict a slowdown in spending and investment in the coming months as tariffs drive up prices and uncertainty persists. The article notes that inflation cooled in March, but the long-term impact of tariffs on prices remains uncertain.</p>
