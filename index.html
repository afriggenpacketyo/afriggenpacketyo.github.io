          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to pursue a new venture as a founder. His departure comes as GitHub faces increasing competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools, often called "vibe coding," from startups like Anysphere, Replit, and Windsurf. While GitHub's AI tool, Copilot, continues to grow, with 20 million users reported, these emerging competitors are gaining traction among developers. Dohmke will remain with the company through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition, with GitHub now operating under Microsoft's CoreAI division.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he personally negotiated a deal with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, requiring the company to pay the U.S. government 15% of its revenue from H20 chip sales to China. Trump stated he initially demanded a 20% share but settled for the lower figure after negotiations. He characterized the H20 chip as "obsolete," suggesting it poses no national security threat because China already possesses similar technology, and noted that more advanced chips like Blackwell would not be approved for sale without significant performance reductions. This arrangement was a condition for granting export licenses allowing Nvidia to resume sales to the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for an additional 90 days. The order was signed just hours before a pause on the tariffs was set to expire, which would have caused U.S. duties on Chinese imports to return to their peak levels from April. This extension was the anticipated result of recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. The move continues a temporary truce in the trade war between the two economic powers, which began after an initial 90-day pause was agreed upon in May.</p>

          <p>Sports pundit Skip Bayless strongly criticized NFL teams following rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders' impressive preseason debut for the Cleveland Browns. Bayless asserted that teams who passed on Sanders, allowing him to be drafted in the fifth round, were "petty fools" and, in some cases, "racist fools." He argued that the league wanted to teach a lesson to Shedeur and his father, Deion Sanders, due to their public personas. Bayless praised Sanders' performance, stating it shamed the teams that had 143 opportunities to select him before the Browns finally did.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act to place the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control, citing a need to address violent crime. The 1973 act grants the president temporary authority over the city's police for federal purposes, a move that will be overseen by the Attorney General. This decision has been met with strong opposition from Democratic leaders and D.C. officials, who call it an assault on local governance and point to statistics showing a recent decline in violent crime. Conversely, Republican lawmakers have supported the action as a necessary step to restore safety in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a British researcher who disappeared in Antarctica in 1959 at age 25, have been discovered near a receding glacier. Bell, a meteorologist, fell into a crevasse during a survey and his body was never recovered. A Polish research team found his remains along with over 200 personal items, and his identity was confirmed through DNA analysis. His surviving brother expressed shock and gratitude for the discovery, which brings closure to a 66-year-old mystery. The finding is part of a growing trend of discoveries as melting glaciers around the world expose long-lost individuals.</p>

          <p>The stock market has shown a muted reaction to the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their AI chip sales to China. Investors appear to view the agreement as a net positive, as it restores access to the lucrative Chinese market, which had been cut off by stricter export controls. Analysts suggest that earning 85% of potential revenue is preferable to earning nothing and that maintaining a competitive presence in China prevents ceding the market entirely to local competitors. While the fee represents a significant sum, it is considered manageable relative to Nvidia's massive projected revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UN Condemns Israeli Airstrike That Killed Six Journalists in Gaza</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations human rights office has condemned a targeted Israeli airstrike in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of six journalists, including five from Al Jazeera. The attack, which killed prominent correspondent Anas al-Sharif, was labeled a grave breach of international law. Israel's military claimed it targeted Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim he had denied and for which Israel has provided little public evidence. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation from media rights groups and has intensified calls for an independent investigation and for the protection of journalists working in the conflict zone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals that approximately 73% of U.S. adults have experienced at least one form of online scam or cyberattack. The most prevalent schemes include credit card fraud, online shopping scams, and ransomware attacks. Cybersecurity experts warn of newer tactics, such as fraudulent calendar invitations that automatically appear on a user's schedule and multi-factor authentication attacks designed to overwhelm users into granting access. To protect against these threats, experts advise changing calendar settings to prevent automatic updates, being cautious with unsolicited attachments, and using authenticator apps that provide codes rather than simple approval prompts.</p>

          <h2>July Inflation Report Expected to Show Acceleration Driven by Tariff Pressures</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July is anticipated to show that inflation rose at a faster annual rate compared to June, with headline CPI expected to reach 2.8%. Economists predict that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, will also tick up to 3.0%, its strongest gain in six months. Analysts believe these figures will show further evidence of President Trump's tariffs pushing up consumer prices, particularly for goods like apparel and furniture. Despite the inflationary pressure, markets are still anticipating that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates in September due to concerns about the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall over the weekend has caused severe flash flooding across several Midwestern states, resulting in at least one death in Nebraska, widespread power outages, and numerous road closures. The Milwaukee area was hit particularly hard, with some areas receiving up to 14 inches of rain, a potential state record. Emergency crews in Milwaukee conducted dozens of water rescues as motorists became stranded in their vehicles. The flooding forced the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair and a USA Triathlon national championship event. Officials are warning residents to avoid standing water as cleanup efforts continue.</p>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally following a report that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less-dangerous drug category under federal law. Trump later confirmed he is looking into the matter and expects to make a determination within weeks. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III would ease tax burdens on cannabis companies and likely encourage institutional investment. Industry leaders expressed optimism that a reclassification would be a "gamechanger" for the market, although the final authority for such a change rests with the Attorney General and the DEA.</p>

While only a small number of households still use the service, its distinctive screeching connection tone and the "You've Got Mail" greeting are memorable parts of internet history.

The FCA clarified that no official scheme is in place yet and that it would never ask for personal banking details over the phone.

He described the October 7 attack as "evil" but argued that Israel's subsequent military response has become disproportionate and morally indefensible, particularly the use of starvation as a weapon. While affirming Israel's right to exist, Bono called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and condemned Prime Minister Netanyahu's far-right government for its brutal actions.
