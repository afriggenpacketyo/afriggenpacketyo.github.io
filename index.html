          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. successfully made weight for his middleweight fight against Conor Benn, avoiding a second fine after initially missing the mark by a small margin the previous day. Both fighters adhered to a rehydration clause, ensuring they didn't exceed a weight limit on the day of the fight. This match is highly anticipated, occurring over three decades after their fathers' famous rivalry, though a previous attempt to schedule the fight in 2022 was canceled due to Benn failing a drugs test. Both fighters are expected to earn seven-figure purses for this contest.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in multiple states have blocked the Trump administration's attempts to dismantle Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs in schools, citing concerns over academic freedom and the vagueness of the administration's directives.

Judges also expressed concern that the administration's actions could stifle discussions about race and history, potentially leading to a chilling effect on teachers and schools.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, shortly after his sentencing for tax crimes. Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, played a role in efforts to publicize Ashley Biden's diary during the 2020 presidential election. The pardon has raised eyebrows given Fago's involvement in attempts to undermine Joseph R. Biden Jr., adding a layer of political intrigue to the case.</p>
