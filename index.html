          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pressing the Trump administration to implement a tariff exclusion process to prevent a recession and protect small businesses from irreparable harm. In a letter to key trade officials, the Chamber requested automatic tariff exemptions for small business importers and products not domestically available. Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark emphasized the urgency of relief for businesses facing survival threats due to tariffs. The White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller suggested that tax cuts would be the primary relief for small businesses, indicating a lack of interest in short-term tariff relief.</p>

          <p>Nvidia and Anthropic are publicly clashing over U.S. artificial intelligence policy, specifically regarding chip export restrictions to China. Anthropic argued for stricter controls, claiming Chinese smuggling tactics involve hiding chips in various ways, while Nvidia countered that American firms should focus on innovation instead of such claims. The "AI Diffusion Rule," set to take effect May 15, imposes global export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent China from advancing in AI. President Trump is reportedly considering updates to these restrictions, adding uncertainty to the policy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is scrutinizing the $2.5 billion Federal Reserve building renovation, deeming the price tag suspiciously high. Musk, an initiator of the Department of Government Efficiency advisory board, suggests the cost overruns should be examined as part of a broader effort to reduce government waste. The Fed initiated the project in 2021 with an initial budget of $1.9 billion, but rising material costs, construction delays, design changes, and site problems have driven up expenses. The renovation aims to address upgrades, building codes, technology updates, and energy efficiency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly collaborating with local law enforcement to accelerate deportations, exemplified by a six-day immigration sweep in Florida that resulted in over 1,100 arrests. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers partnered with Florida state agencies, marking one of the agencyâ€™s largest operations in a single state. ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan stated this approach would be implemented nationwide to enhance enforcement capabilities. The agreements are part of the 287(g) program, enabling local law enforcement to assist federal officials in immigration enforcement, with a recent expansion granting them authority to make immigration arrests.</p>

          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant U.S. sales increases in April as consumers rushed to buy vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. This "tariff fear-buying" was supported by automakers offering discounts or promising to hold prices steady. However, demand slowed in late April due to tighter inventories and rising prices, according to J.D. Power and Cox Automotive. While automakers benefited from the consumer rush, the higher costs and lower vehicle inventories may lead to lower sales in the future.</p>

The board argues that Trump is attempting to establish a presidency unrestrained by Congress or the courts, undermining constitutional checks and balances. The editorial emphasizes the need for a broad coalition of Americans to defend democratic principles, while acknowledging Trump's legitimate election and the legality of some of his policies. The piece outlines five pillars of American democracy that the board believes Trump has attacked: separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected approximately $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, retaining the funds. This practice has provided a new revenue source for the county, coinciding with increased state funding for border operations. County officials defend the forfeitures as a deterrent to illegal crossings, arguing that migrants bear responsibility for their inability to attend court. However, critics argue that deporting migrants before their court dates and then forfeiting their bail is unjust, as the bail is meant to be returned if the defendant appears in court.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has experienced a significant reduction in personnel, with over 70% of attorneys leaving, being reassigned, or accepting deferred resignation offers since January. This decline comes as the Trump administration aims to reshape the division's focus, prioritizing voter fraud investigations and limiting transgender rights. Current and former employees emphasize that the departures effectively hinder the division's ability to enforce civil rights statutes. Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the division, has celebrated the reduction in attorneys, stating that the division's role is to enforce federal civil rights laws, not "woke ideology."</p>

Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple Vice President of Finance Alex Roman "outright lied" about when Apple decided to levy a 27% fee on certain App Store purchases. Rogers referred the matter to U.S. attorneys to investigate potential criminal contempt proceedings against Roman and Apple. The decision is a significant rebuke of Apple's conduct in the original trial, which was decided in 2021 and appealed in 2023.</p>

This applies to ETFs structured as trusts, including popular gold funds like SPDR Gold Shares and iShares Gold Trust.
