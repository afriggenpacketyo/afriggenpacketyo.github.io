          <p>Arch Manning, the highly touted quarterback for the top-ranked Texas Longhorns, faced significant criticism on social media following a challenging game against Ohio State. In the 14-7 loss, Manning struggled, completing only 17 of 30 passes and throwing a costly interception. The performance was a stark contrast to the high expectations for the top recruit, leading to widespread online commentary about his readiness for high-pressure games. The article notes that despite this tough outing, Texas has a series of more manageable games ahead, offering Manning a chance to rebound.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid concerns about a potential deployment of federal agents by the Trump administration. The order seeks to prevent city police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement and "demands" the administration refrain from deploying armed forces in the city. It also includes provisions urging federal agents to wear identifying information and body cameras, while prohibiting masks. The move is a preemptive measure to resist what the mayor and other local officials describe as an unconstitutional overreach and an attempt to sow disorder.</p>

          <p>This article details the conditions and controversies surrounding a temporary immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," as it prepares to shut down following a judge's order. It shares the stories of two detainees' families who allege their loved ones faced severe medical neglect and were difficult to locate within the system. The facility became a polarizing symbol of the Trump administration's immigration policies, with supporters viewing it as a necessary measure and opponents describing conditions as vile and unsanitary. The Department of Homeland Security has disputed the claims of mistreatment while complying with the closure order.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant network outage, with many reporting their devices were limited to "SOS mode" for several hours. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service and stated that its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage, tracked by DownDetector, peaked with nearly 23,000 complaints from coast to coast. This incident marks another major service disruption for the carrier, following a similar large-scale outage that occurred in October 2024, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communication networks.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article explores the largely unregulated for-profit "body broker" industry in the United States, where companies acquire donated corpses, dismember them, and sell the parts for medical research. The piece highlights cases where families, believing they were making an altruistic donation, discovered their loved ones' remains were treated disrespectfully and grotesquely. Unlike in many other countries, loose US laws allow for charging "reasonable" processing fees, which has enabled a lucrative and sometimes exploitative global trade.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data from England indicates a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and attendance throughout the rest of the year. According to the figures, over half of the pupils who were partially absent during the first week in September 2024 later became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school. In contrast, only 14% of students with full attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize getting children in class from the start of the new term to combat ongoing attendance issues that have remained elevated since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about any such deployment and argued that President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The governor's comments escalate the conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement. A White House spokesperson dismissed the governor's concerns, criticizing the city's crime rate and calling his statements a deflection.</p>

This unique standing allows Prabowo to champion a model of "constructive pragmatism" that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation in an international system often paralyzed by competing national interests.

Del Toro emphasized his desire to create a physically real world for the film, favoring practical sets over CGI to enhance actor performances.

However, councillors rejected the plan, arguing that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character. The clock, a local landmark, recently underwent a £55,000 restoration funded by the council, and many local residents and business owners support keeping the chimes active 24 hours a day.</p>

However, modern forensic analysis of exhumed remains and crime scene evidence revealed inconsistencies with Pusser's account, including a likely self-inflicted gunshot wound and evidence that the scene was staged. The district attorney stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough evidence for a murder indictment.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck a gathering of senior Houthi officials, having received intelligence just hours before. Rahawi, who held the post since 2024, was considered more of a figurehead than a key military decision-maker within the movement, which has been launching attacks against Israel in solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United's Narrow Win Over Burnley Highlights Persistent Goalkeeping Issues</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley with a stoppage-time penalty, the performance underscored pressing concerns about the team's goalkeeping. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the team is in a moment where any shot near their box feels like a potential goal, a vulnerability exacerbated by recent errors from keepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. Bayindir's mistake against Burnley allowed the equalizing goal, continuing a pattern of costly blunders. The article suggests these ongoing issues make a rumored transfer for Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens more likely before the deadline closes.</p>

          <p>Lee Roy Jordan, a formidable linebacker and a key member of the Dallas Cowboys' famed "Doomsday" defense, has passed away at 84. Jordan was a five-time Pro Bowler who helped lead the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl victory in 1971.

          <h2>Appeals Court Rules Most of Trump's 'Reciprocal Tariffs' Are Illegal</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has dealt a significant blow to President Trump's trade agenda, ruling that his sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most countries are illegal. The court found that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the levies, stating that the power to impose such taxes rests exclusively with Congress. The ruling affects tariffs as high as 50% on goods from countries like India and Brazil, as well as previous levies on China, Canada, and Mexico. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed under a different law, remain unaffected by the decision.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Guidance on Safe and Healthy Screen Time for Children at Different Ages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides expert consensus on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that guidelines should align with developmental stages. For the youngest children, a "screen-free until age three" approach is recommended to allow for crucial exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and the importance of parental supervision and interaction. Experts stress that excessive screen time can displace vital activities like social interaction and motor skill development, potentially leading to poorer language skills, but also acknowledge the role of digital media in modern social life.</p>

          <h2>Investor Rebecca Patterson Warns of Economic Risks if Trump Politicizes the Federal Reserve</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Donald Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could jeopardize the central bank's independence and lead to negative long-term economic consequences. Patterson, a former Bridgewater strategist, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, potentially leading to weaker stock market performance, higher inflation, and a depreciated currency. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she cautions that sustained inflation would eventually harm consumption and earnings. She suggests such a move would ultimately weaken the dollar and boost gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded the performance of Jack Grealish, who provided two assists in the team's 3-2 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Since joining on loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been in excellent form, becoming the first Everton player to assist two or more goals in consecutive Premier League games. Moyes described Grealish as a "maverick" who is "even better than I thought," suggesting the player is thriving with more consistent game time and a need to prove himself. Grealish's resurgence at Everton comes after he was left out of the latest England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health. In an op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy's longstanding anti-vaccine stance and advocacy for conspiracy theories, which he argues are being implemented as dangerous policy. The senator pointed to the recent firing of the CDC director and subsequent resignations as evidence of Kennedy's war on science. Sanders warned that these actions are dismantling the nation's public health infrastructure and could lead to the resurgence of diseases that were previously eradicated by safe and effective vaccines.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with eliminating over 500 jobs at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The announcement from acting CEO Kari Lake came just one day after a federal judge blocked her from firing VOA's director, Michael Abramowitz, and ordered her to comply with previous rulings to restore the news outlet's operations. The administration stated the job cuts are being done at the president's direction to reduce federal bureaucracy. Critics and employee groups have called the move an illegal attack on a federally funded news organization designed to provide objective news globally.</p>
