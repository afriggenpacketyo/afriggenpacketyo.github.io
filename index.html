        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite previous challenges, the onshore wind energy industry is experiencing a resurgence through "repowering," upgrading or replacing aging turbines. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from this trend, reporting revenue increases in 2024. The repowering process allows for increased electricity output and longer lifecycles, presenting economic benefits for operators. While the Trump administration has taken measures to bolster coal mining, the repowering of wind farms is creating new business opportunities and supporting advanced manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>Recent pauses in data center projects by major tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon do not indicate a bust, but rather a strategic reallocation of resources. The AI data center market remains strong, with Amazon and Nvidia reaffirming continued high demand. Factors such as new AI technologies, the Stargate initiative, and tariff concerns are influencing companies to reassess their spending strategies. Experts believe this pause is temporary, driven by a reshuffling of priorities in an environment where power, fiber, water, and land are scarce.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted an extensive air campaign, Operation Rough Rider, against Houthi militia targets in Yemen, striking over 800 locations in the past six weeks.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed cuts to scientific research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are causing concern among scientists, potentially leading to a "brain drain" as they seek opportunities abroad. The cuts have already impacted research funding and job security, prompting many scientists to consider leaving the U.S. Other countries, including China, are actively recruiting scientific talent, potentially benefiting from the U.S.'s loss of momentum in medical research.</p>

          <p>The U.S. birth rate remains historically low, prompting discussion about the underlying causes and potential solutions. Declining teenage pregnancy rates, shifting societal values, and economic concerns are contributing factors. While some propose financial incentives to encourage childbirth, others suggest addressing the challenges of childcare and economic stability. Immigration and technological advancements are also seen as potential factors influencing population change.</p>
