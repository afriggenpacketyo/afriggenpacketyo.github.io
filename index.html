          <p>U.S. airline Breeze Airways, founded by JetBlue's David Neeleman, will launch its first international routes early next year, connecting several U.S. cities with popular vacation spots like Cancun and Montego Bay. This expansion marks a significant milestone for the airline, which has focused on underserved domestic routes since its 2021 debut. The carrier has now received the necessary FAA certification to operate internationally, a first for a new U.S. passenger airline since Virgin America. The new routes are intended to attract sun-seeking travelers with competitive introductory fares.</p>

          <p>Career federal prosecutors in Virginia concluded there was not enough evidence to criminally charge former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress, according to sources. Despite this finding, the newly appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury. This move follows President Trump's public calls to prosecute political adversaries and comes just before the statute of limitations expires. The situation has created significant tension within the Department of Justice over adherence to standard prosecutorial guidelines.</p>

          <p>With a potential federal government shutdown just days away, Congressional Democrats are insisting that any short-term funding bill must include an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. Republicans are pushing for a "clean" stopgap bill without policy additions, calling the Democratic demands unreasonable. The dispute centers on enhanced subsidies that lower health insurance costs for millions of Americans, which are set to expire soon. The political standoff has escalated, with both sides betting the other will be blamed by voters if the government shuts down and healthcare premiums rise.</p>

As part of the settlement, Amazon, which admitted no wrongdoing, must make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent. This marks one of the largest penalties ever imposed by the FTC, signaling a major win for the regulatory agency.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming North American stores and laying off 900 corporate employees. CEO Brian Niccol stated the move is a necessary part of his "Back to Starbucks" turnaround strategy, which aims to improve profitability and customer service by reallocating resources. The company has faced six consecutive quarters of declining same-store sales, and this plan is intended to manage expenses and restore operating margins. The changes have drawn criticism from the workers' union, which cited a lack of barista input in major decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan could be highly influential in resolving the war in Ukraine, particularly if he were to stop purchasing Russian oil. Speaking alongside Erdoğan at the White House, Trump urged the Turkish leader to leverage his position to pressure Moscow, noting that cutting off oil revenue is critical. The discussion also touched upon Turkey's desire to purchase U.S. F-35 fighter jets, a deal previously blocked due to Turkey's acquisition of a Russian air defense system.

          <p>The escalating cost of senior care, with nursing homes now averaging over $120,000 annually, is making long-term care insurance an increasingly relevant consideration for retirement planning. Many Americans mistakenly believe Medicare covers these expenses, but it only provides limited, short-term skilled nursing care, not the custodial care most seniors need. With about 70% of seniors expected to require long-term care, insurance can protect retirement savings from being depleted. Securing a policy is easier and cheaper when applicants are younger and in good health, making proactive planning essential.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially objected to a United Nations political declaration aimed at preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases and promoting mental health. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the decision at the U.N. General Assembly, stating the declaration ignores more pressing health issues and oversteps the U.N.'s proper role. While he did not specify which issues were being ignored, he affirmed that the U.S. would continue its commitment to ending chronic diseases globally. The move signals a significant divergence between the U.S. and the international body on public health strategy.</p>

          <p>Ken Griffin, the billionaire CEO of Citadel, has strongly criticized the Trump administration for engaging in "crony capitalism" by making special deals with large corporations to exempt them from tariffs. In an interview, Griffin argued that such practices are anti-American and create a system where the "big and the connected" are favored over others. He warned that when the government begins picking winners and losers, it undermines fair competition and ultimately harms the entire economy. Griffin believes this approach shifts corporate focus from innovation to securing political favors from Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) will stop issuing paper checks to its nearly 70 million beneficiaries starting September 30, completing a transition to fully electronic payments. Recipients will now receive their benefits via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card. The SSA states this move will improve efficiency, enhance security, and reduce costs, noting that paper checks are significantly more likely to be lost or stolen. While the transition was mandated by a 2025 executive order, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means of receiving payments.</p>

          <p>New CDC data reveals a concerning trend: while rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis among U.S. adults fell in 2024, cases of congenital syphilis surged for the 12th consecutive year. Congenital syphilis, which occurs when a mother passes the infection to her baby during pregnancy, can lead to miscarriage, infant death, and severe lifelong health problems. The report showed nearly 4,000 newborn cases in 2024, a nearly 700% increase over the past decade. Health officials suggest that a lack of adequate prenatal screening is a significant factor contributing to this preventable public health crisis.</p>

          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has ruled that the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set breached the corporation's guidelines on harm and offence. The ruling cited the band's on-stage chant of "death, death to the IDF" and other derogatory comments, which the unit determined could be characterized as antisemitic. However, the unit cleared the performance of breaching rules on impartiality and incitement to crime, arguing the chants were directed at an institution. The incident had previously drawn an apology from the BBC's director general and led to changes in streaming live events.</p>

          <p>HSBC, in collaboration with IBM, has successfully used quantum computing to enhance its algorithmic bond trading, a development the bank calls a "ground-breaking world-first." In a trial, the combination of classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor resulted in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of bond price predictions. This advancement allows for a better estimation of the likelihood that a trade will be filled at a quoted price, potentially increasing margins and market liquidity. The trial provides some of the first empirical evidence of quantum computing's practical application in finance.</p>

          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected lift as consumers rush to buy cars before potential price hikes from tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits. Cox Automotive has raised its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units due to this stronger-than-expected demand. However, analysts warn this is likely a temporary "pull-ahead" effect, with sales expected to slow in the fourth quarter and into the next year. The trend has disproportionately benefited larger automakers like General Motors and Toyota, while smaller brands have seen their market share decline. (not investment advice)</p>
