          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has prompted mandatory evacuations for thousands of residents in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township. The fire, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has consumed over 8,500 acres and is only 10% contained, threatening approximately 1,320 structures. The blaze has led to numerous road closures, including portions of the Garden State Parkway and Route 9, and caused power outages affecting over 25,000 customers as officials work to protect crews and the public. Shelters have been opened by the Red Cross to assist those displaced by the ongoing emergency.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. automotive industry groups, representing automakers, suppliers, and dealers, have joined forces to lobby the Trump administration against imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts. In a letter to key administration officials, the groups warn that these tariffs could severely disrupt U.S. automotive production and cause significant financial distress to suppliers, potentially leading to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies. The rare unified message underscores the industry's concern over the potential economic fallout, including reduced vehicle sales and increased costs exceeding $100 billion.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists suggest that President Trump's recent statements indicating a softening stance on tariffs against China may not signal progress in trade negotiations but rather reveal U.S. anxiety and offer Beijing an advantage. Trump's remarks about lowering tariffs, while not eliminating them entirely, are perceived as a tactic to signal to China, but analysts argue this display of eagerness could allow China to secure a more favorable deal. Experts believe China is not showing similar signs of impatience in the trade discussions.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has unveiled a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six other dyes commonly found in cereals, ice cream, and snacks. This initiative follows concerns about potential health risks associated with these dyes, including links to hyperactivity and other conditions, with the administration seeking voluntary cooperation from food companies to transition to natural alternatives.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecasts for China, India, and Japan, citing ongoing trade tensions and high policy uncertainty. The IMF reduced China's projection to 4% and India's to 6.2%, while also cutting Japan's forecast to 0.6%. Globally, the IMF lowered its growth outlook to 2.8%, attributing the downturn to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners, which are seen as a significant negative shock to economic growth and stability.

          <p>President Trump has indicated that tariffs on goods from China will be reduced but not eliminated, following statements from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting a de-escalation in the trade war. Trump's initial imposition of high tariffs on China led to retaliatory measures and market volatility, but he now states he will be more conciliatory. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he will begin stepping back from his role at DOGE, the "department of government efficiency," after reporting a significant drop in profits amid criticism of his White House role.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing a challenging year due to the escalating U.S.-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. Exports to the U.S., the largest market, are likely to be affected by higher tariffs, potentially causing producers to cut capital expenditure. This situation could lead to a slowdown in the expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS) capacity. The sector is also grappling with overproduction, resulting in a price war and declining export prices.</p>

          <p>While China grapples with declining birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly its Chaoshan region, is bucking the trend due to cultural traditions that value larger families.

This contrasts with the national trend, where many young people are reluctant to have children.
