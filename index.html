          <p>The US government shutdown is poised to continue into the next week, as repeated Senate votes on funding legislation have failed to break the political deadlock. Lawmakers remain deeply divided over budget allocations, preventing the passage of critical spending bills and leading to a prolonged halt in non-essential federal operations. This ongoing impasse significantly impacts numerous government services, from national parks to federal agencies, and creates uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. The inability to reach a bipartisan agreement underscores persistent political challenges in Washington.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is deploying 300 National Guard members to Chicago, a move vehemently opposed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who dismisses it as a "manufactured performance" by the Trump administration. This federal intervention intensifies amidst ongoing confrontations between immigration authorities and protesters in the Chicago area. A recent incident saw federal agents shoot an "armed U.S. citizen" after their vehicles were allegedly rammed, further inflaming tensions. Local leaders criticize the deployment, viewing it as an escalation of aggression focused on political optics rather than genuine public safety concerns.</p>

This article details Peterson's account of Grande's perceived snobbery and her subsequent reaction to the apology, reigniting long-standing "diva" rumors surrounding the Grammy-winning artist.</p>

          <p>Vilnius Airport in Lithuania experienced a temporary closure of its airspace during the early hours of Sunday, reportedly due to the sighting of a series of hot air balloons heading towards the facility. This unexpected incident led to the redirection of several flights to alternative airports, including Riga and Kaunas, causing travel disruptions. The event is the latest in a series of European airport closures linked to unidentified aerial objects, highlighting growing concerns about airspace security and the challenges posed by such incursions.</p>

          <p>Freshers' flu, a common illness among new university students, is an assortment of respiratory viruses that spread rapidly in close-quarter environments. Immunologists explain that students' immune systems are often compromised by stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption during freshers' week. The article highlights how young people, exposed to new viral strains from diverse backgrounds, frequently experience symptoms that can linger, though it is rarely serious. Despite the illness, many students prioritize socialising, contributing to its widespread nature.</p>
