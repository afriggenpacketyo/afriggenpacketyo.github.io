        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following violent clashes between demonstrators and authorities over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, President Trump authorized the deployment of National Guard troops. The arrival of these troops comes after ICE conducted raids, leading to protests and arrests. Secretary of Defense Hegseth threatened to involve active duty Marines, while Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory. House Speaker Johnson supported Trump's decision, emphasizing the need for leadership and authority in addressing the situation. The protests stemmed from ICE operations in the fashion district and other areas, where agents detained individuals allegedly violating immigration laws, sparking community outrage and demands for their release. The LAPD stated that they responded swiftly given the conditions, but ICE officials claimed that local law enforcement was slow to respond. </p>

          <p>Costco has introduced a new frozen strawberry lemonade drink at its food courts, priced at $2.99 with 250 calories, made with real fruit and no artificial flavors or colors. Member reviews are varied, with some finding it refreshing and others considering it too tart or sweet, some even preferring the previous strawberry banana smoothie. One customer recounted a frustrating experience with the drink's fruit chunks clogging the straw, ultimately resorting to blending it at home. The frozen strawberry lemonade has replaced the strawberry banana smoothie, and Costco has made headlines recently for food court changes, including the return of the combo pizza as a calzone. </p>

          <p>Enrique Anaya, a constitutional lawyer and vocal critic of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, was arrested on charges of money laundering. Anaya, who has previously labeled Bukele a dictator, was detained at his home in Santa Tecla. Human rights organizations have condemned the arrest, suggesting it aims to silence dissent against the government. Bukele's administration has faced criticism for its hardline approach to gangs, leading to concerns about civil liberties.

          <p>President Trump's swift response to immigration protests in Los Angeles involved federalizing the California National Guard over Governor Newsom's objections. Trump administration officials claimed that immigration agents were being targeted and injured, and local law enforcement was too slow to respond. The LAPD stated that they acted swiftly given the conditions, but Homeland Security Secretary Noem stated that LAPD waited hours to respond. The President declared victory after deploying the National Guard, though they had not yet fully assembled. This action follows Trump's campaign promise to address left-wing lawlessness, raising concerns about states' rights and proportionality. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most frequent sources of conflict in relationships, based on research and a YouGov poll. These include tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, a predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor, including the unacknowledged "invisible load," can cause conflict, and ineffective communication styles can derail conversations. The article suggests strategies for resolving these conflicts, such as naming the effect of condescension, reassuring one another, redistributing tasks, and using a designated word to signal a time-out. </p>

Vice President Vance defended the move, framing the protesters as "insurrectionists."

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles is viewed by some as an attempt to redirect dissent from policy failures to an "enemy within." Critics see the move as an authoritarian flex, using protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a focal point for anger and fear. The protests allow Trump to divert attention from policy failures and his feud with Elon Musk. Some compare the situation to 2020 when Trump used national guard troops to quell Black Lives Matter protests, while others highlight his failure to act during the January 6 Capitol attack. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as a spectacle, while Defense Secretary Hegseth threatened to involve regular military forces. </p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were forced to take a bus after their plane was diverted to Rome due to its size.

Passengers were then transported by bus from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours. American Airlines apologized for the disruption, citing "operational limitations." The airline typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route. </p>

          <p>Richard Tice, Reform UK's deputy leader, denied claims of chaos within the party after Chairman Zia Yusuf resigned and then returned in a different role. Tice explained that Yusuf had been "exhausted" from the demanding job of chairing the rapidly growing party. Yusuf will now lead the party's unit focused on identifying spending cuts at councils. The situation arose after Yusuf criticized Sarah Pochin, Reform's newest MP, for questioning the government about banning the burka. The party expects to appoint a new chairman and deputy chairman next week. </p>
