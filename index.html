        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly stated his intention to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she does not resign from her position. Speaking to reporters, Trump characterized her performance as "bad," intensifying his long-standing pressure on the central bank. This threat follows earlier demands for Cook's resignation, which she has dismissed as an attempt to bully her out of her position based on unsubstantiated allegations of mortgage fraud. The situation further highlights the ongoing political clash over the Federal Reserve's autonomy and the independence of its leadership from presidential influence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office is seeking to appeal a High Court ruling that blocks asylum seekers from being housed in the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. This legal challenge follows a temporary injunction granted to the Epping Forest District Council, which cited escalating community tensions after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault. The government argues for a "properly managed way" to close all asylum hotels across the country, rather than through piecemeal court decisions that could create chaos elsewhere. However, the ruling has prompted more than half a dozen other councils to consider similar legal action, highlighting the broader national challenge of accommodating a record number of asylum applicants.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez is scheduled for a parole board hearing in California, a day after his brother Erik was denied release. The brothers were convicted in 1995 for the 1989 murders of their parents, receiving life sentences later reduced to 50 years to life, making them parole eligible. They maintain they acted in self-defense due to alleged physical, sexual, and emotional abuse from their parents. Prosecutors oppose their release, arguing they haven't taken full responsibility, while the parole board cited Erik's prison behavior as a key factor in his denial.</p>

          <p>Federal agents from the FBI were observed searching the Maryland residence of John Bolton, former National Security Adviser to President Trump. The operation involved approximately six FBI vehicles and lasted over an hour on Friday morning, with local police temporarily blocking access to Bolton's street. While agents were seen entering and exiting the house, it remains unclear whether any items were seized from the property. This developing story suggests an active federal investigation concerning a prominent figure from the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized nearly 2,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen to carry service-issued weapons in Washington D.C., should their mission require it. This directive, confirmed by a U.S. official, is aimed at supporting efforts to lower the crime rate in the nation's capital. The troops are expected to begin operating with their weapons in the coming days, aligning with the Trump administration's broader initiative to crack down on crime. This move represents a notable escalation in the use of armed military personnel for domestic law enforcement purposes within the city.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the historical use of starvation as a weapon of war, highlighting how Israel's actions in Gaza present a distinct case. It details the deliberate blocking of humanitarian aid by Israel since October 2023, which has led to widespread malnutrition and an official famine declaration in Gaza City. Unlike many past famines often linked to market failures or climate events, the current crisis is described as "entirely human-made," with Israel maintaining full control over aid access.

          <p>The presence of U.S. warships near Venezuela highlights the country's complex role in the international oil trade. Venezuela possesses the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at 303 billion barrels, but its production remains significantly hampered by U.S. sanctions imposed since 2019 on state-owned PDVSA. Despite these sanctions, PDVSA reportedly increased its crude oil and fuel exports by 15% year-on-year in 2024. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and military presence raise questions about the future stability of oil supply from the region.</p>

          <p>Former rangers and residents protested at Glacier National Park against significant staff and funding cuts by the Trump administration. Critics argue these reductions have left national parks, including Glacier, with inadequate infrastructure and insufficient staff to manage facilities or respond to emergencies. Despite congressional funding acts, the administration's hiring freezes and budget rescissions have led to a nearly quarter loss of permanent staff and severe operational strain. Concerns are growing about visitor and staff safety, with some experts fearing these cuts are a deliberate attempt to sabotage the park system for future privatization.</p>
