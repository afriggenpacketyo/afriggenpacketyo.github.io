          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has requested Secretary of State Marco Rubio to provide information on contingency plans in case Elon Musk breaches contracts with the U.S. government amidst a public fallout with President Trump. Warren expressed concerns that the online spat between Trump and Musk could have serious implications for national security, especially regarding SpaceX and Starlink. She also requested analysis on the Trump administration's options under the Defense Production Act to address vendor lock-in and contractor refusal to meet national security needs. Warren has been a vocal critic of Musk and his involvement in the Trump administration, previously releasing a report outlining instances of Musk benefiting from it.</p>

          <p>Jamie Borthwick, known for his role as Jay Brown on EastEnders, has been suspended by the BBC after using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of Strictly Come Dancing. The incident occurred during filming for the Blackpool week episode of the BBC dance show last November. Borthwick issued an apology, stating that he did not fully understand the derogatory term and its meaning, and disability charity Scope has urged him to educate himself on the reality of disabled people's lives. The BBC has condemned Borthwick's language as entirely unacceptable and not reflective of the values or standards they uphold.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security stated that those arrested had final orders of removal and had not complied with that order, and that ICE will continue to enforce the nation's immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes have resulted in the deaths of dozens of people in Gaza during the Eid al-Adha holiday, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. Humanitarian groups, including UNICEF, have reported a sharp increase in acute malnutrition among young children in Gaza, nearly tripling since the ceasefire period earlier this year. James Elder of UNICEF described a "man-made nutritional crisis," with a lack of basic medical supplies and aid being used as "bait" at distribution points run by military contractors, leading to civilian casualties. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US and Israel-backed aid network, has halted operations following deadly incidents and accusations of endangering civilians.</p>

Trump told NBC News that he has no intention of mending ties with Musk, citing Musk's disrespect towards the office of the president. The fallout began after Musk criticized the "Big Beautiful Bill," claiming it would undermine his efforts to cut government spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has since deleted a post accusing Trump of being implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein files, and Trump has threatened to cut Musk's federal government contracts.</p>

          <p>The arrest of David Huerta, president of SEIU-USWW and SEIU California, by ICE has sparked outrage among unions and political leaders in California. Huerta was arrested for allegedly obstructing federal agents executing a warrant at a worksite, with some reports indicating he was pepper-sprayed and injured. Union leaders like Tia Orr have stated that the arrest has galvanized the labor movement and immigrant communities, leading to plans for action. The arrest comes amid increased ICE raids, prompting concerns about the treatment of immigrant workers and the targeting of union organizers.</p>

          <p>The public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk is causing concern among some Republicans, who worry it could stoke divisions within the party ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his suggestion of forming a new political party have created uncertainty. Some Republicans fear that Musk's influence and financial support, which were significant in the last election, may now be directed elsewhere. While some downplay the impact of the feud, others acknowledge that it could complicate efforts to pass key legislation and undermine Trump's agenda.</p>

Abrego Garcia's attorney claims that his client is not going to be convicted of these crimes, and has criticized the government's handling of the case.

          <p>Sir David Attenborough has described the damage to the world's oceans as "unspeakably awful" in an interview with Prince William, ahead of the UN Oceans Conference. Attenborough expressed particular concern about the destructive impact of certain fishing methods, like bottom trawling, on marine life and the ocean's ability to store carbon. The UN aims to secure ratification of the High Seas Treaty, which seeks to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030, but scientists and NGOs worry that current practices, such as bottom trawling, could undermine the effectiveness of these protected areas. The conference will address issues such as plastic pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation of the oceans.</p>
