          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station, beginning their 17.5-hour journey back to Earth. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, named Endurance, is scheduled for a historic splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, a new landing location for NASA-sponsored flights. In a departure ceremony, the crew highlighted the importance of international cooperation in space, especially during tumultuous times on Earth. The mission, lasting 148 days, marks a significant milestone as their replacements from Crew-11 have already arrived and begun their tenure aboard the station.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its dispute with Harvard University, threatening to take control of patents developed through federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick initiated a review, alleging the university has not complied with the Bayh-Dole Act, which requires such inventions to benefit the American public. The administration is demanding a list of all relevant patents and details on their application and licensing to ensure substantial U.S. manufacturing. This move could impact patents worth hundreds of millions and represents a significant challenge to the university's handling of its intellectual property.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump suggested a deal could involve territorial swaps, a condition Ukraine has historically rejected since the 2022 invasion. The announcement follows a visit to Moscow by a U.S. special envoy and reports that Putin might agree to a ceasefire if Russia retains control of occupied territories. European officials and analysts express skepticism, viewing the summit as a diplomatic victory for Moscow regardless of the outcome for Ukraine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has reportedly directed the U.S. military to develop plans for targeting drug cartels in Latin America, framing the issue as a matter of national security rather than just law enforcement. This directive follows earlier actions by his administration, including designating several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations to grant more legal authority for action. The move aims to combat the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into the United States. While it is unclear when or if military action will occur, the policy signals a significant escalation in the U.S. approach to transnational criminal organizations.</p>

The two, who come from different sides of the political spectrum, have bonded over shared experiences of challenging childhoods and their Christian faith. This relationship is seen as potentially beneficial for U.S.-UK relations, particularly given the personalized nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy. While on holiday in the UK, Vance is staying with Lammy, highlighting a diplomatic bridge-building effort that extends beyond traditional party lines.</p>

This event is part of a series of demonstrations following the release of footage showing dozens of men being held in bare rooms with minimal provisions, which authorities maintain is only a processing center.</p>

          <p>British authorities arrested 280 individuals during a week-long operation targeting migrants working illegally as food delivery riders. The crackdown, which involved checking nearly 1,800 people, is part of a broader government initiative to tackle illegal migration and enforce labor laws. The operation also resulted in civil penalties for 51 businesses, including restaurants and car washes, for employing workers without legal status. This enforcement action comes as the government strikes new data-sharing deals with major food delivery companies like Deliveroo and Uber Eats to prevent illegal employment in the gig economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A wave of protests is occurring across the UK against the government's use of over 200 hotels to house asylum seekers, fueled by local safety concerns and promoted by activist groups. One such protest in Epping, Essex, was sparked by the arrest of an asylum seeker on sexual assault charges, galvanizing local residents who feel the presence of all-male migrant populations creates an imbalance. While some far-right activists are involved, many protesters are ordinary citizens, indicating a broader shift in public mood. The situation is complicated by a lack of official data on hotel occupants, creating an information vacuum that fuels local anxieties.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," by Andrew Lownie, presents a deeply unflattering portrait of Prince Andrew, likely cementing his permanent removal from public royal life. The book meticulously details his arrogance, poor judgment, and extensive connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, based on hundreds of interviews. It portrays a life filled with scandals involving sex and money, from associations with dictators' relatives to a lack of self-awareness that alienated diplomats. The biography suggests that any potential return to royal duties for the prince is now virtually impossible.</p>

          <p>To streamline the security process for travelers with young children, Orlando International Airport (MCO) has launched dedicated TSA family lanes at all its checkpoints. The new lanes are designed for adults traveling with children aged 12 and under, aiming to reduce stress for families and decongest other security lines by isolating bulky items like strollers and car seats. Airport officials believe MCO processes more child-related travel gear than any other airport, making it a logical choice for the initiative.

The initiative has been unexpectedly popular, attracting 20,000 visitors since March, far exceeding projections.

This plan is opposed by a majority of the Israeli public and the nation's security establishment, who view a prolonged occupation as a strategic trap. Despite international pressure and domestic opposition, Netanyahu's actions are heavily influenced by his need to maintain his coalition and his political relationship with U.S. President Trump, creating a significant gap between national interest and government policy.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chain Wendy's has reduced its full-year sales forecast, citing increased competition and economic uncertainty that is particularly affecting its lower-income customer base. Executives noted that consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending, with breakfast being one of the first meals they choose to eat at home to save money. This trend contrasts with competitor McDonald's, which has successfully attracted value-conscious customers with its expanded value menu. Wendy's acknowledged the need to improve its value marketing to better compete for the attention of inflation-weary diners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has issued an apology and a £1,000 charity donation after mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe had posted on social media about a "dinghy" arriving near Great Yarmouth, alerting authorities and calling for mass deportations. It was later revealed the boat contained a crew, including a former Royal Marine, rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. The crew found the incident humorous, while Lowe defended his vigilance as a response to constituent concerns about a "national crisis."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, vacating a lower court's criminal contempt order against officials for deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in defiance of a judge's directive. The case stems from the use of the Alien Enemies Act to expel alleged gang members, which a district judge had temporarily blocked. The appeals court ruled 2-1 that the lower court overstepped its authority, with the majority opinion noting the planes were already outside U.S. airspace when the order was issued. The decision marks a significant victory for the administration in an ongoing power struggle with the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military intervention in Mexico, stating "there will be no invasion" in response to reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security, it will never accept the presence of foreign troops on its soil. The statements aim to quell nationalist fears in Mexico, which have grown since the U.S. designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move many see as a potential prelude to unilateral military action.</p>

The summit is seen as a critical, long-awaited step after Trump's envoy met with Putin in Moscow to lay the groundwork for direct talks.</p>

The incidents, which have paused several games, are being investigated by the league, which has promised to ban and prosecute any fan caught participating. While a meme-coin group has claimed responsibility for some of the disruptions as a viral marketing stunt, the variety of items thrown suggests not all incidents are linked. Players have expressed frustration that the stunts detract from the seriousness of the sport and pose a safety risk.</p>

In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices due to fewer new homes being built.
