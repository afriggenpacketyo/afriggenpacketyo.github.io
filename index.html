          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 06:12:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the United States potentially reducing its military aid to Ukraine, European leaders are increasingly worried about their ability to supply Ukraine with necessary weapons, particularly as aid approved under the Biden administration is set to expire this summer. While European nations have collectively provided about half of the $130 billion in military support to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, they face challenges in rapidly increasing weapons production due to limited industrial capacity. This situation forces European countries to balance rearming themselves with supporting Ukraine, creating a dual problem that strains their resources and leaves Ukraine potentially vulnerable in the short term, possibly leading to territorial losses if American weapons are not available.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 06:11:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, particularly in cases involving undocumented migrants. Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, argued that the Constitution allows for such suspensions during times of rebellion or invasion and claimed Congress has already limited judicial jurisdiction over immigration cases. Legal experts and critics have questioned this interpretation, asserting that the power to suspend habeas corpus lies with Congress, not the President. This consideration arises amidst ongoing civil cases challenging the administration's deportation policies and detentions of foreign students critical of certain policies.</p>

          <p>Allegations have emerged that Rinaldo Nazzaro, the leader of the neo-Nazi group The Base, may be a Russian spy, raising concerns about Russia's co-opting of far-right groups to undermine Western democracies. Nazzaro, a former Pentagon contractor, allegedly has ties to the FSB, one of Russia's main intelligence services. Experts suggest that the Kremlin uses far-right groups to sow discord and carry out attacks, particularly since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin may be cultivating relationships with these groups as a form of strategic depth, potentially using them for future operations against the West.</p>

          <p>A McDonald's secret menu item called the "Cotton Candy Sprite" has gained popularity on social media, involving ordering a medium Sprite with three pumps of French vanilla syrup. The drink, only available for in-person orders, has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising its flavor and others expressing skepticism or disappointment. This isn't the first time a McDonald's secret menu hack has gone viral, as the "Land, Air & Sea" sandwich previously gained traction. While McDonald's has not officially embraced the Cotton Candy Sprite, its viral status indicates the power of social media in influencing consumer trends and creating buzz around fast-food offerings.</p>

He points to the success of pitchers like Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine, who focused on movement and control rather than maximum effort.</p>

The expansion targets areas with high population growth, both inland in California and out-of-state.

          <p>Democratic U.S. representatives for California visited the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to voice concerns about the slowdown in activity due to President Trump's tariffs. The tariffs, intended to boost U.S. manufacturing, have resulted in fewer cargo containers moving through the ports, impacting jobs for longshoremen and truckers and potentially raising consumer prices. The representatives criticized Trump's view that the slowdown was a "good thing," emphasizing the negative effects on port workers and American families. Port officials predict a significant drop in activity, with numerous ships canceling planned trips.</p>

          <p>In California's "salad bowl," some farmers are investing in housing for H-2A guest workers due to labor shortages and increased immigration enforcement. These modern housing complexes aim to address the affordable housing crisis exacerbated by growers buying up local homes and motels. While some community members are skeptical, citing the needs of domestic farmworkers, county leaders see it as a win-win. With the Trump administration's focus on deportations, growers are seeking legal avenues to stabilize their labor supply, but concerns remain about potential exploitation within the H-2A program.</p>

          <p>The conflict between India and Pakistan has escalated, with both sides targeting air bases and accusing each other of initiating strikes. Pakistan claims India targeted its air bases with missiles, while India states it retaliated against Pakistani military targets after a wave of attacks. International concern is growing, with the U.S. urging de-escalation and offering assistance. Both countries maintain they seek de-escalation, but the confrontation has intensified since India's initial airstrikes in Pakistan, prompted by accusations of Pakistani support for terrorist groups.</p>

          <p>A former top European Union official has urged the bloc to manage its competition with China responsibly, emphasizing that their relationship should not be influenced by other world powers. Charles Michel, former president of the European Council, stated that stability and predictability are in everyone's interests despite potential tensions arising from different traditions and political systems. His comments come amid easing strains between Europe and China, with both lifting restrictions on reciprocal exchanges and marking 50 years of diplomatic relations, with Chinese President Xi Jinping calling for a “sound and stable” relationship.</p>

Trump's own super PAC, MAGA Inc., has amassed significant funds, potentially overshadowing the congressional super PACs.
