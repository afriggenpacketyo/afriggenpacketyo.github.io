          <h2>Spotify Stock Declines Amid Revenue Miss and Weak Guidance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 09:40:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spotify's shares fell over 8% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street's revenue expectations and provided a lackluster outlook for the current quarter. The music streaming service posted a net loss of 86 million euros, despite a 10% increase in revenue year-over-year. Higher personnel, marketing, and professional services costs, along with social charges, contributed to the financial performance. The company's forecast for the third quarter also fell short, indicating continued challenges despite growth in monthly active users and premium subscribers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PayPal's stock declined over 8% despite reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results, as concerns mounted over slowing growth in transaction margin dollars, a key profitability metric. While total payment volume exceeded estimates and active accounts increased, the growth rate for transaction margin dollars decelerated sequentially. CEO Alex Chriss is focusing on monetizing acquisitions like Venmo, which saw significant revenue growth. The company updated its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast upward, signaling a stronger fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Midtown Manhattan office building shooting, Shane Tamura, who killed four people before dying by suicide, left a note claiming he suffered from CTE and blaming the NFL. Police sources indicated one page of the note accused the NFL of concealing dangers to players' brains for profit, while another requested his brain be studied. Although Tamura played high school football, investigators have found no evidence of a traumatic brain injury or CTE. The incident tragically highlights ongoing discussions about brain injuries in contact sports and gun violence. This article provides critical context regarding the shooter's alleged motive.</p>

His recent analysis showing a 27% drop in overdose deaths from 2023 rates brought immense relief, attributed to a less deadly drug supply, improved treatment access, and increased naloxone distribution. Dasgupta's lab focuses on analyzing drug samples to inform individuals who use drugs about the unpredictable supply.

          <p>The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) announced a new delay in the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris from the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, pushing the start to 2037 or later. This latest setback means TEPCO will need 12 to 15 years for preparation, including radiation reduction and facility construction, at the No. 3 reactor. Despite the delay, TEPCO maintains its overall decommissioning target of 2051, though some experts believe the work could take over a century. The challenge highlights the immense complexity and long-term nature of nuclear disaster recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit in goods sharply contracted by 10.8% to $86.0 billion in June, exceeding economists' expectations. This narrowing deficit, driven by a decline in imports, is expected to contribute significantly to a rebound in economic growth for the second quarter. The Commerce Department's Census Bureau reported that goods imports decreased by $11.5 billion, while exports slipped slightly. This reversal from the previous quarter, where the trade deficit negatively impacted GDP, suggests a more favorable trade balance for the economy.

          <p>Despite months of warnings from manufacturers and retailers, the full impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices has yet to materialize, largely due to delays and companies absorbing costs. Major tariffs have been repeatedly pushed back, allowing businesses to stockpile goods at lower rates, particularly for the holiday season. However, importers are now holding back shipments due to uncertainty, and rising warehouse storage costs are adding pressure. While overall inflation has been limited so far, experts warn that steeper tariffs, if implemented, will eventually lead to higher prices for heavily imported products as companies can no longer fully absorb the additional expenses.
