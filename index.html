        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to the Trump administration's request for an accelerated review of lower court rulings that deemed many of the president's global tariffs illegal. The case, which will be heard in November, centers on whether the president overstepped congressional authority by using emergency economic powers to impose widespread duties on imports. The administration has warned that a delayed, unfavorable ruling could force the U.S. Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion in collected tariffs, highlighting the significant economic stakes of the decision.</p>

          <p>A district court judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans accused of acting as false electors for Donald Trump after the 2020 election. The group faced felony forgery charges for signing a document claiming they were the state's legitimate electors, despite Joe Biden's victory. This ruling represents a significant setback for prosecutors in Michigan and adds to the legal challenges facing similar cases in other states like Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to hold talks with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in London, where he plans to address the "intolerable situation in Gaza." The meeting occurs as Israel expands its military operations and faces international scrutiny, with some UK politicians calling for Herzog to be denied entry over allegations of war crimes. Downing Street has stated Starmer will emphasize the need for Israel to act to end the suffering, while navigating the UK's official position that it has not concluded Israel is committing genocide.</p>

          <p>Key inflation reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are anticipated to reveal a rise in prices for August, potentially pushing the annual inflation rate to 2.9%. Economists suggest this increase is largely driven by tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader service sector inflation, which is a key area of focus for the Federal Reserve. Despite the expected uptick in headline inflation, analysts believe the underlying trends will not deter the Fed from implementing an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting.

Residents of high-income states like Wyoming are projected to see the largest average cuts, while those in lower-income states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest. The law's structure, which includes a higher cap on state and local tax deductions and larger cuts for high earners, is the primary reason for this geographic disparity. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement, backed by Egypt, comes at a critical time as European powers are moving to reimpose sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>A sports analysis suggests that Manchester City striker Erling Haaland's phenomenal goalscoring record is due more to his exceptional ability to create high-quality chances than to his finishing skills alone. While his finishing is above average, data shows that his physical attributes—strength, speed, and height—combined with his intelligent movement and anticipation allow him to get into scoring positions far more effectively than other elite strikers. This ability to consistently generate superior opportunities is identified as the primary driver of his record-breaking goal tallies.</p>
