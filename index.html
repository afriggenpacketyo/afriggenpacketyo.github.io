          <p>The U.S. State Department's annual human rights review has raised significant concerns about the situation in South Africa, citing a "significantly worsened" environment. The report, submitted to Congress, highlights credible accounts of "extrajudicial killings" by government agents and repressive actions against Afrikaner minorities. It specifically points to the "Kill the Boer" song used at rallies and land expropriation policies as fueling violence and undermining equal opportunity. The South African government has consistently denied these allegations of targeted harassment and genocide.</p>

          <p>Sue Ring-Jarvi, a 74-year-old pioneer of women's hockey in Minnesota, continues to foster the sport's growth through a summer league she organizes for players aged 18 to 74. Having established the first women's hockey club at the University of Minnesota in 1974, before it was an NCAA-sanctioned sport, she has created a lasting community. The league not only keeps older players active but also brings families together, with multiple generations skating on the same team. Ring-Jarvi's dedication serves as an inspiration, demonstrating how a lifelong passion can build a supportive and enduring legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), conservative economist EJ Antoni, has proposed suspending the agency's influential monthly jobs report. Antoni, a vocal critic of the BLS, argued in an interview that the report is unreliable and should be replaced by less frequent but more accurate quarterly data until its methods are fixed. This suggestion has alarmed many economists, who view it as a move to undermine the credibility of key economic data used by investors, policymakers, and the public. The White House stated it hopes to continue monthly reports but reiterated criticisms of the agency's data collection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing rivalry between Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has intensified, with Musk now targeting Apple. Musk threatened "immediate" legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations for allegedly favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT over his own xAI's Grok in the App Store. Altman publicly refuted the claim, suggesting Musk manipulates his X platform to benefit his own companies and offering to see the matter debated under oath. This new front in their battle highlights the fierce competition in the AI sector and brings Apple's App Store policies back into the regulatory spotlight.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season later this week. As of Tuesday morning, the storm was located far from the U.S. mainland but was moving westward, with early models suggesting it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands. While the storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands, its long-term path remains uncertain. Forecasters are closely monitoring its development, with most models showing a potential turn toward the northwest, away from the U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that claims of victory regarding President Trump's tariff policies are unsubstantiated and ignore fundamental economic principles. The author refutes the administration's assertion that tariff revenue represents money "pouring in" from other countries, clarifying that these taxes are paid by American importers and ultimately consumers. While acknowledging that tariffs do generate revenue for the Treasury, the piece contends this comes at the cost of higher prices or reduced profits for U.S. businesses. The author concludes that declaring "Mission Accomplished" is premature, as the true negative impacts on the economy have yet to fully materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

Another popular option for those 70½ or older is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit that satisfies the RMD requirement.

The 1973 Home Rule Act granted D.C. an elected mayor and council, but Congress retained ultimate authority, and the president can assume emergency control of the police. Before this act, the city was run for a century by a presidentially appointed commission, a system implemented in 1874 amid pushback against rising Black political participation. Even after home rule, a federal "Control Board" took over the city's finances in the 1990s, highlighting the city's history of limited self-governance.</p>

          <p>Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported strong first-quarter earnings as a public company, with revenue surging 53% to $658.1 million. This growth was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. The positive results and a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration have boosted investor confidence, with the company's stock soaring since its June IPO. Circle also announced plans for a new proprietary blockchain called Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Five Key Factors to Consider Regarding Annuity Investment Safety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 12:55:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines five important considerations for those evaluating the safety of annuities as a retirement investment in the current economic climate. The safety of an annuity depends heavily on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, as they are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, it's crucial to diversify across highly-rated insurers. Different annuity types carry varying risk profiles, with fixed annuities being the most predictable. Finally, prevailing interest rates and the threat of inflation eroding purchasing power are critical factors to assess. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking monetary sanctions against a California-based immigration lawyer who attempted to block his client's deportation. The attorney, Joshua Schroeder, filed several emergency motions arguing his client, a Hmong man from Laos, would be in danger if returned. The DOJ's motion accuses Schroeder of making "meritless contentions" and acting in bad faith, marking a significant step in the Trump administration's pledge to crack down on immigration attorneys. This action is seen by advocates as an effort to intimidate lawyers and hamper legal opposition to the administration's aggressive deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have launched intense air and drone attacks on residential areas of Gaza City as they prepare for a ground occupation, according to the territory's civil defense agency. The bombardment has caused massive destruction, trapping residents and preventing the recovery of the dead and injured. Simultaneously, the UK, EU, and other allies issued a joint statement warning that "famine is unfolding" and demanding Israel facilitate immediate and permanent aid access. The World Health Organization has also appealed for permission to pre-stock medical supplies in Gaza's hospitals to handle the catastrophic health situation.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July indicated that overall annual inflation remained at 2.7%, as falling gasoline and grocery prices helped offset other increases. However, a closer look at the data reveals concerning trends, with "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy, rising to a 3.1% annual rate. Economists suggest that the effects of the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are beginning to surface in the prices of goods like apparel and furnishings. These impacts are expected to become more pronounced in the coming months, potentially pushing core inflation higher. (not investment advice)</p>

The 29-year-old, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, said that conversations with manager David Moyes were decisive in his choice to move to the club. After falling out of favor at Manchester City last season, the move provides Grealish an opportunity to secure regular playing time and rejuvenate his career.
