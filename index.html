        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Jersey Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver was indicted on three federal assault charges after a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges stem from an incident in May where McIver and other members of Congress attempted to oversee the detention center, leading to a scuffle between protesters and law enforcement. McIver is accused of assaulting federal law enforcement officers during the incident, including allegedly slamming her forearm into an agent and pushing an ICE officer. McIver denies the charges, calling the indictment a politically motivated attempt at intimidation. The Department of Homeland Security has released footage appearing to show McIver moving past an officer using her elbows during the incident. </p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has labeled California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit challenging the federal deployment of troops to enforce immigration laws as a "crass political stunt." The DOJ argues that Newsom's request for a temporary restraining order would countermand the President's military directives and give rioters a veto over federal law enforcement. Newsom contends that the deployment lacks legal justification, as there is no rebellion in Los Angeles that necessitates federal intervention. The DOJ maintains that the President's judgment on the necessity of federal reinforcements should be respected. </p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his New York retrial, while being acquitted on a similar charge regarding Kaja Sokola. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third charge involving Jessica Mann, leading the judge to instruct them to continue deliberations. The trial involved accusations from Haley, Mann, and Sokola, with all three women testifying about alleged sexual assaults. Weinstein's defense argued that the encounters were consensual, while prosecutors maintained that he used his power to coerce the women. The retrial occurred after Weinstein's initial 2020 conviction was overturned. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, gold became the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' growing appetite for the precious metal. Central banks' gold stockpiles are approaching levels last seen in the 1960s, and combined with rising gold prices, it now trails only the U.S. dollar in reserve holdings. Emerging and developing countries are increasingly attracted to gold due to concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies. While central bank purchases may slow, gold's role as a hedge against global fiscal, inflationary, and geopolitical risks is expected to sustain its attractiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An uneasy calm has settled over Los Angeles following a night of curfew, with nearly 400 people arrested in connection with immigration protests. Mayor Karen Bass attributes the unrest to President Trump's immigration raids, which she claims incited fear and panic among residents. National Guard troops and Marines have been deployed to assist in quelling the unrest, but they are only authorized to detain protesters, not make arrests. The military deployment is estimated to cost $134 million, and Trump has vowed to use every asset at his disposal to restore peace. </p>

          <p>After President Trump imposed tariffs, companies began paying billions more to bring goods into the country, with the Treasury collecting a record $22 billion in tariff payments in May. While the president has argued that tariffs can generate income for the government, House Republicans have suggested that the tariff revenue will be enough to offset the projected losses from their tax and spending bill. However, even May's haul remains a tiny share of the federal government's typical income, the vast majority of which comes from individual and corporate income taxes. </p>

Promises of painless revenue from tariffs have proven false, and the U.S.'s global standing is declining. The article argues that Trump's trade war is subordinate to his domestic culture war, and he is likely to blame fellow Americans for its failure.
