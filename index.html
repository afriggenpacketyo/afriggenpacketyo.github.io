          <p>Amid ongoing anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles, a group of federal ICE agents were denied entry to Dodger Stadium. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization confirmed that they denied the agents access to the parking lots, while the Department of Homeland Security stated that CBP vehicles were briefly present but unrelated to any operation involving the Dodgers. The incident follows growing criticism of the Dodgers for their silence on recent immigration raids in the city, which have sparked demonstrations, and comes as President Trump instructs ICE to oversee a mass deportation program. The police notified the Dodgers organization, which allegedly told the ICE agents to leave the property, according to KABC; however, a small group of federal agents were still at the location shortly after 11 a.m.</p>

          <p>A preliminary NTSB report reveals that a plane crash in May, which killed six people including musician Daniel Williams, occurred because the aircraft was flying too low during its descent. Contributing factors included faulty runway lights and potentially adverse weather conditions at the airport near San Diego. The pilot had discussed alternate airport weather conditions but did not notify Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control of his final decision. The aircraft struck power lines approximately 1.8 nautical miles from the runway, impacting a residential structure and several vehicles. The plane was not equipped with a flight data recorder, but a cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the wreckage.</p>

          <p>Several airlines, including United and American, have suspended flights between the U.S. and the Middle East due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. United Airlines has paused its Newark to Dubai flights, while American Airlines has temporarily suspended flights between Philadelphia and Doha through June 22. Delta Air Lines had previously suspended flights between New York's JFK and Tel Aviv until August 31. These suspensions come as Israel has been bombing nuclear and military targets in Iran, leading to airspace closures and a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel from the U.S. State Department.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering a strike on Fordo, Iran's secure nuclear site, believing disabling it is necessary due to the risk of rapid weapons production. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision is pending, contingent on potential negotiations with Iran to abandon its nuclear program. The U.K. is actively engaged in diplomacy, and Trump is aware of efforts involving multiple foreign ministers to present Iran with an offer. Intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, though the intelligence community has not confirmed an order to weaponize. Trump stated he would make a final decision within two weeks, emphasizing that his plans could change.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned from her position as a government whip in response to planned cuts to disability benefits. In her resignation letter to the prime minister, Foxcroft acknowledged the need to address the increasing welfare bill, but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. She stated that she had hoped to influence changes from within the government but had not seen the progress she desired. Her resignation highlights internal disagreements over welfare policies within the government.</p>

          <p>The film "28 Years Later," a reboot of the zombie franchise, presents a plot set nearly three decades after a viral outbreak isolated the British Isles. The story follows a family's struggle for survival and their encounters with both the infected and other humans. The film blends moments of philosophy with violence and comedy, creating a tonally ungainly yet intriguing spectacle. The filmmakers use abrasive editing and sound to evoke themes of struggle and division, suggesting that humankind's natural state is conflict, and the film explores the idea that the things that make us feel safe are also our weaknesses.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bag use have significantly reduced shoreline litter in the U.S. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that areas with bag policies saw a 25% to 47% decrease in plastic bag litter over six years compared to unregulated areas. The study suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, in limiting litter. This comprehensive review highlights the effectiveness of plastic bag policies in mitigating plastic pollution in marine environments.</p>

          <p>With the possibility of U.S. involvement in strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, attention has turned to the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a bunker-buster bomb. The MOP, designed to destroy deeply buried and hardened facilities, weighs nearly 30,000 pounds and can penetrate up to 200 feet underground before exploding. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is currently the only aircraft in the U.S. Air Force capable of carrying and deploying the GBU-57. The use of these weapons is controversial, with some arguing it would be provocative, while others believe it is necessary to eliminate Iran's ability to produce weapons-grade uranium.</p>

          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that President Trump will decide within two weeks whether to strike Iran, and Trump has demanded that Iran immediately shut down its enrichment operations and any other potential for producing nuclear weapons. Trump is weighing a potential strike on Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which is buried under a mountain and could be destroyed by US "bunker-buster" bombs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed confidence that Trump would "do what's best for America."</p>

          <p>Aid distribution in Gaza, managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has become increasingly dangerous, with hundreds killed in chaotic incidents. Since the GHF took over aid operations, over 400 people have been killed and 3,000 wounded during aid deliveries. Residents describe the situation as a "death race," with desperate individuals competing for limited supplies amid the risk of Israeli fire. The GHF's distribution methods, including dumping boxes on pallets and deploying armed contractors, have been criticized for contributing to the chaos and violence.</p>

Luna, who has been acting since childhood in Mexico, noted the lack of diverse representation for Latinx actors in the industry. He recounted being asked to alter his accent early in his career, a request that is now less common. Luna's presence in American productions has contributed to increased Latinx representation, though disparities persist, as Latinx people are often depicted in stereotypical roles.</p>
