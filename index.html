          <p>Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, is set to sign an executive order outlining the city's resistance to the Trump administration's immigration policies. The order will prohibit Chicago police from collaborating with federal agents on immigration enforcement and direct city departments to use all legal avenues to oppose federal efforts. This action responds to the White House's plan to intensify arrests of undocumented immigrants in Chicago and other "sanctuary cities," a strategy that Illinois' governor has condemned as an overreach of power and likened to an invasion.</p>

The 58-year-old celebrity chef shared a photo showing a large bandage on his face and neck, expressing gratitude to his medical team for its prompt removal. He took the opportunity to raise public awareness about sun safety, strongly encouraging his followers to use sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer often linked to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p>

          <p>A failed rebranding by Cracker Barrel, which was quickly reversed following intense public criticism, has reignited a long-standing cultural debate in the American South: which restaurant is superior, Cracker Barrel or Waffle House? The discussion gained national traction after political figures, such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, publicly endorsed Waffle House on social media. The article delves into the distinct cultural roles of both chains, featuring commentary from Southern chefs who analyze their different appeals, from menu variety to speed of service.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has canceled a planned trip to Beijing for a World War II anniversary event due to escalating domestic unrest. Protests, which initially started in Jakarta over lawmakers' pay, have now spread to other regions and become more violent, with reports of government buildings being set on fire. A presidential spokesperson announced that Prabowo will remain in Indonesia to monitor the situation and seek solutions. This marks the first significant political test for his government since it took office nearly a year ago.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has increased its offer for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi to £35 million, now including a 10% sell-on clause in the proposed deal. Crystal Palace has responded with a counter-demand for an additional £5 million in performance-related bonuses, and negotiations are ongoing ahead of the transfer deadline. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace, making a transfer highly probable as his current deal is set to expire next summer. The move could be finalized if Palace succeeds in signing two new central defenders.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan transfer to Bayern Munich, recalling him from Germany where he was scheduled to undergo a medical examination. The decision was prompted by a serious hamstring injury sustained by another Chelsea striker, Liam Delap, which left the team with only one available forward. This sudden reversal has reportedly left Jackson frustrated, as the £13 million loan deal was nearing completion. The incident underscores Chelsea's unexpected shortage of attacking players despite significant recent investments in their squad.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope integrated with artificial intelligence that can identify three significant heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—within seconds. The device captures the heart's electrical signals and analyzes subtle sounds beyond the range of human hearing, sending the data to an AI for immediate analysis. A comprehensive study involving over 200 general practitioner surgeries in London demonstrated that the device substantially improved the detection rates for these conditions. This innovation is hailed as a potential game-changer for early cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several local councils across the United Kingdom are continuing their legal efforts to block the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal decision against such a challenge. The court overturned an injunction that was secured by Epping Forest District Council, but the council is now exploring a further appeal to the Supreme Court. The use of hotels for this purpose has become a contentious national issue, sparking protests and counter-demonstrations in both England and Scotland as the government seeks sustainable long-term housing solutions.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Global Tariffs Unlawful</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 11:13:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has determined that President Trump's extensive "reciprocal tariffs" on most trading partners constitute an illegal use of his emergency powers. The court's ruling stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law cited by the administration, does not grant the president the authority to impose such levies. While the decision upholds a lower court's finding, it allows the tariffs to stay in effect until mid-October, providing time for a potential appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, creating significant economic uncertainty.

          <p>This article provides a guide to Social Security survivor benefits, explaining who is eligible and how the process works for those who have lost a spouse. Benefits are typically available to the surviving spouse, ex-spouse, or child of a deceased individual who paid Social Security taxes. Eligibility generally begins at age 60 for a surviving spouse, or 50 if disabled, with exceptions for those caring for young or disabled children. The article clarifies that one can start with survivor benefits and later switch to their own retirement benefits if the amount is higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the release of a comprehensive study that identified agricultural pollution as a primary cause of Iowa's water quality issues, public funding allocated for promoting the report's findings has been withdrawn. The two-year, $1 million study connected contaminants in drinking water to the state's influential farm industry and related health risks, such as high cancer rates. With over $400,000 of the budget remaining for public outreach, the funds were abruptly "zeroed out" without explanation, sparking concerns that officials are attempting to suppress the politically sensitive results.</p>

          <p>An ongoing severe drought in Iraq has caused a significant drop in the water level of the Mosul Dam reservoir, the nation's largest, leading to the discovery of 40 ancient tombs. Archaeologists estimate that these tombs are over 2,300 years old, dating back to the Hellenistic period. This finding represents a rare positive outcome of the climate crisis, as it provides researchers with access to historical sites that are typically submerged. Teams are now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts before water levels rise again.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Patterson, a veteran investor and former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, has voiced concerns that President Trump's actions could compromise the political independence of the Federal Reserve. She cautions that politicizing the central bank by appointing loyalists to advocate for lower interest rates could lead to severe, long-term economic damage. While markets might see a short-term benefit from lower rates, Patterson argues it would ultimately result in higher inflation, a devalued dollar, and decreased foreign investment, mirroring negative outcomes seen in other countries.

These rumors have been fueled by recent photographs showing bruised hands on the 79-year-old president, a condition the White House previously identified as chronic venous insufficiency. Although the president addressed a court ruling on his tariffs via social media, his lack of public appearances has raised questions about his well-being, which were further amplified by comments from the Vice President.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of Utah has issued a stay of execution for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate who was scheduled to be executed by firing squad. His attorneys successfully argued that his advanced dementia renders him mentally incompetent, meaning he cannot comprehend the reason for his execution, which would violate constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Menzies was convicted for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker. The court has now mandated a lower court to re-assess his competency, acknowledging the prolonged suffering this decision causes the victim's family.</p>
