        <p>Department of Homeland Security officials searched two dorm rooms at Columbia University following the deportation of a pro-Palestinian activist.  Columbia's interim president stated that no one was detained and nothing was seized, but the university was heartbroken by the event.  The search followed the Trump administration's cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts, contingent on changes to Columbia's student discipline and admissions processes.</p>
