          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing a decade-long increase in government debt and interest payment ratios. The credit ratings firm noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. This downgrade reflects concerns about the nation's long-term fiscal stability and the inability of political leaders to agree on measures to reverse the trend of increasing debt. The downgrade could impact investor confidence and potentially lead to higher borrowing costs for the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has extended its block on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan men detained in Texas, pending a challenge to their removals. The court's order grants an emergency injunction sought by migrants' lawyers, who argued the deportations violated the Supreme Court's previous ruling on adequate notice. Justice Kavanaugh concurred, suggesting the Supreme Court should resolve the underlying questions immediately. The ruling highlights ongoing legal battles over immigration enforcement and the use of wartime powers, emphasizing the need for due process in deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>The World Bank announced it would resume operations in Syria after Saudi Arabia and Qatar paid off Syria's $15.5 million debt. The bank had halted operations in Syria in 2011 due to the civil war, preventing access to development loans and technical expertise. The first project in the reengagement focuses on electricity access, addressing severe shortages plaguing Syria after years of conflict. This move aims to alleviate poverty, with the UN estimating that 90% of Syrians live in poverty and receive minimal state-supplied electricity.</p>

Conservatives are demanding deeper cuts in federal spending, including the elimination of clean energy tax credits and earlier work requirements for Medicaid recipients.

          <p>Congressional Democrats are attempting to block over $3 billion in proposed weapons sales to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, citing ethical concerns related to President Trump's business dealings. Senator Christopher Murphy introduced resolutions to block the sales, questioning a potential $400 million luxury jet gift from Qatar to Trump and an Emirati firm's investment in a cryptocurrency business linked to the Trump family. The lawmakers also criticized the UAE for its role in the war in Sudan, accusing it of supporting a paramilitary group involved in human rights violations. The Arms Export Control Act provides a procedural tool for Democrats to force a congressional debate on these issues.</p>

          <p>Consumer attitudes worsened in May, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline, despite President Trump's rollback of some tariffs. The University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment near its lowest level since a severe bout of inflation three years ago. The decline is attributed to inflation fears and recession warnings stemming from Trump’s initial tariff policies. Despite a recent trade agreement with China and easing inflation, uncertainty persists due to remaining tariffs and concerns about the economic outlook. This trend poses a risk to the wider economy, as consumer spending accounts for a significant portion of economic activity.</p>

          <p>A social media post by former FBI Director James Comey, featuring shells arranged to spell "86 47," has ignited controversy, with Trump administration officials suggesting it was a call for the president's assassination. While the term "86" originated as diner slang meaning to remove an item, it has evolved to mean "to eliminate or kill" in some contexts. Lexicologists argue that the murderous connotation is unlikely in this context, but Trump and his advisers interpreted the post as a threat. The incident highlights the ambiguity of slang and the ongoing animosity between Trump and Comey.</p>
