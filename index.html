          <p>Japan's core inflation rate increased to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years, driven by rising rice prices and staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. The Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates given price trends, while also citing the need to monitor closely the effects of U.S. tariffs. Masato Koike, economist at Sompo Institute Plus, expects core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a black-tie dinner for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, drawing criticism for potential pay-for-play practices. The event, held at Trump's private golf club, allowed investors who spent millions on the coin to gain access to the president, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Critics argue that Trump is using cryptocurrency to boost his personal wealth, while most $TRUMP investors have incurred losses. The gala occurred amid congressional debates over regulating cryptocurrencies, with some lawmakers acknowledging the Trump family's involvement in the crypto industry has complicated the legislation.</p>

Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day, totaling about 10 funerals per week, with improved rest schedules for the animals.

          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The provision, included in the tax and spending cut bill, would block federal judges from enforcing contempt citations if they had not previously ordered a bond. Democrats argue the measure would rob courts of their power. The bill comes as federal judges have opened inquiries about whether to hold the Trump administration in contempt for violating their orders in cases related to its aggressive deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>A young couple who worked for the Israeli Embassy were shot dead outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC. Police have charged Elias Rodriguez with the murders, reporting that he shouted "free, free Palestine" during his arrest. The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum when the shooting occurred. The event had been billed as a networking opportunity to bring Jewish young professionals and the diplomatic community together. The suspect had been working at the American Osteopathic Information Association since 2024.</p>

          <p>Elias Rodriguez, a Chicago resident, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killings of two Israeli Embassy aides outside a Jewish museum in Washington. Rodriguez was increasingly active in left-wing politics, posting on social media and joining demonstrations in Chicago in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza, large corporations and racism. Rodriguez told police officers, “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,” according to an F.B.I. affidavit filed in federal court. In 2017, he was photographed outside the home of former Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Chicago’s North Side, wearing a checked shirt and backpack, and holding a sign that read, “$ for people’s needs, not Amazon!”</p>

          <p>Kid Cudi testified in Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial, claiming that Combs coordinated the firebombing of his car due to jealousy over Cudi's brief relationship with Cassie Ventura. Cudi stated that Ventura confided in him about Combs' violent behavior. The trial also included testimony from Combs' former assistant, George Kaplan, who described witnessing abuse and said he quit after 15 months because he could no longer continue "fixing" problems for Combs after the mogul's repeated acts of violence. Makeup artist Mylah Morales also testified about witnessing Combs abuse Ventura in 2010.</p>

The event has been assailed by Democrats and even some Republicans as unethical. The dinner was arranged by Trump's business partners to enrich the first family. Some of the guests have a stake in how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States, and viewed the dinner as an opportunity to hear directly from Mr. Trump and gain insight into how they might expand operations in the United States, after Biden-era rules led many of them to avoid investments here.</p>

Valdo Calocane, who also has paranoid schizophrenia, stabbed to death Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates on 13 June 2023.

          <p>Millions of low-income Americans could lose access to food stamps or see reductions in their monthly benefits as a result of House Republicans’ newly adopted tax bill, according to an analysis released by the Congressional Budget Office. To save nearly $300 billion over the next decade, Republicans proposed a series of new rules that would tighten eligibility under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The work mandate could reduce participation in SNAP by more than three million people in an average month over the next decade.</p>

The USDA wants data including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers and addresses of all applicants and recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), going back more than five years. Plaintiffs say the USDA isn't following proper procedures for this kind of data collection effort, which include offering public notice, seeking public comment and publishing a privacy impact assessment ahead of time. The legal fight over SNAP data comes the same day as Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a massive bill that includes deep cuts to SNAP.</p>
