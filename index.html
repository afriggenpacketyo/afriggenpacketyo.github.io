          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, came after the discovery of a nodule during evaluation for urinary symptoms. While the cancer is advanced, it is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for management. Biden's family is reviewing treatment options with his physicians, and messages of support have been offered by political figures including Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Soko Hardware, a fixture in San Francisco's Japantown, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925 by Philip Ashizawa's grandparents, the store faced closure during World War II due to the internment of Japanese Americans. Ashizawa's father reopened the store after the war, and it has since become a community hub, offering Japanese imports and cultural items. Ashizawa, now passing the legacy to his children, emphasizes the store's role in connecting with neighbors and sharing Japanese heritage with visitors from around the world.</p>

The incident led BBC bosses to consider his position untenable, especially given previous controversies over his social media activity and the BBC's impartiality guidelines.

The move aims to support Israel's renewed military offensive against Hamas, named Operation Gideon's Chariot, while denying Hamas control over humanitarian aid distribution.

The NTSB has dispatched a go-team to investigate, and Senator Schumer is questioning whether staffing cuts in the Coast Guard may have contributed to the accident.

          <p>Michael Posner, former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, argues that President Trump's policies are undermining core American values. Posner criticizes Trump's proposed cuts to the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, which he believes will weaken America's ability to promote human rights and democracy abroad. He contends that these cuts will compromise the bureau's ability to act as a counterweight to regional State Department bureaus and U.S. embassies, which often prioritize diplomatic relationships over human rights.</p>

          <p>The House Budget Committee is reconvening to attempt to advance President Trump's domestic policy bill after conservatives initially blocked it due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while cutting Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to putting the legislation on the floor before Memorial Day, despite disagreements within the Republican party. Conservatives are pushing for Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies.</p>
