        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two blind women traveling from New Orleans to Orlando found themselves as the only passengers on their Southwest Airlines flight after a nearly five-hour delay. The women allege the airline "forgot about" them while other passengers were rebooked on an earlier flight from a different gate, raising concerns about the airline's communication protocols for passengers with disabilities. Southwest disputed the claim they were forgotten, stating the flight was the same one they were scheduled on, and offered a $100 voucher for the delay. The incident highlights the requirements of the Air Carrier Access Act for providing effective communication to all passengers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering significant changes to driving laws in England and Wales as part of a new road safety strategy. The proposals include requiring drivers over the age of 70 to pass compulsory eye tests every three years to renew their license. Additionally, the plan aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These measures follow a coroner's report that criticized the UK's current self-reporting system for vision problems as the "laxest in Europe."</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, scientists explain that newly formed black holes emit a unique form of "music" as they settle into a stable state. This phenomenon occurs when a new black hole, created from a star's collapse or a merger, rapidly sheds any initial irregularities in its shape, vibrating like a bell. This process, governed by its own powerful gravity, results in a distortion of space-time that is mathematically perfect, defined only by its mass and angular momentum. These "good vibrations" offer a way to study the properties of these enigmatic cosmic objects during their formation.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. Analysts suggest this policy will have a more significant impact in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger portion of household income. For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in the wealthy city of Shanghai. This economic incentive is expected to boost consumption and potentially birth rates more effectively in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal signals a potential easing of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, as the U.S. reverses a ban on these chips that was implemented over national security concerns.

The plan, approved by Israel's Security Cabinet, involves dismantling the last two Hamas strongholds while moving civilians to designated safe zones.

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas have experienced their warmest start to the year on record, a trend linked to climate change that is causing significant shifts in marine ecosystems. This sustained warmth has led to the observation of species not typically found in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. At the same time, native cold-adapted species like cod are being pushed to their limits and moving northward. Scientists warn that these marine heatwaves, made more frequent and intense by the burning of fossil fuels, are a clear indicator of an ecosystem in flux and pose challenges to local fishing communities.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance that appears to be closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing 7 of 14 passes and rushing seven times for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. In contrast, competing quarterback Taylor Heinicke struggled in his first preseason action, completing just one of five passes. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Lance's decision-making and the value he adds with his mobility, suggesting a real competition is emerging for the role behind starter Justin Herbert.</p>

          <p>The Lee Fire in western Colorado has grown to become one of the largest single wildfires in the state's history, charring over 167 square miles. The rapid growth of the blaze prompted the precautionary evacuation of all 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center, who were relocated to another facility. Over a thousand firefighters are battling the fire, which is being fueled by gusty winds and dry conditions, with containment remaining very low. Officials have issued air quality warnings for the region as they work to protect homes and infrastructure from the expanding, lightning-caused fire.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered an endangered spider monkey hidden in his vehicle during an inspection. The man, Juan Manuel Valdez, admitted to purchasing the monkey in Mexico and lacked the required permits for its importation. This incident underscores the persistent issue of illegal wildlife trafficking, which threatens endangered species, undermines conservation efforts, and poses risks of disease transmission. Spider monkeys are critically endangered due to habitat loss and the illegal pet trade, and authorities are increasing enforcement to combat such smuggling.</p>

          <h2>Mouse Study Suggests Potential Link Between Nose-Picking and Alzheimer's Disease Risk</h2>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a possible link between damaging the nasal tissue and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's-like symptoms. Researchers found that when the nasal lining was damaged, the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae could travel more easily from the nasal cavity to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In response to this infection, the mouse brains produced more amyloid-beta protein, the same protein that forms plaques in human brains affected by Alzheimer's. While the findings are yet to be confirmed in humans, they provide a new avenue for understanding the environmental factors that could contribute to the disease.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded that homeless individuals in Washington D.C. "move out, IMMEDIATELY," vowing to provide them with shelter "FAR from the Capital." This declaration is part of his broader plan to address what he describes as "out of control" crime and to beautify the city. The statement follows an order to deploy federal law enforcement to the city's streets and comes ahead of a planned news conference on the topic. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating that crime has been decreasing and criticizing the White House's rhetoric comparing the city to a war zone.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are strongly defending their Texas colleagues who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker labeled the mid-decade push to redraw congressional maps as "cheating" and an attempt by Republicans to "whittle away" at democracy. The new maps could give the GOP up to five additional House seats. In response to the Democratic lawmakers' exodus, which denies Republicans a quorum, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have them arrested upon their return and to call indefinite special legislative sessions until the matter is resolved.</p>

          <p>Vice President J.D. Vance has indicated that President Donald Trump is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a response to Beijing's continued purchases of Russian oil. While no firm decision has been made, the move is being reviewed as a potential way to increase pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The White House acknowledges the complexity of the issue, given the broader U.S.-China economic relationship. In response, Beijing's embassy in Washington stated that its trade with Russia is normal cooperation conducted within the framework of international law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal design. The footwear was inspired by huaraches, which are made by Indigenous artisans in Mexico, but was reportedly produced in China without consulting or crediting the originating communities. The issue drew condemnation, including from Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. In his apology, Chavarria expressed deep regret for not developing the shoe in direct partnership with the Oaxacan community, and Adidas has removed promotional images of the product.</p>
