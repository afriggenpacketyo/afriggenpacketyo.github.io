          <p>A 14-year-old was killed and another individual was hospitalized following a shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory. The incident occurred early Friday morning in the Casas del Rio student housing complex during a gathering of four people playing video games. An 18-year-old suspect was taken into custody by New Mexico State Police, with charges pending as the investigation continues. The university closed its central campus as a precaution and is offering counseling services to students and staff affected by the violence.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that one of two military-grade hand grenades recovered from a Santa Monica townhome complex is missing. The other device detonated last week, killing three veteran Los Angeles County Sheriff's detectives at a training facility. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has taken over the investigation into the unaccounted-for explosive, conducting extensive searches of the area. Officials are urging the public to report any suspicious objects but have stated there is no immediate direct danger to the community.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suggested the United Kingdom will participate in airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's approval for such deliveries from foreign nations. The announcement comes amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in the territory and political pressure from over 200 MPs to recognize a Palestinian state. While aid agencies caution that airdrops are an inefficient method, Starmer emphasized the government would "pull every lever" to deliver food and life-saving support. The UK has previously been involved in aid drops to the region in collaboration with Jordan.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a revitalized offense ahead of the upcoming trade deadline. After a slump earlier in the month, the team has now scored at least five runs in seven of its last ten games. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who delivered a run-scoring walk and a two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent surge with multiple hits. The win highlights the team's improving performance even as questions remain about potential roster additions.</p>

The referendum could potentially shift the balance of power in parliament, giving President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a majority. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups following controversial parliamentary reforms pushed by the KMT and accusations that the party is obstructing the government's agenda, including defense spending.

          <p>A decade after the city was captivated by the hunt for an elusive "Milwaukee lion," a new report of a large cat sighting has surfaced on social media. In July 2015, numerous reports of a "lion-ish creature" led to a wide-scale search that never resulted in a capture. This week, a user on the Nextdoor app reported seeing a big cat in Milwaukee's Riverside Park, reviving memories of the mystery. Wildlife officials note that while cougar sightings do occur as animals pass through urban areas, the original 2015 creature was never found, leaving its identity an enduring local legend.</p>

This "reverse migration" trend has led to the establishment of thriving expatriate communities and businesses in cities like Nairobi.

The California Public Utilities Commission stated that while Tesla can offer a "friends and family" car service under its existing permit, it must be a non-autonomous service with a human driver at all times. This distinction curtails the "robotaxi" concept in California for now, requiring it to function more like a traditional chauffeured service.

The suspension was handed down after Messi, along with teammate Jordi Alba, opted to skip the MLS All-Star game, citing the need for rest. According to long-standing league policy, players who decline an All-Star invitation without prior approval are ineligible for their club's next match. Mas called the punishment "draconian" and stated that the players did not understand why an exhibition game absence would lead to a competitive suspension, though the league commissioner defended enforcing the rule.</p>

The warm, dry conditions led to a surge in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and created ideal circumstances for butterflies, which saw their lowest recorded numbers last year. Experts note that 2025 has been an extraordinary year for early butterfly sightings.

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a dramatic plunge shortly after takeoff, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the maneuver, which the pilot later explained was an emergency action to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft after losing contact with air traffic control. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has confirmed it is investigating the incident, which reportedly involved a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The flight continued to its destination and landed without further issue, but the event marks another recent near-miss in U.S. airspace.</p>

          <p>A recent article explores whether strict adherence to popular health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water or walking 10,000 steps daily, is truly necessary. While some experts, like a kidney specialist, argue that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration, others maintain that targets help prevent issues like fatigue and brain fog. For sleep, experts are less flexible, stressing that seven to nine hours is vital for long-term health. The consensus suggests that while these benchmarks are useful for guidance, it's more important to incorporate a consistent, balanced, and personalized approach to health without becoming fixated on achieving perfect numbers.</p>

          <p>Tejano singer Bobby Pulido is considering a shift from music to politics, announcing the launch of an exploratory committee for a potential 2026 congressional run in South Texas. The "Desvelado" singer aims to challenge Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz as a Democrat, stating he is tired of politicians who prioritize party over people. Pulido, who studied political science before his music career, plans to host "ranch halls" to connect with constituents and focus on issues like comprehensive immigration reform and the local economy. He acknowledges that the Democratic party has previously taken Latino voters for granted in the region.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on how the female body is uniquely affected by elite athletic activity. Researchers are studying breast biomechanics, showing how proper sports bras can improve performance by reducing bounce and altering stride length. They are also investigating the complex, individualized impact of the menstrual cycle on performance and the higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears, in female athletes. This growing field of research marks a significant shift away from the old approach of treating female athletes as "mini-men," leading to better support, training, and performance.</p>

          <p>The asteroid 2024 YR4, once considered the riskiest object for a potential Earth impact, may now be on a collision course with the moon for late 2032. While an Earth impact has been ruled out, a lunar strike could create a visible explosion and a kilometer-wide crater, ejecting millions of pounds of lunar debris. This high-speed debris could create a meteor shower for Earth and pose a significant threat to satellites essential for communication and navigation, as well as any future lunar missions. The scenario is forcing planetary defense experts to consider expanding their monitoring to include threats to the moon.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the food aid boxes being distributed in Gaza by the Israel- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns among nutrition experts. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, lentils, and flour, provide sufficient calories for survival, they are critically lacking in essential vitamins and minerals. Experts describe the contents as a "'first aid' food basket" that, over time, could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like anemia and scurvy. The aid also requires cooking with fuel and water, both of which are in extremely short supply in the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make donations to reduce the public debt via the mobile payment app Venmo. The long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program provides a way for citizens to contribute beyond their taxes to help chip away at the nation's $36.72 trillion debt. While contributions since 1996 total around $67.3 million, a tiny fraction of the total, the addition of Venmo makes the process more accessible. The move offers a convenient, 21st-century method for patriotic citizens to help address the ever-growing national debt.</p>

          <p>Despite long-standing criticism, some psychologists and social experts are now arguing that reality television can have a positive impact on viewers. The genre often showcases more demographic diversity than other media, providing a window into different social landscapes and fostering greater understanding and empathy. By featuring ordinary people navigating complex emotional and social situations, these shows can destigmatize health conditions, raise awareness about issues like coercive control, and even reduce social isolation. While the potential harm to participants remains a serious concern, the content itself can spark important societal conversations and help viewers overcome personal biases.</p>
