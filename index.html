          <p>Wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly turning away from the US real estate market, redirecting their capital towards markets like Thailand, Australia, and Canada, according to property agents. This shift is attributed to rising geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, along with increased scrutiny of property deals. Data indicates a significant drop in Chinese investment in US homes, with buyers seeking friendlier and more stable alternatives. This trend reflects broader concerns about geopolitical friction and protectionism impacting investment decisions.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, enabling parents to use public funds for private school tuition. The program marks a significant victory for school choice advocates, offering families $10,000 per year, with up to $30,000 for children with disabilities. Supporters argue it expands educational options, while critics claim it diverts resources from public schools and benefits wealthy families. Starting next school year, the program aims to cover up to 90,000 students, potentially costing up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

Klein contrasts this with Trump's first term, which involved navigating a coalition government and advisors who occasionally curbed his impulses. The choice of Vance, Klein asserts, signals a shift towards an administration with no concessions or skeptics, emphasizing the ferocity and recklessness of Trump's presidency by design.</p>

          <p>Increased payroll taxes in Kenya are part of President William Ruto's effort to generate revenue to support the government and manage the country's foreign debt. The tax increases have led to a decrease in take-home pay for many Kenyans, causing widespread discontent, especially among those with low incomes. With much of the labor force working in the informal sector, the burden of these taxes falls disproportionately on salaried workers.

          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) is facing a crisis as it attempts to unseat leader William Lai Ching-te, amidst a surge in recall petitions and arrests of local officials. The pro-Lai supporters are targeting KMT legislators, while KMT officials are accused of forging documents in counter-recall efforts. The opposition has faced criticism for obstructing the Lai administration, raising concerns about Taiwan's ability to hold the executive branch accountable. The actions of the opposition coalition have also drawn concern from the United States and its allies, who have described the tactics as disruptive.</p>

          <p>Proposed tariffs by President Trump on imports from Vietnam are causing significant anxiety among factory workers and exporters, threatening the country's manufacturing-dependent economy. The potential imposition of a 46% tariff has already led to job cuts and frozen hiring as American retailers cancel orders. Vietnam's reliance on demand from the United States, which contributed significantly to its economic growth, makes it particularly vulnerable to these tariffs. Vietnamese leaders are seeking negotiations to avoid substantial damage to the country's economy and workforce.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, creating uncertainty about the broadcaster's future. The publicly funded broadcaster has been off air since March due to an executive order that led to the furlough of employees and termination of contractors. A lower court had previously ordered the administration to restore VOA operations, but the appeals court overturned that decision, stating the lower court lacked jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that this rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. The survey highlights the impact of this law on personal choices and legal benefits, as common-law couples lack access to tax deductions and inheritance rights available to legally married couples.</p>
