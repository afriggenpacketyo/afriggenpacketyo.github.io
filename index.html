          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker celebrated for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which debunked the myth of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has passed away at the age of 97. The film, released in 1969, explored the complexities of wartime Clermont-Ferrand through interviews with ordinary citizens, revealing collaboration and indifference towards the persecution of Jews and anti-Nazis. Initially banned from French television, "The Sorrow and the Pity" sparked controversy and critical acclaim, challenging the narrative fostered by Charles de Gaulle. Ophuls continued to direct documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," exploring themes of memory, justice, and the complexities of historical narratives.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) convened in Malaysia to address pressing regional issues, including concerns over U.S. tariffs and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. The draft statement from the summit chairman expressed deep concern over "unilateral tariff measures" without directly naming the United States, while Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim highlighted the strain on the global trading system due to recent U.S. actions. ASEAN trade ministers previously agreed not to retaliate against the tariffs, opting for a prudent stance to avoid escalating trade tensions. The summit also addressed the situation in Myanmar, where the junta and ASEAN have struggled to implement a five-point consensus for resolving the conflict.</p>

According to federal prosecutors, Neumeyer approached the embassy on May 19 with a backpack containing the incendiary devices but was confronted by a guard and fled, dropping the backpack. Law enforcement tracked him to a nearby hotel and arrested him, based on a criminal complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York. Neumeyer, who had traveled from the U.S. to Canada and then to Israel, had reportedly made threatening social media posts prior to the attempted attack.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD experienced a significant drop after the company announced price cuts on multiple electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, aimed at boosting sales, triggered concerns among investors about increased competition and a potential price war in the EV sector. Analysts expect the price cuts to drive increased foot traffic to BYD's dealerships, but other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline as investors reacted to the news. Despite the concerns, some analysts remain optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.

Xiaomi claims the YU7 will have a driving range of at least 760 kilometers (472 miles) on a single charge, surpassing Tesla's Model Y. Analysts anticipate that the YU7 will significantly erode Tesla's market share in China, especially given its expected price range of 250,000 yuan to 320,000 yuan ($34,700 to $44,420), which is competitive with the Model Y.

          <p>Japan has begun selling government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to rapidly decrease soaring prices and meet a target of 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. The move comes in response to public criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices, which have been exacerbated by a poor harvest and broader inflationary pressures. The new approach involves releasing approximately 300,000 tons of rice directly to major retailers, bypassing the auction system that previously limited the government's influence over prices. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to address the issue and prevent consumers from turning away from rice products.</p>

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old provision in U.S. customs law. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price of goods from the overseas producer to an intermediary, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the retailer. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariff regime, with companies exploring its potential cost savings. To apply the rule, businesses must demonstrate that at least two sales occurred, the sales were carried out at arm's length, the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price is available.</p>

The results, announced without evidence, stripped the opposition of key positions, including the governor's seat of Zulia. The electoral council claimed a turnout higher than 40 percent, despite near-empty polling places, and there were no independent observers to verify the assertion. Some Venezuelans said the low turnout signaled loyalty to opposition figure María Corina Machado, who had called for abstention. The announcement comes less than a year after Maduro claimed victory in a presidential election, despite evidence showing he lost to his opponent.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep enables the brain to eliminate harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, explains how hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), a metabolic by-product, signals the brain to switch to "repair mode" during sleep. The study confirms that increased H₂O₂ levels in sleep-regulating neurons trigger restorative slumber. This breakthrough offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases, as excess free radicals can disrupt sleep and cause inflammation.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Drew Gilpin Faust reflects on the original purpose of Memorial Day, formerly known as Decoration Day, and its significance in honoring those who died defending the promise of America. Drawing on Frederick Douglass's 1871 address at Arlington National Cemetery, the author emphasizes the importance of remembering what soldiers died for, particularly the preservation of democracy. At a time when democracy is again under threat worldwide, the author urges readers to consider the responsibilities passed down by historical figures like Douglass and Lincoln. The author suggests that we must uphold the legacy of those who sacrificed for freedom and stand up against threats to the principles they defended.</p>

The company employs a three-pronged approach, including auto-detection, human review, and community feedback, to identify and remove fake reviews. While vandalism accounts for some fake reviews, boosting and member fraud are more prevalent, with paid reviews being a smaller but more challenging category.
