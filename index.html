          <p>South Korea is holding a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979. The case re-examines whether his act was treasonous insurrection or a patriotic move to restore democracy, a question that has polarized the nation for decades. Kim's family argues he was tortured into a false confession and that his trial was politically motivated by the subsequent military regime. This retrial occurs amid contemporary concerns about South Korean democracy, potentially influencing how history judges a man who killed a dictator to prevent further bloodshed.</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League in the MLB All-Star Game, which was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time in history. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs to clinch the victory for the NL, earning him the MVP award despite going hitless during regulation play. The new tie-breaking format, introduced in 2022, was implemented to prevent games from running long and depleting pitching staffs. The event also featured the first use of the robot umpire challenge system in an All-Star Game.</p>

          <p>Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles increased by 24% in June compared to the previous year, with China and Europe driving the growth. A report from Rho Motion indicates that 1.8 million units were sold worldwide, with China accounting for 60% of the total after a 28% jump in its domestic market. In contrast, sales in North America experienced a 9% decline, positioning the U.S. market as a laggard in the global transition to electric mobility. For the first half of 2025, global EV sales are up 28% year-over-year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy soccer club has indefinitely banned several fans, including a prominent member of the Angel City Brigade support group, following protests at a recent match. The demonstrations, which included silent protests and walkouts, were organized to condemn the team's and owner AEG's perceived silence on recent mass immigration raids in Southern California. While the team states the bans are for harassment and unauthorized use of credentials, not for protesting, the actions have intensified tensions. Supporters are now planning a protest march before an upcoming game.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, halving the number deployed last month in response to protests against federal immigration raids. The Trump administration had federalized 4,000 troops, bypassing California's governor, a move that prompted a lawsuit from the state. California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment as political theater and called for the remaining troops to be sent home immediately. The administration stated the withdrawal is possible because "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding."</p>

          <p>The murder trial of Dr. James Toliver Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of poisoning his wife, began with conflicting portrayals of the victim, Angela Craig. Prosecutors argue that the dentist was a calculated killer who used cyanide to end his marriage and pursue an affair with a Texas orthodontist. In contrast, the defense depicted Angela Craig as emotionally manipulative and mentally unstable, suggesting her death could have been a suicide. The defense strategy aims to create reasonable doubt by challenging the prosecution's narrative and pointing to an incomplete police investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, part of a broader "Crypto Week" push by Republicans, aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market. Proponents, including large financial institutions and fintech companies, argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper payments. The bill's consideration signals a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream U.S. financial system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into what it calls Brazil's "unfair" trading practices. The probe, directed by the U.S. Trade Representative, will examine Brazil's policies on digital trade, electronic payments, preferential tariffs, and alleged interference in anti-corruption efforts. The action follows President Trump's recent call for Brazil to end the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and a threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. The investigation targets barriers that the U.S. claims harm American companies, workers, and innovators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles reveals that many Mexican citizens detained in recent immigration raids are long-term U.S. residents. Of 330 individuals interviewed, over half had lived in the U.S. for at least a decade, and more than a third had been in the country for over 20 years. Furthermore, nearly a third of those surveyed have U.S.-born children. The findings challenge the notion that these raids primarily target recent arrivals, highlighting instead their impact on individuals and families deeply integrated into American society and the Southern California economy.</p>

          <p>Leaders from UC Berkeley, Georgetown, and the City University of New York (CUNY) faced a contentious House committee hearing regarding antisemitism on their campuses. The university officials condemned antisemitism but strongly defended their obligation to protect free speech, stating that pro-Palestinian expression is not inherently antisemitic. Republican committee members accused the schools of failing to discipline faculty and staff, while Democrats criticized the hearing as "political theater." The hearing was the latest in a series scrutinizing university responses to campus protests and tensions following the October 7th Hamas attack and subsequent war in Gaza.</p>

The charges stem from evidence collected by federal police and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023.
