          <p>Shares of server manufacturer Super Micro Computer fell by 15% in after-hours trading following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter results. The company's earnings per share and revenue both missed analyst expectations, and its guidance for the upcoming quarter also fell short of projections. Despite this, Super Micro's revenue for the quarter still saw a 7.5% year-over-year increase, and its full-year revenue forecast for fiscal 2026 is above consensus estimates. The company, which saw a surge in demand for its AI-related servers in 2023, has experienced slowing growth recently. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a proposal to streamline the approval process for commercial drone use in U.S. airspace, aiming to foster innovation in areas like delivery services and infrastructure inspection. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the new framework, which would replace the current case-by-case waiver system that many in the industry find cumbersome. Under the proposed rules, commercial drones must meet specific safety standards, including collision avoidance technology, and will be restricted from flying over large public gatherings. The move is intended to establish clear regulations in what Federal Aviation Administration officials have described as a "Wild West" environment for drone usage.</p>

The subpoenas reference Bill Clinton's documented flights on Epstein's private plane and other connections as reasons for the summons. Other high-profile figures, including former attorneys general and FBI directors, have also been subpoenaed to provide depositions as part of the committee's broad oversight into the enforcement of sex trafficking laws.</p>

The 1,398 reports mark an all-time high, with significant increases in sexism, transphobia, and faith-based abuse. Reports of sexism and misogyny surged by 67%, while incidents in youth football also reached a record level, which the organization's CEO called a "wake-up-call." While overall racism reports fell, incidents in the professional game increased, prompting calls for football authorities and tech companies to take stronger action against abuse.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is cautioning the public after wild pigs in Monterey County were discovered with bright blue muscle and fat tissue. Officials believe the coloration is due to the pigs consuming anticoagulant rodenticide, a poison used in agricultural settings to control pests like squirrels. The substance, diphacinone, can be passed to predators and humans who consume the tainted meat, a risk that is not eliminated by cooking. Authorities are urging hunters not to consume any animal showing signs of this contamination and to report such findings immediately.</p>

          <p>Austin Drummond, a 28-year-old man suspected of killing four relatives in Tennessee, was arrested Tuesday, ending a weeklong manhunt. He faces four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his girlfriend's family members. The investigation began after a baby was found abandoned in a yard, which led authorities to discover the bodies of the victims. Drummond was found unarmed in a vacant building following multiple public sightings. A reward for his capture had grown to $32,500, and authorities had previously warned he was armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has blocked the Trump administration from redirecting $4 billion in funds from a FEMA program designed to help communities protect against natural disasters. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction sought by 20 states, which argued that FEMA lacked the authority to end the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that the administration had not shown it had the discretion to repurpose the congressionally allocated funds. The states warned that eliminating the program would jeopardize critical infrastructure projects and ultimately cost more in post-disaster recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to seek hate crime charges and the death penalty against the man accused of killing two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C. Sources indicate prosecutors will ask a grand jury to indict Elias Rodriguez on the enhanced charges for the May 21 shooting of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. To secure a hate crime conviction, prosecutors must prove the act was motivated by antisemitism, not just political opposition to Israel. Rodriguez allegedly shouted pro-Palestine slogans during the incident and told police he "did it for Palestine."</p>

          <p>The political practice of gerrymandering, or drawing electoral maps for partisan advantage, has escalated into a contentious national issue, as exemplified by the current standoff in Texas. Historically a part of U.S. politics, the process has become intensely combative, with the potential to determine control of Congress. This article explores how, in the absence of federal restrictions on partisan line-drawing, gerrymandering has transformed into a high-stakes political blood sport. The fight in Texas, where Republicans are seeking to create more GOP-leaning districts, is rippling out to other states and intensifying the national political divide.</p>

Both Hassett, a former economic advisor, and Warsh, a former Fed governor, have advocated for lower interest rates, a stance favored by Trump.

Harris is presented as a symbol of this discontent, struggling to appeal beyond a narrow progressive base and connect with the broader electorate needed to win a national election.
