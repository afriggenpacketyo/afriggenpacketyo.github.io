          <p>President Trump has declared a "public safety emergency" in Washington D.C., deploying 800 National Guard troops and placing the city's police under federal control. He cited a need to combat what he described as "complete and total lawlessness," pointing to crime and homelessness. However, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other Democrats have strongly contested this narrative, presenting data that shows a significant drop in homicides and that violent crime is at a 30-year low. The move has been criticized as an unprecedented and unjustified power grab, while advocates for the homeless express concern over the president's vague plans to clear encampments.</p>

          <p>Tesla has begun accepting orders in China for a new, longer-range version of its Model 3 electric vehicle, priced at a 14% premium over the basic edition. The new variant boasts an extended driving range of 830km, a high-performance battery from LG Energy Solution, and a more powerful single motor. This launch comes as Tesla faces intensified competition in the Chinese market, with its local deliveries having declined in July compared to the previous year. The company aims to bolster its position in the premium EV segment with this enhanced offering, with deliveries scheduled to start next month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In its first quarterly earnings report as a public company, stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group announced a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million. The strong performance was primarily driven by the growth of its USD Coin (USDC), the world's second-largest stablecoin. Despite the revenue jump, the company reported a significant net loss of $482.1 million, which it attributed to non-cash IPO-related charges for stock-based compensation and debt value adjustments. Following the announcement, Circle's shares saw a notable increase of over 7% in premarket trading, reflecting investor confidence in its core business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 06:59:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation rate dropped for the ninth consecutive month, reaching 1.55% in July, its lowest point since June 2017 and below analysts' expectations. The decline was largely attributed to a decrease in food price growth, providing the Reserve Bank of India with potential room for a more lenient monetary policy. This development comes as India's economy faces challenges from U.S. tariff policies. The central bank recently maintained its interest rate at 5.5% and projected a benign inflation outlook for the fiscal year, though economists note that potential U.S. tariffs could complicate future policy decisions.

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, according to the latest official figures, which show a 5.8% drop in job openings between May and July. This decline, observed across most industries, brings vacancies to their lowest level since early 2021, outside of the pandemic period. Despite the slowdown and a slight dip in payroll numbers, average wage growth remained steady at 5%, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%. Economists suggest the cooling is gradual, potentially indicating that the labor market is stabilizing after recent increases in business taxes and the minimum wage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five months after emerging from bankruptcy, Spirit Airlines has expressed substantial doubt about its ability to continue operations without securing more cash. The budget airline stated that adverse market conditions, including high domestic capacity and weak leisure travel demand, have created a difficult pricing environment. The company's financial performance is not improving quickly enough to meet creditor requirements, which could lead to defaults if it cannot raise additional funds. Spirit is now exploring options such as selling aircraft, real estate, or airport gates to generate the necessary liquidity to survive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals a significant increase in crime affecting UK pharmacies, with approximately 90% reporting a rise in shoplifting and aggression over the past year. The National Pharmacy Association found that 87% of the 500 pharmacies surveyed experienced intimidating behavior, and 22% reported physical assaults on staff. Pharmacy owners are calling for a stronger police response, citing endemic criminality that makes staff feel unsafe and hinders patient access to healthcare. This trend aligns with a broader increase in shoplifting across the UK retail sector, prompting calls for greater security and more effective law enforcement intervention.</p>

          <p>As Presidents Trump and Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, the state's history as a former Russian territory provides a unique backdrop. Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million, a decision driven by financial strain following its defeat in the Crimean War and the declining profitability of the region's fur trade. The territory was seen as a liability, and the sale was a strategic move to raise funds and avoid potential conflict with Britain. Initially ridiculed in the U.S. as "Seward's Folly," the purchase later proved to be a historic bargain with the discovery of gold and oil, transforming the territory into a resource-rich state.</p>

          <p>A new report from Bankrate highlights the significant financial penalty associated with poor credit, termed a "subprime tax." Americans with credit scores of 620 or below pay an average of $3,400 more per year in higher interest rates for products like mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as increased insurance premiums. Over a 30-year period, this financial burden can accumulate to over $100,000, underscoring the long-term value of maintaining a good credit score.

The administration justified the deployment by citing a law allowing presidential action during a "rebellion." The testimony from Maj. Gen.

Instead of mimicking authoritarian tactics, the article suggests Democrats should differentiate themselves by adhering to democratic norms and focusing on winning elections through more attractive policy platforms.

The author notes the hypocrisy that while a vast majority of Americans deem adultery morally wrong, a significant number still engage in it.

The event, described as a family affair as frontman Joel Madden is Richie's brother-in-law, reignited the band's creative fire. Now signed to Atlantic Records, where Grainge is CEO, the band is returning amidst a broader pop-punk revival. The Madden brothers, now 46, reflect on their changed priorities, with the new music exploring themes of family and devotion, a shift from the angst of their early-2000s hits.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that if Texas Republicans proceed with a partisan redrawing of congressional maps to gain seats, California must respond in kind to protect democratic balance. The author posits that Trump's push for this mid-decade redistricting is an attempt to subvert the electoral process and that California's "moral high ground" is meaningless without the power to counteract it. The piece supports Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal to redraw California's congressional lines, framing it as a necessary, strategic "tit-for-tat" response. The author contends that in the face of such actions, failing to fight back would allow an undemocratic power grab to go unchecked.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece counters the argument that Los Angeles should withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympics, labeling it a "bad idea." The author defends LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's recent cordial appearance with President Trump as a necessary act of diplomacy for the good of the city and the Games. The article recalls the historical success of the 1932 and 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, which both overcame significant global challenges and produced financial profits that benefited the local community. The author urges Angelenos to rise above political divisions and support the event, emphasizing that the focus should be on the athletes and the city's proven ability to host a successful Games.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's executive order to address homelessness by shifting individuals into long-term institutional settings is a flawed and cruel approach. The author contends that this policy ignores the country's sordid history with institutionalization and lacks evidence of effectiveness, while also criminalizing homelessness itself. In contrast, the article champions the "housing first" model, which prioritizes providing stable housing and support services without preconditions like sobriety. Citing multiple studies, the author asserts that this approach is not only more humane but also more cost-effective, saving the government money on healthcare and judicial costs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their tariff truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in their trade war. President Trump's executive order acknowledged that China was taking steps to address U.S. concerns, a sentiment echoed by Beijing. This extension keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods at 10%, providing more time for negotiations on complex issues like trade deficits, supply chains, and technology exports. Analysts suggest this move stabilizes the situation for consumers and businesses and could pave the way for a leadership summit between the two presidents later in the year.</p>

Foreign holdings of yuan-denominated bonds reached $587 billion by the end of May, rebounding from a low in 2023. Beijing has been actively simplifying procedures for foreign investment to attract more capital, and major global bond indices have been incorporating Chinese bonds, further integrating the market into the global financial system.

          <p>President Trump has indicated he would be open to allowing Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its most advanced AI chip, the Blackwell system, to the Chinese market. Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested a deal could be made if the chip's performance was reduced by 30% to 50%. This development follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. The move could represent a shift in the U.S. chip export policy, which has previously blocked Nvidia's most powerful semiconductors from being sold to China.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent vow to remove homeless encampments from Washington, D.C., has sparked alarm among advocacy groups due to the lack of clear details. While Trump stated the homeless would be given places to stay "FAR from the Capital," his administration has not provided a concrete plan regarding where people will be moved or what resources will be provided. Advocates for the homeless worry this could lead to punitive measures, such as simply displacing people without offering viable housing solutions. They argue that dismantling encampments is counterproductive and disconnects individuals from essential services, ultimately failing to address the root causes of homelessness.</p>
