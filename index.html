          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave saw its stock climb over 5% following the announcement of a planned $1.5 billion bond sale. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, is intended for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center in Pennsylvania, reflecting strong investor confidence. The company's shares have more than tripled since its Nasdaq debut, though some investors remain concerned about its debt levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, widely known for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54. Officials in Costa Rica confirmed his death was an accidental drowning that occurred on Sunday afternoon off the Caribbean coast. Warner was reportedly caught in a sea current and, despite assistance from others at the beach, was pronounced dead by Red Cross staff. His role on the iconic sitcom earned him an Emmy nomination and was a significant part of a legacy he remained proud of throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Grassley has released declassified documents suggesting the FBI, under then-Director James Comey, failed to properly investigate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. The documents, part of an appendix to a 2018 DOJ report, allege the FBI neglected to review key evidence, including thumb drives containing sensitive government information. The release claims the FBI also did not seriously pursue intelligence reports alleging the Obama administration tried to hinder the investigation. Grassley stated the documents reveal a stark contrast to the investigation into Trump-Russia collusion allegations.</p>

          <p>The England women's national football team, the Lionesses, will no longer take the knee before matches as they believe the anti-racism gesture is no longer effective enough. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated the decision was made because the impact was not as significant as desired. The move comes after defender Jess Carter revealed she had received racist abuse online during the Euro 2025 tournament. The team will stand at kick-off instead, hoping this change will spark new conversations and pressure for more substantial action against racism in football.</p>

          <p>This article details the maximum amounts students can borrow through federal student loans, highlighting the increasing gap between these limits and the actual cost of college. It breaks down the annual and lifetime borrowing caps for dependent, independent, and graduate students, noting that federal aid often falls short of total expenses. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while average annual college costs can exceed $38,000. The article suggests private student loans as a way to cover the remaining costs but advises borrowers to proceed cautiously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sentencing hearing is set for Brett Hankison, the former Kentucky officer convicted of using excessive force during the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor. Hankison's shots did not hit anyone but entered a neighboring apartment. The U.S. Justice Department has controversially recommended no prison time, suggesting only one day served and three years of probation, a move civil rights advocates have condemned. This recommendation marks a significant shift from the prosecution's earlier stance and means no officers involved in the raid may serve prison time for the incident.</p>

CEO Russell Weiner stated that while other restaurants struggle, the current economic headwinds are "tailwinds" for Domino's, as it successfully attracts customers across all income levels.

The book contrasts the island's image as a luxury playground with its reality as a sacred homeland for a community of over 1,000 tribal members.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he will not support a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team changes its name back to the "Redskins." In a series of social media posts, Trump called the "Commanders" moniker "ridiculous" and demanded an immediate reversion to the original name. The threat comes as a bipartisan bill could allow D.C. to lease the land at the former RFK stadium site for a new venue. Native American advocacy groups criticized Trump's remarks as political theater that ignores the dehumanizing nature of the former mascot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be effective in treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients report improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management difficulties. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps regulate hormone levels, including testosterone. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, these drugs could represent a significant breakthrough, though more extensive research and challenges with insurance coverage remain.</p>

          <p>This article reviews the long-documented social relationship between Donald Trump and the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, which spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The two frequently socialized in New York and Palm Beach, with Trump once calling Epstein a "terrific guy." A recent report details a 2003 "birthday book" for Epstein containing a message attributed to Trump referencing "things in common" and a "wonderful secret," which Trump has denied and is suing over. While their friendship reportedly ended in a bitter dispute in 2004, their past association continues to draw public and media scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 25 nations, including the U.K., Canada, and Japan, has issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza. The statement sharply criticizes Israel for the "inhumane killing of civilians" and what it calls the "drip feeding of aid," which it claims is dangerous and deprives Gazans of dignity. The nations condemned the continued detention of hostages by Hamas while also stating that Israel must comply with international humanitarian law regarding aid delivery. Israel rejected the statement as being "disconnected from reality" as it expands its ground operations in central Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has named former biotech executive and physician-scientist George Tidmarsh as the new director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This crucial division oversees the approval of most new drugs. The appointment comes amid significant upheaval at the FDA under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background is seen as a potential reassurance to the pharmaceutical sector, and his past comments suggest he may take a stricter stance on certain regulatory pathways, such as the controversial accelerated approval process.</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the Trump administration are engaged in a legal battle in a Boston federal court over more than $2 billion in frozen federal funding. The administration halted the funds, demanding Harvard alter its policies on hiring, admissions, and diversity programs to combat what it terms antisemitism. Harvard has sued, arguing the White House is unconstitutionally infringing on its academic freedom and has asked for a swift ruling. A government lawyer argued that federal funding is conditional on supporting government policies, a stance the judge appeared to view with skepticism regarding its constitutional implications.</p>

Unlike simple buy-and-hold strategies similar to MicroStrategy's for bitcoin, this firm will focus on generating yield through staking. Staking involves using the ether holdings to help secure and operate the Ethereum network in exchange for rewards. Backed by several crypto investment firms, the company argues this makes ether a more "productive" asset than bitcoin, offering investors exposure to both price and a form of dividend.

          <p>The Texas Legislature is meeting in a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, an effort pushed by President Trump's team to increase the Republican majority in the U.S. House. The move comes just a few years after the last redistricting cycle and follows a Justice Department letter alleging the current map contains unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Critics argue the effort is a purely political maneuver to secure more GOP seats ahead of the midterm elections and that it could undermine the voting power of communities of color, likely leading to significant legal challenges.</p>
