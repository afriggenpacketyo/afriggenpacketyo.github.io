          <p>Dan Tana, born Dobrivoje Tanasijević, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood Italian restaurant that became a celebrity hotspot, has passed away at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. A former professional soccer player and actor, Tana opened his namesake eatery in 1964, creating a late-night dining destination for stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. The restaurant, known for its classic red-sauce Italian-American fare and discreet service, has remained an L.A. institution, celebrated for its timeless charm and history even after Tana sold it in 2009.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi, scheduled for late August, has reportedly been called off as trade frictions between the two nations escalate. This development follows President Trump's imposition of a cumulative 50% tariff on Indian exports, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India, which considers the U.S. its largest export partner, has criticized the tariffs as unfair, pointing out that American and European allies also continue to trade with Russia. A new date for the crucial trade negotiations has not yet been finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening to a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. While currently lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain, the storm is forecast to remain a major hurricane as it tracks northwest between Bermuda and the U.S. mainland. Although most models predict Erin will stay well offshore, it is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the East Coast from August 20 to 27, posing a significant risk of coastal erosion.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting in Alaska, President Donald Trump has reportedly expressed support for a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin that would see Moscow take full control of Ukraine's Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would freeze the front lines in other occupied territories like Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as part of a permanent peace agreement. This marks a significant shift, as Trump is now advocating for a direct peace deal over a temporary ceasefire, a move that aligns with Russia's long-stated goals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected ceding territory, is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' performance was marred by significant errors, including three runners caught stealing in the first two innings and a costly dropped fly ball that allowed two runs to score. Former Padre Blake Snell pitched six shutout innings for the Dodgers, who capitalized on San Diego's sloppy play and numerous walks issued by their pitcher. The win clinches the season's head-to-head series for the Dodgers against their division rivals.</p>

After his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump abruptly shifted from demanding a ceasefire to pushing for a direct peace agreement, reportedly based on Ukraine ceding the Donbas region. This development has alarmed Kyiv, as it suggests Russia could leverage its battlefield advantage during negotiations while the conflict continues. Zelenskyy must navigate the talks carefully to avoid being portrayed as an obstacle to peace while resisting pressure to surrender sovereign territory.</p>

          <p>Doctors across the United States are reporting a significant increase in tick bites and associated medical visits this summer, prompting renewed warnings about prevention and proper removal. According to the CDC, May saw the highest rate of tick-related ER visits since 2019, with 134 per 100,000 total visits. Experts attribute the rise to factors like ticks migrating into more populated areas and warmer, more humid conditions creating a longer and more active tick season. Since ticks can transmit diseases like Lyme, health officials urge the public to use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, and perform thorough checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the costumed "Zombie Hunter," has been convicted and sentenced to death for the brutal murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s. The long-unsolved "Phoenix canal murders" were cracked after two decades thanks to advancements in genetic genealogy that linked Miller's DNA to the crime scenes. His defense admitted he was the killer but argued for insanity, claiming he suffered from dissociative amnesia due to severe childhood abuse by his mother. Prosecutors countered this by highlighting his memory of other violent attacks and testimony from his ex-wife about his deviant and violent behavior.</p>

This move is part of a broader federal crackdown on what President Trump has described as a crime and homelessness emergency in the nation's capital. The deployment follows an executive order that federalized local police and activated the D.C. National Guard, a decision that has been met with protests from residents and legal challenges from city officials. Critics argue the intervention is a political overreach, as data shows violent crime in the city has been declining.</p>

The ban, which makes support for the group a criminal offense, has led to over 700 arrests. While rights groups like Amnesty International have criticized the move as disproportionate and a threat to free expression, Cooper argues the group's "Underground Manual" encourages attacks and evasion of law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese design for a hypersonic drone carrier proposes a revolutionary "scissor wing" concept, reviving a dream once pursued by NASA. The aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At takeoff and subsonic speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as it approaches Mach 1, it pivots to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shock waves. At hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel with the fuselage, allowing the entire vehicle to function as a highly efficient "waverider" for stable high-speed flight.</p>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological drivers that can lead people, even those who consider themselves "good," to risk their careers and families for an affair. These factors include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to meet societal expectations ("always being good") and the burnout from perfectionism, which is often a response to childhood trauma. Other triggers are having poor boundaries developed from being a "parentified child," seeking reprieve from an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage, and reassessing life priorities after a significant loss, such as the death of a parent.</p>

Many families rely on local food pantries and council-issued food vouchers to bridge the gap left by the absence of subsidized school meals.

          <p>Claire's, the accessories chain once a staple for tweens and teenagers, has appointed administrators in the UK and Ireland after struggling with falling sales and intense competition. The company's 306 stores in the region will continue trading for now as it seeks a path forward, though online sales have been halted. For decades, the brand was a go-to destination for affordable jewelry, ear piercing, and glittery accessories, but it has faced challenges from fast-fashion giants like Shein and a shift in youth culture towards social media trends and more premium brands. Many former customers recall the store as a nostalgic part of their youth.</p>

          <p>Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston was carted off the field after sustaining a concussion during a preseason game against the Rams. The injury occurred on the third play from scrimmage when Johnston took a helmet-to-chin hit from a Rams safety while attempting to catch a deep pass. After being attended to by medical staff, he was taken to a local hospital for precautionary checks. The game, which the Chargers ultimately lost 23-22, also saw quarterback Justin Herbert make his career preseason debut, playing briefly in the first series before handing off to the backups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing hot weather, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, such as leaves turning yellow and berries ripening ahead of schedule. Experts suggest this is not a true seasonal shift but rather a stress response from nature to one of the warmest and driest summers on record. The prolonged heat and drought have caused trees to shed leaves and branches to conserve energy, a phenomenon known as "summer branch drop." While some crops have thrived, the unusual conditions are creating a chaotic environment for wildlife, potentially impacting the food supply for birds and bees heading into winter.</p>

          <p>A homeless man in Washington D.C. was forced to relocate after President Trump posted a photo of his tent encampment on social media and subsequently announced a city-wide crackdown. Bill Theodie, 66, was unaware his picture had been used as a "political tool" until a reporter showed him the post. Days later, he and other residents of the encampment, which was on the president's route to his golf club, were told to leave immediately as a bulldozer was brought in to clear the site. This action is part of Trump's new initiative to remove homeless encampments, which critics argue is a flawed approach.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has been held in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter and protracted legal battle between his children from two different marriages. Following his death in 2013, his sons accused his second wife and their daughters of poisoning him to inherit his estate, prompting a formal investigation and the exhumation of his body. This week, a magistrate concluded a decade-long inquest, ruling that the cause of death could not be determined due to decomposition. The court ordered the body released to the family, but with the two sides still fighting, his final resting place remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A group of students about to receive their GCSE results have opened letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2021. The letters, part of a time capsule project initiated by their teacher, reveal the anxieties and hopes of 11-year-olds navigating a disrupted start to secondary school. Students reflected on wearing face masks, being in school 'bubbles,' and their dreams for the future, with questions ranging from "Do you have a girlfriend yet?" to aspirations of attending university. The exercise served as a poignant reminder of their resilience and personal growth through the pandemic-affected years of their education.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin during their summit in Alaska, addressing the plight of children affected by the war in Ukraine. While officials indicated the letter raised concerns about the abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia, the released text is more abstract, appealing to Putin to "restore their melodic laughter" and protect their innocence. Ukraine's foreign minister expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the issue. The letter comes as Russia faces international condemnation for the forcible transfer of thousands of Ukrainian children, a practice considered a war crime.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile, is confronting its horrific past as it operates as a tourist destination. Formerly known as Colonia Dignidad, the site was home to an abusive religious sect led by Paul Schäfer and served as a torture center for political prisoners during the Pinochet dictatorship. The Chilean government now plans to expropriate part of the land, including buildings used for torture, to create a memorial, a move that has divided the remaining residents. While victims' families support the plan to create a site of memory, some current residents, who were also victims of Schäfer's regime, fear the expropriation will displace them once again.</p>
