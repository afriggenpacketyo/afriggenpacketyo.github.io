          <p>Atlassian has announced its acquisition of The Browser Co., the startup behind the Arc web browser, for $610 million in cash. The Browser Co. created Arc, a customizable browser with AI features, aiming to improve the user experience for work-related tasks. Atlassian's CEO, Mike Cannon-Brookes, believes current browsers are not optimized for work, while The Browser Co. hopes its technology will have a wider impact. The deal is expected to close by December, integrating Arc's features into Atlassian's suite of products.</p>

          <p>Orsted, a Danish renewable energy company, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the obstruction of its offshore wind farm project off the New England coast. The Interior Department ordered Orsted to cease construction on Revolution Wind, a nearly complete project that would power over 350,000 homes. Orsted argues the stop-work order is unlawful and was issued in bad faith, citing extensive environmental and safety reviews affirming the project's soundness. The lawsuit seeks to overturn the order and allow the wind farm's completion.</p>

Pulte stated that disclosing sources would be reckless, amid concerns his actions appear politically motivated. Trump sought to remove Cook from the Fed Board based on Pulte's allegations, which Cook denies and is fighting in court. Pulte defended his actions, claiming referrals are routine, but his social media activity suggests a targeted approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Urges Supreme Court to Expedite Ruling on Worldwide Tariffs</h2>

          <p>President Trump is asking the Supreme Court for a swift decision on his authority to impose tariffs on goods from around the world. Despite losing in lower courts, Trump believes the conservative justices will favor strong presidential power in foreign policy. The appeal argues that delaying a ruling could disrupt the economy, citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's warning about potential economic consequences. Lower courts have ruled against Trump, citing Congress's constitutional power over taxes and the lack of explicit tariff authority in the 1977 emergency powers law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The high school reunion, once a staple of popular culture, is now viewed by some as a dying tradition, challenged by the rise of social media. However, reunions persist, with many people feeling obligated to attend despite not knowing why. The author reflects on their own ambivalence towards reunions, contrasting it with their mother's positive experience of rekindling a high school romance. The article explores the motivations behind attending reunions, suggesting they serve as autobiographical occasions for self-reflection and comparison.</p>

          <p>Gloucester, Massachusetts, is experiencing a pervasive 'rotten egg' odor due to the decay of Heterosiphonia japonica, an invasive Japanese seaweed. Hurricane Erin pushed large amounts of the seaweed onto the North Shore, where high tides carried it into the Good Harbor estuary. The decaying seaweed releases a foul odor, prompting complaints from residents who compared it to gas or sewage. Officials expect the smell to gradually dissipate as the seaweed decomposes.</p>

The rise of fentanyl has shifted the focus from the traditional heroin production areas, with the Sinaloa cartel playing a significant role.

          <p>Africa loses an estimated US$88 billion annually through tax evasion, money laundering, and corruption, hindering economic growth. Analysts say this deprives governments of revenue for public services and promotes corruption. While efforts to curb these losses are underway, such as automatic exchange of bank information, challenges persist. The AU has created several instruments to combat illegal transactions, but these have not been efficient. The global geopolitical changes over the past ten years have made Africa even more vulnerable.</p>
