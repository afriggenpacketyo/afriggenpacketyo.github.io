          <h2>UK Faces Flash Flood Threat Amid Yellow Weather Warnings for Rain and Thunderstorms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 17:28:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a recent heatwave, the UK is experiencing unsettled weather with yellow alerts for rain and thunderstorms issued across the country. The Met Office warns of potential flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruptions, as the parched ground is less able to absorb heavy rainfall. While a more severe amber warning for London did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts remain possible throughout the weekend and into Monday. These conditions follow a period of extreme heat that led to hosepipe bans in several regions.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been ousted from his position at the Pentagon. Fulcher, who initially joined as part of Elon Musk's government efficiency initiative, is the latest official to leave following a staff shakeup in the wake of a scandal involving sensitive military plans being shared on the Signal messaging app. In a statement, Fulcher indicated his departure was planned after six months of service, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to work with the Defense Department. The changes come after other key aides were fired or reassigned in March.</p>

          <p>A man intentionally drove a car into a crowd outside The Vermont music venue in East Hollywood, injuring at least 30 people, with several remaining in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday after the individual was reportedly removed from a nearby business. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him, during which he was shot by an unidentified person who then fled the scene. The driver is in custody and will face charges of assault with a deadly weapon, while police continue to search for the shooter.</p>

          <p>A Virginia man, Brad Spafford, has pleaded guilty to federal weapons charges after authorities discovered approximately 150 pipe bombs and other explosives at his residence, one of the largest such seizures in FBI history. Prosecutors alleged that Spafford had made threatening comments, including cheering for political assassinations and using a photo of former President Joe Biden for target practice. Despite his defense's arguments for release based on his lack of a prior criminal record, a judge deemed him an "extreme danger," and he has been in custody since December. He now faces up to 10 years in prison for each charge.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air.

Perry maintained her composure, quickly continued the performance, and flew back to the stage without further incident. After the song, she humorously commented on the scare, demonstrating professionalism in handling the unexpected equipment failure during her "The Lifetimes Tour."</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The lawsuit stems from an article alleging Trump signed a "bawdy" birthday letter for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump has vehemently denied as "FAKE." The suit claims the report was false and defamatory, highlighting the high legal standard for public figures in such cases, which requires proving "actual malice." Dow Jones has expressed full confidence in its reporting and stated it will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered an eventful third round at The Open, keeping his slim title hopes alive with a score of 66 to finish at eight under par. His day included a bizarre moment on the 11th hole where his swing unearthed a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey. However, he quickly recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th, producing one of the loudest roars of the tournament from the supportive Portrush crowd.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa sanctions on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula described the US action as unacceptable "interference" in another country's justice system and a violation of sovereignty. The sanctions were imposed by the Trump administration after Judge Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic monitor while awaiting a verdict on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election. The move escalates diplomatic tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Flanker Tom Curry delivered a powerful and aggressive performance that was instrumental in the British and Irish Lions' 27-19 first-Test victory against Australia. Responding to recent criticism about his form, Curry was described as a "man possessed," making immense contributions in his 58 minutes on the field, including a crucial tackle that set up an early penalty. Coach Andy Farrell praised Curry and fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne as "immense," highlighting their role as big-game players. Curry's warrior-like intensity set the physical tone for the Lions and was a key factor in their win.</p>

          <p>Protests across five UK cities against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization have resulted in nearly 100 arrests. In London, 55 people were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses for displaying placards supporting the group. The government banned Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act after its members broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. The demonstrations, where many protesters held signs reading "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," occurred ahead of a High Court challenge to the ban filed by the group's co-founder.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A's handling of slow play at The Open, calling the enforcement inconsistent. Both players were warned about their pace during the third round, a day after another golfer was controversially penalized. Stenson noted the irony of being pushed for being minutes behind schedule on Saturday when earlier rounds had run nearly an hour over their allotted time without issue. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing the current approach is unfair and that officials are afraid to expose the reality of play times.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians seeking food, killing 32 people near aid distribution centers in southern Gaza. The incidents occurred as people gathered near hubs operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed by the U.S. and Israel. The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after groups approached its forces and that it was investigating. This event adds to the hundreds of deaths reported under similar circumstances, compounding the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and risk of famine in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>The article explores Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Christian movement of young activists who promote "chastity before marriage" to their peers in unconventional settings like the Jersey shore. These Gen Z members engage beachgoers in conversations about love and relationships, aiming to present chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity in a hyper-sexualized, social media-driven world. The piece examines the challenges they face in an increasingly secular society where premarital sex is widely accepted. It also delves into how their message taps into Gen Z's anxieties about modern dating and the search for authentic connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are fanning concerns over unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners, echoing nationalist movements in the US and Europe. While Japan faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, these groups argue against relying on foreign workers and advocate for a "Japanese First" policy. This rhetoric resonates with some voters who are frustrated with economic issues and perceive foreigners as a threat to cultural norms. (not investment advice)</p>
