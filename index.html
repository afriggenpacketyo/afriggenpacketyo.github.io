          <p>Joby Aviation is significantly expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities, aiming to launch air taxi service by 2026. The company is initiating production at a new components facility in Dayton, Ohio, and plans to double capacity at its Marina, California, manufacturing hub, which will eventually produce up to 24 aircraft annually. This strategic move, supported by a $500 million deal with Toyota engineers to help ramp up production to 500 annually in Ohio, underscores Joby's commitment to American innovation and job creation. The expansion coincides with the successful flight of its sixth aircraft, reflecting growing investor interest in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology.</p>

          <h2>Trump-Supported Cryptocurrency Legislation Stalls in House Vote</h2>

          <p>Several cryptocurrency-related bills, backed by President Donald Trump, encountered a significant setback in the House of Representatives after failing a key procedural vote with a 196-223 tally. This unexpected outcome, which saw 13 Republicans vote against the measure despite Trump's urging, dealt a blow to the crypto industry and led to a decline in related stock values. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene notably opposed the "GENIUS Act" for not including a Central Bank Digital Currency ban and for restricting amendments. House leadership plans another vote, but the incident highlights internal party divisions on digital asset regulation, impacting market confidence.</p>

          <h2>Circle Stock Declines Following House Block of Crypto Legislation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle experienced a notable decline on Tuesday after the U.S. House of Representatives failed to clear a key procedural hurdle for long-awaited cryptocurrency legislation. This development represents a significant setback for the digital asset industry, which had been anticipating clearer regulatory guidelines from Washington D.C. Despite the day's drop, Circle's shares still show a substantial increase from their public market debut last month, indicating strong underlying interest. The market's immediate negative reaction highlights the sensitivity of crypto-related investments to legislative and regulatory uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two individuals were tragically discovered shot to death inside a Los Angeles home in Encino on Monday afternoon, following a welfare check conducted by police. Both victims were found with gunshot wounds to the head, and a broken sliding glass door at the residence suggested forced entry. The Los Angeles Police Department has initiated a double homicide investigation, though no arrests have been made in connection with the incident. Authorities are currently in the process of notifying the victims' next of kin, and their names have not yet been publicly released as the investigation remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the UK government has published data detailing the immigration status of Universal Credit (UC) claimants, a benefit assisting both employed and unemployed individuals with living costs. The figures reveal that in June, nearly eight million people received UC, with 83.6% being British and Irish nationals, while over a million claimants were born overseas. This includes approximately 700,000 EU citizens with pre-Brexit residency rights and smaller percentages of refugees and those on safe routes. The data, released amidst political pressure, shows a consistent proportion of overseas-born claimants since April 2022, prompting calls for stricter welfare system controls.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the Trump administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume AI chip sales to China is strategic, ensuring China receives only the company's "fourth best" technology. This approach aims to keep Chinese companies reliant on the American "tech stack" while preventing them from developing superior homegrown infrastructure. Nvidia's H20 chip, a modified version of its Hopper-generation chips, will be sold, with Lutnick emphasizing the goal is to keep Chinese developers "addicted" to U.S. technology. This reversal, following a meeting between President Trump and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, is a significant win for Nvidia, which had faced an effective market closure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly stated that Ukraine should not target Moscow with strikes, seeking to clarify earlier reports that he privately encouraged escalation against Russia. The White House explained that Trump was "merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing" during a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This article follows Trump's recent commitment to send weapons to Ukraine and his ultimatum threatening 100% secondary tariffs on Russia's remaining trade partners if a ceasefire is not achieved within 50 days. Despite expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin, Trump affirmed his dedication to ending the conflict, even as Russia's Kremlin views his recent actions as an encouragement to continue the war.</p>
