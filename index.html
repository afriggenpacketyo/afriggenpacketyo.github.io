        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's core inflation rate eased to 0.3% in August, its lowest since February 2021, falling below economists' expectations of 0.5% due to reduced services costs. Headline inflation also dropped to 0.5%, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) attributing the decline to cheaper holiday expenses, airfares, and inpatient services. The MAS maintains its full-year inflation forecast for 2025 between 0.5% and 1.5%, anticipating that global trade conflicts' inflationary impact on some economies will be offset by weaker global demand's disinflationary drags. This easing occurs as the city-state prepares for slower growth in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order designating the left-wing Antifa movement as a "domestic terrorist organization," citing a pattern of political violence aimed at suppressing lawful activity and obstructing the rule of law. The announcement followed the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Trump attributed to left-wing rhetoric, despite investigators not linking the suspect to any groups. The order directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle the movement, potentially expanding surveillance powers. Critics warn this move could curb free speech and target dissent, as there is no legal precedent for such a domestic designation.</p>

Perdue's comments follow President Trump's social media post about a potential meeting next month and a visit to China early next year, details which were absent from the Chinese readout. The U.S. delegation, including lawmakers, discussed the potential meeting and other issues like TikTok ownership during their rare visit to Beijing. Ambassador Perdue indicated a positive and encouraging relationship currently exists between the two leaders.</p>

The Philadelphia Eagles staged a massive comeback against the Los Angeles Rams, remaining unbeaten after blocking a last-gasp field goal and returning it for a touchdown. The Cleveland Browns secured an upset win against the Green Bay Packers with a dramatic 55-yard kick, ending an eight-game losing streak. Notable performances included Mac Jones leading the San Francisco 49ers to a 3-0 start and Daniel 'Indiana' Jones's historic form for the Indianapolis Colts.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen and Oslo's main airports were forced to close temporarily on Monday night following unidentified drone sightings, impacting approximately 20,000 passengers. Danish police reported two to three large drones around Copenhagen Airport, suggesting a "capable operator" but no intent to cause harm, though armed forces were activated.

          <p>A paediatrician, Mike Freelander, reassures Australians that paracetamol remains a safe medication for use during pregnancy, directly refuting recent comments by US President Donald Trump linking it to autism. Freelander emphasizes that extensive studies have found no evidence of causation, with the largest and most recent Swedish and Japanese studies disproving a causative effect. He stresses the importance of trusting regulatory frameworks like Australia's TGA, which classify paracetamol as safe, and warns against unscientific health policies that can cause significant anxiety and inappropriate health outcomes. This article advocates for reliance on expert scientific evidence in healthcare decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed an industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized websites use bots and fake identities to resell tickets at inflated prices, often leaving fans out of pocket. The problem was highlighted during a Brighton vs. Tottenham match, where over a hundred fans, including a supporter who traveled 5,500 miles, were turned away due to illegitimate tickets. Brighton is actively combating this issue with new technology and a dedicated investigation officer, preventing an estimated £100,000 in transactions to touts for one match alone. The Premier League is also introducing encrypted digital ticketing to make touting more difficult.</p>

          <p>Sam Allardyce, once criticized for his direct football style, observes a modern resurgence of his playbook in the Premier League, with teams increasingly emphasizing set-pieces and long passes. The article highlights how coaches are now adopting tactics like goalkeepers hitting long balls and utilizing big strikers for flick-ons, mirroring Allardyce's successful methods from over two decades ago. Allardyce notes that modern coaches, including Paris St-Germain's Luis Enrique, are even adopting his preference for watching games from the stands for a better overview. This shift reflects a move away from the 'pandemic' of playing out from the back, as teams prioritize sensible use of skills and set-piece efficiency.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have booked at least 10 cargoes of soybeans from Argentina, leveraging low prices due to Argentina's temporary removal of export taxes, amidst ongoing Sino-U.S. trade tensions. This move allows China to build inventories for the fourth quarter, bypassing U.S. supplies, as U.S. farmers miss out on significant sales. The deals followed Argentina's policy to suspend grain export taxes through October, or until declared exports reach $7 billion, which subsequently drove down Chinese soymeal futures. Experts suggest the impact of this policy on prices may be short-lived due to Argentina's limited overall supply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old Washington, D.C. man, Jacob Samuel Winkler, has been arrested and federally charged for allegedly shining a laser pointer at Marine One while President Trump was aboard. A U.S. Secret Service officer spotted Winkler aiming the red laser beam at the presidential helicopter, an act that could temporarily blind or disorient a pilot and risk an airborne collision. Winkler reportedly told investigators he points lasers at various objects and was unaware of the prohibition against aiming at Marine One. The U.S. Attorney for D.C. emphasized that such behavior endangers everyone on board and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced that doctors in the US would soon be advised against prescribing Tylenol to pregnant women, citing a disputed link between the drug's main ingredient, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and autism. Trump claimed it's "no good" and should only be used for extreme fever, despite Tylenol maker Kenvue defending its safety and medical experts warning against the advice. The FDA is reportedly initiating a safety label change and public health campaign, while also approving Leucovorin as an autism treatment, based on early-stage research into folate deficiency. This article highlights the controversy and pushback from the medical community regarding the unproven claims.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller's eulogy for Charlie Kirk served as a stark battle cry for the Trump administration's perceived war on its foes, emphasizing a Manichean worldview where Trump's side embodies pure good against pure evil. The article highlights Miller's rhetoric, depicting opponents as "wickedness, jealousy, envy, hatred" who can create "nothing," a stark contrast to his own criticisms of others. This speech, delivered after Kirk's assassination, is analyzed as an attempt to exceed Trump's divisive style by depicting opponents as malevolent and incapable. The piece contrasts Miller's approach with calls for reconciliation seen in past national tragedies.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne has commended the "remarkable" journalists who uncovered the phone hacking scandal, ahead of ITV's new drama 'The Hack,' which stars David Tennant. Thorne, known for 'Adolescence,' stated that the story reveals a troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police, going beyond mere journalistic misconduct. He highlighted the courage of these journalists in holding their own industry accountable, contrasting it with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal where public awareness was slower to build despite earlier journalistic efforts. The series will tell the story from the perspectives of an investigative reporter and a police detective.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions of its advanced H20 line, which were offered as a compromise to maintain US technological lead while allowing some sales. Beijing views purchasing these less powerful chips as accepting "US-dictated tech inferiority" and is instead prioritizing full technological independence. This decision marks a turning point in global technology politics, as China shifts from tolerating reliance on US supply chains to making self-sufficiency a national necessity. Regulators have reportedly ordered tech companies to halt purchases and opened antitrust investigations into Nvidia.</p>
