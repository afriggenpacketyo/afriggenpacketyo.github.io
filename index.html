          <h2>Senate Bill Removes Proposed Excise Tax on Renewable Energy Projects</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:17:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill has removed a controversial excise tax that would have targeted the renewable energy industry. The tax would have applied to wind and solar projects using materials from prohibited countries like China, potentially increasing energy costs for consumers. While its removal is a relief for the industry, the bill still accelerates the phase-out of key clean energy tax credits, a move that environmental groups argue will hinder the transition to cheaper, cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that President Trump's tariffs are a key reason the central bank has not yet cut interest rates this year. Speaking at a conference, Powell stated that the imposition of steep tariffs on trading partners caused inflation forecasts to rise materially, prompting the Fed to adopt a 'wait and see' approach. He emphasized the need for the central bank to remain nonpolitical while monitoring the economic effects of the tariffs before making any moves on interest rates.</p>

          <p>The Senate-approved version of President Trump's spending package contains numerous provisions that could significantly affect household finances across the United States. Key measures include raising the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap, increasing the child tax credit, and introducing a new 'bonus' deduction for seniors. The bill also proposes substantial cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits, overhauls federal student loan programs, and eliminates various tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles, signaling major shifts in federal fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Sweeping changes proposed in President Trump's 'big beautiful bill' could result in millions of Americans losing health insurance, with a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. The legislation would cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, largely by implementing strict new work requirements and capping state provider taxes. Health policy experts warn these changes could lead to 11.8 million people becoming uninsured by 2034 and threaten the financial stability of rural hospitals that heavily rely on Medicaid funding for their operations.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a strict new anti-smoking law that bans smoking in most public spaces, including beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries. The move aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, and reduce the 75,000 tobacco-related deaths that occur in the country each year. Violators of the new ban could face fines of up to 700 euros, though one of the last remaining refuges for smokers will be the outdoor terraces of cafÃ©s and restaurants.</p>

          <p>The TSB brand name could disappear from the UK as its Spanish owner, Sabadell, has agreed to sell the bank to rival Santander for Â£2.65 billion. If the deal is approved by shareholders, Santander intends to fully integrate TSB into its UK operations, which would create the nation's third-largest bank by personal current accounts. While the companies state it is business as usual for now, Santander has not ruled out future branch closures or job cuts, particularly in duplicated back-office roles.</p>

          <p>Shares of defense contractor AeroVironment fell by 11% after the company announced plans for a public offering of common stock and convertible senior notes. The drone maker intends to raise a combined $1.35 billion, primarily to repay debt incurred from its recent acquisition of space technology company Blue Halo. The stock offering comes after a period of rapid growth for the company's shares, which have risen 85% this year amid strong earnings and increased interest in the defense technology sector.
