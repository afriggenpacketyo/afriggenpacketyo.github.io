          <p>Following devastating floods in early July, officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of unaccounted-for individuals from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies who verified that most people initially reported as missing were safe. The update brings a measure of relief to a community that saw over 100 fatalities from the flooding, which affected the entire state.</p>

          <p>Players at the WNBA All-Star Game made a collective statement by wearing warmup shirts that read “Pay us what you owe us,” highlighting their ongoing labor dispute with the league. The protest follows stalled negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, as players seek an improved revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and better benefits. With the current CBA set to expire, prominent players have indicated a potential walkout if a new agreement is not reached by October.</p>

          <p>The animated sitcom "Family Guy" has targeted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for a second time in a recent episode, two years after its initial jab at the couple. The new joke compares their marriage to historical disasters, prompting a cutaway gag where an animated Prince Harry reacts with annoyance. This follows a 2023 episode that satirized their multi-million dollar deals and departure from royal duties, continuing a trend of animated shows parodying the couple's public life.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to "close the gap" in prosecuting individuals who plan mass attacks without a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation, prompted by last year's Southport attack, would allow police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This measure aims to address the growing threat from lone, violence-obsessed individuals who may not fit the legal definition of a terrorist.</p>

Mexican airlines will now require U.S. government approval for their flight schedules, escalating a trade dispute between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>
