          <p>Sanshiro Murao clinched his first judo world championship title in the men's 90-kilogram division, defeating compatriot Goki Tajima in the final after a series of ippon wins. Shiho Tanaka also secured her maiden world title in the women's 70-kg final, overcoming top-ranked Lara Cvjetko of Croatia. Tanaka's victory was especially poignant, as she had recovered from a severe knee injury sustained in 2022 that threatened her career. These wins contribute to Japan's total of six gold medals at the ongoing world championships, marking their best performance since 2018. The article reflects the athletes' dedication and perseverance on the world stage, showcasing Japan's continued dominance in judo. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-over-year decline in May, marking the sharpest drop in eight months, primarily due to falling shipments to the U.S. and China. The decline in exports to the U.S. was particularly notable, with motor vehicle exports plummeting by 24.7%. The Bank of Japan has indicated that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade factors, leading to concerns about overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. Experts suggest that tariffs are the main threat to Japan's economic outlook, potentially impacting GDP growth despite efforts to diversify trade through agreements like the CPTPP and RCEP.

          <p>The Defense Department has announced the continued deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area, operating under Title 10 authority. These troops are intended to support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property amid ongoing immigration enforcement activities and related protests.

          <p>A U.S. judge appointed by Biden has issued a ruling to temporarily block the Trump administration's policy of only allowing male or female gender designations on U.S. passports. The ruling extends a previous decision that blocked the policy for six individuals, now applying it to all Americans. The judge stated that the policy discriminates on the basis of sex and is rooted in prejudice towards transgender Americans, causing psychological distress and safety concerns for those whose passports do not align with their gender identity. Trump's executive order, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," directed agencies to recognize only two sexes.</p>

European leaders are seeking an understanding with the U.S. to ensure continued support until Europe can take greater responsibility for its own security, including air and missile defenses. Ultimately, European leaders must recognize the shifting U.S. security focus towards China and work to build a stronger European pillar within NATO, preparing for a future where they may need to act independently.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering whether to pursue a diplomatic solution with Iran or resort to military action, with U.S. officials signaling that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical. Despite heightened rhetoric, U.S. negotiators believe Iran's weak position could force it back to the negotiating table to abandon nuclear enrichment. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, maintaining a defensive posture while keeping options open to assist Israel. A key decision involves potentially deploying B-2 stealth bombers to target Iran's underground nuclear facility at Fordo.</p>

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan to enhance the renminbi's global reach, according to People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. The initiative is part of a broader effort to expand overseas adoption of the yuan and promote Shanghai as a global financial hub, amid trade tensions with the United States. China has developed a multi-channel cross-border renminbi clearing network and will pilot structural monetary policy tools in Shanghai.
