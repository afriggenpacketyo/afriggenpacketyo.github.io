          <h2>Psychology Expert Outlines Five Principles for Achieving Happiness Without Great Wealth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 11:51:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing from his book, "The Art of Spending Money," author Morgan Housel outlines five psychological rules for finding happiness that do not depend on high income. He argues that true contentment comes from appreciating the ordinary, managing expectations, and desiring less, rather than constantly pursuing more wealth. Housel illustrates this by contrasting the contentment of his low-income grandmother-in-law with the dissatisfaction of billionaires he has met. The central idea is that happiness is found when nothing feels missing, regardless of one's material lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A prominent drag queen in Arizona, Michael Browder, has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a 13-year-old boy he met on a dating app. According to court documents, Browder, known as Aubrey Ghalichi, admitted to the act but told investigators he believed the minor was 18 or 19 years old. The boy had reportedly posed as an adult online to arrange meetings. In response to the charges, Phoenix Pride has removed Browder from its upcoming festival lineup, calling the alleged crime reprehensible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has announced a plan to double tariffs on foreign steel to 50% and significantly reduce import quotas to protect its struggling domestic industry. This move is a direct response to the flood of cheaper steel from China and aligns the EU's trade policy with similar measures taken by the U.S. under President Trump. The proposal aims to help the European steel sector, which employs around 300,000 people, become more competitive and invest in decarbonization. The plan requires approval from EU member states and the European Parliament.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned the Trump administration's decision to send Texas National Guard members to Chicago, labeling it an "authoritarian march." In response, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block the federalization and deployment of the troops. Pritzker accused the administration of using service members as political props to create fear and a pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act. The move comes amid heightened tensions over federal immigration enforcement actions in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case concerning Colorado's 2019 law that bans "conversion therapy" for minors. A Christian counselor, Kaley Chiles, is challenging the ban, arguing it violates her free speech rights by censoring conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity with her young patients. Colorado defends the law as a regulation of professional conduct designed to protect minors from harmful and ineffective practices.

          <p>Tesla has released a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised technology, but the announcement has been overshadowed by investor anticipation for a more significant reveal. The company teased a major announcement with cryptic social media clips, leading to speculation about a new, lower-cost Model Y or an update on the long-promised next-generation Roadster. This comes as Tesla, facing a multi-quarter sales slump and increased competition, attempts to refocus investor attention on its future as a robotics and autonomous driving company. The anticipation caused Tesla shares to climb 5%.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the typical pre-holiday boom, the logistics sector showed signs of a potential freight recession in September, according to the latest Logistics Managers' Index. The index recorded its lowest-ever reading for transportation utilization for the month, indicating that the usual surge in shipments of holiday merchandise is not occurring. Experts suggest that many companies front-loaded their inventory earlier in the year, which is now accumulating in warehouses and driving up storage costs. This stagnation in freight movement for a second consecutive month raises concerns about a broader economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Paddington Bear Creators Sue 'Spitting Image' Over Satirical Portrayal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The estate of Michael Bond and the producers of the Paddington films are suing Avalon, the company behind the satirical show "Spitting Image." The lawsuit, filed in the High Court, cites copyright concerns over the show's depiction of the beloved children's character. In a YouTube series, "Spitting Image" portrayed Paddington Bear as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears, advertises guns, and admits to drug use. This crude parody is a stark departure from the gentle, well-mannered bear known to generations of fans, prompting the legal action to protect the character's integrity.</p>

          <h2>Germany Debates Responsibility for Drone Defense After Airport Disruptions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent flight suspensions at Munich Airport caused by drone sightings, a political debate has erupted in Germany over who is responsible for drone defense. The discussion centers on whether the federal government or the individual German states should have primary authority to protect critical infrastructure. Currently, state police handle most drone threats, but they lack the military-grade equipment to shoot them down, and constitutional law restricts the German military from operating domestically. This has exposed a potential security gap that officials are now seeking to address.</p>

          <p>At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi refused to answer questions about who instructed FBI agents to flag documents mentioning President Donald Trump during a review of Jeffrey Epstein's files.

Bondi stated she was "not going to discuss anything about that," prompting Durbin to reply that she would eventually have to answer for her conduct.

          <p>The price of gold futures has surged past the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time in history, reflecting widespread investor anxiety. The record high is being driven by a flight to safe-haven assets amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and broader global economic uncertainty. Gold, which tends to perform well in times of instability and low interest rates, has climbed 52% so far this year.

The article notes that the market capitalization-weighted nature of the S&P 500 gives it a heavy concentration in a few large technology companies, which can increase portfolio risk. To mitigate this, advisors suggest alternatives like total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. This approach aims to create a more balanced portfolio in case of a market pullback. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New data reveals a clear trend of startups staying private for longer before going public, with the median age for an IPO now at 13 years, up from 10 in 2018. This shift is largely attributed to the massive growth in alternative capital from private equity, venture capital, and sovereign wealth funds. This abundance of private funding allows companies to mature and raise substantial capital without the regulatory burdens and short-term pressures of being publicly traded. As a result, companies are much larger and have higher revenues by the time they eventually enter the public markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unusual number of ladybirds have been reported swarming in and around UK homes, a phenomenon experts say is normal for this time of year. The recent spell of warm, sunny weather has prompted the insects to become active and seek out sheltered spots to enter diapause, a form of winter hibernation. Many of these ladybirds are the invasive harlequin species, which often prefers to shelter inside buildings. The surge in their population is also linked to the warm spring and summer, which led to a boom in aphids, their primary food source.</p>
