          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor Technologies have seen a dramatic surge, fueled by renewed interest from retail traders on social media platforms like Reddit's WallStreetBets. The stock, which traded as a penny stock for much of the year, experienced a more than threefold price increase in just days, accompanied by massive trading volumes. This rally is attributed to its status as a heavily shorted stock, drawing comparisons to the 2021 GameStop mania and intensifying due to significant options trading activity. The volatility highlights the ongoing influence of retail investors on specific, targeted stocks in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel recently shared an update on his health after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a condition involving fluid buildup in the brain. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old singer described one of the primary symptoms as poor balance, comparing the sensation to "being on a boat." While he noted the condition is still being treated and is not yet fixed, he reassured fans that he feels good and that the "brain disorder" sounds more severe than his current experience. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a treatable condition that typically affects older adults, though its cause is often unknown.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of Gaza City's Al-Shifa hospital reported that 21 children have died from malnutrition and starvation across the territory in the last three days, highlighting a deepening humanitarian crisis. United Nations officials and human rights groups have warned that lifelines are collapsing, with many Gazans, particularly children, showing severe symptoms of malnutrition. The situation has been exacerbated by Israel's near-total blockade on aid, which, despite some recent allowances, remains vastly insufficient to meet the needs of over two million people. The crisis continues amid the ongoing war sparked by the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people who allege they were victims of abuse by the late Mohamed Al Fayed have applied to a compensation scheme established by the Harrods department store. The scheme, which opened in March and will accept applications until 2026, was created after numerous women accused the former Harrods owner of sexual assault. Harrods has also initiated High Court action to replace the executors of Fayed's estate to ensure its assets are protected for potential claimants. The store previously apologized for failing to protect victims, stating it was "utterly appalled" by the allegations that emerged from a BBC investigation.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has confirmed that a five-day strike by resident doctors in England will proceed as planned after negotiations with the government failed to produce a breakthrough. Despite constructive talks on non-pay issues like working conditions and student loan forgiveness, the BMA stated that the core issue of pay restoration remains unresolved. The union argues that real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008 and the government's offers have not adequately addressed this decline. The strike is expected to cause significant disruption to the National Health Service, with concerns raised about patient safety and routine treatments.</p>

          <p>According to former Glacier National Park superintendent Jeff Mow, severe budget and staffing cuts under the Trump administration are "hollowing out" the U.S. National Park Service. While visitor services like clean toilets may appear normal, crucial behind-the-scenes functions are being decimated. Mow explains that the cuts disproportionately harm smaller parks and eliminate vital expertise needed for resource preservation and environmental monitoring. This neglect of long-term conservation, such as tracking invasive species or endangered wildlife, jeopardizes the very purpose for which these parks were established, potentially causing irreversible damage to America's natural and historical treasures.</p>

Using remotely operated vehicles, the Ocean Exploration Trust captured high-resolution footage showing that the ship's torpedoes and bell remain largely intact on the seabed. The DeHaven sank after being bombed by Japanese aircraft, resulting in the loss of 167 crew members. This survey of the wreckage in the historic Iron Bottom Sound provides valuable data for historians and maritime heritage managers, shedding more light on the pivotal naval battles of the Guadalcanal campaign.</p>

The rally appears driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who have targeted Kohl's due to its high short interest, where about half of its available shares are sold short. This phenomenon, known as a short squeeze, occurs when rising prices force short sellers to buy back shares, further fueling the stock's ascent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a significant increase of £6.6 billion compared to the same month last year and higher than economists' expectations. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise to increased spending on public services and soaring debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to high inflation. This figure represents the second-highest June borrowing on record, adding substantial pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Analysts suggest that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary in the upcoming Autumn Budget to align with fiscal targets amid a challenging economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

Palace argues that Textor does not hold decisive influence over the club and is seeking to be readmitted to the competition.

This article argues that Trump's stance on monetary policy is predictably partisan: he advocates for low interest rates under Republican presidents to boost the economy and high rates under Democrats to slow it down. This pattern, evident since the Obama administration, suggests he views the Fed not as an independent institution balancing inflation and unemployment, but as a political tool to be wielded for electoral advantage. His hostility reflects a belief that the Fed's independence is a facade for its own political agenda.</p>

          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the estate of the late tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his former business partner, Sushovan Hussain, owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's software company, Autonomy, for $11.1 billion. HPE successfully argued that Lynch and Hussain fraudulently inflated Autonomy's value by misrepresenting its finances, causing HPE to overpay significantly. A year after the purchase, HPE wrote down Autonomy's value by $8.8 billion. This judgment concludes a long and contentious legal battle, though the final amount of damages is still to be determined.</p>

          <p>A passenger aboard a SkyWest flight described the moment the aircraft made a sudden, sharp turn to avoid a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota, as feeling like a "sharp turn on a roller coaster." The commercial flight, with 80 people on board, was on approach when the bomber, part of a planned flyover for the state fair, appeared unexpectedly. The pilot later informed passengers that air traffic control had not advised them of the military aircraft's presence, forcing him to take evasive action. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the near-miss to determine how close the two planes came to each other.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have placed exit bans on two U.S. citizens: a U.S. Department of Commerce employee and a Wells Fargo banker, preventing them from leaving China. The State Department confirmed it is closely tracking the case of the government employee, who was traveling in a personal capacity and has been restricted since mid-April. Separately, China's Foreign Ministry confirmed that Wells Fargo managing director Mao Chenyue is involved in a criminal investigation and cannot leave the country. These incidents highlight the risks for Americans in China, as the State Department warns that Beijing can arbitrarily enforce such bans without a transparent legal process.</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, a senior Justice Department official and former lawyer for Donald Trump, is facing opposition for his nomination to a federal appeals court, including from prominent conservative legal figures. Critics argue that Bove's nomination prioritizes personal loyalty to the president over principled conservative ideology, a departure from the movement's decades-long project to appoint ideologically committed judges. Opponents point to Bove's controversial actions, such as ordering the dismissal of charges against a political figure and allegations of abusive behavior, as evidence that he lacks the character and integrity for a lifetime judicial appointment. His confirmation is seen by some as a return to cronyism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The common advice to "just be yourself" is often counterproductive and incomplete, according to psychotherapist Britt Frank. In this article, she argues that humans have multiple, often conflicting, "selves" and that our behavior is heavily influenced by our nervous system's state, not a single authentic identity. Using authenticity as a justification for poor behavior can also damage relationships. Instead of striving for a raw, unfiltered self, Frank advocates for "self-leadership," which involves consciously choosing which parts of oneself to present in different situations. This approach promotes self-awareness, alignment with personal values, and taking responsibility for one's impact on others.</p>

The White House stated the organization "supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes" and that the move aligns with an "America First" policy. This decision reverses the Biden administration's action to rejoin the agency just two years ago, which itself followed a withdrawal during Trump's first term over an alleged anti-Israel bias. The move reflects the administration's broader skepticism of international organizations and its efforts to roll back support for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p>

While travel continues, businesses are being more strategic, prioritizing essential relationship-building meetings over large group events.

The author contends that the court's conservative supermajority, by lifting a lower court's injunction without providing a rationale, is undermining the separation of powers and enabling the president to gut a congressionally-created agency. The dissent, written by Justice Sotomayor, warned that the judiciary's duty is to check lawlessness, not expedite it.
