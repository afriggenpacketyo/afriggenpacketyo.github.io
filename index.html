          <p>The Walt Disney Company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst predictions, largely due to robust performance in its streaming services and theme parks division. The streaming unit, anchored by Disney+, showed significant growth, helping to offset the continued decline in the traditional television business. While revenue from experiences like theme parks and cruises increased, the theatrical division faced challenges with underperforming films compared to the previous year's successes. The company raised its future earnings guidance, signaling confidence in its strategic direction. (not investment advice)</p>

The blaze, described as the largest in the country this year, has consumed over 13,000 hectares and destroyed numerous homes, leaving thousands without power. Driven by strong winds and hot, dry conditions, officials warn the fire is advancing rapidly and will take several days to control, highlighting the region's increasing vulnerability to such disasters.

This strategy also responds to President Trump's ultimatum for drug makers to reduce prices to international levels.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow for diplomatic talks concerning the war in Ukraine. The meeting comes just days before a White House deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal or face the possibility of severe economic penalties, including tariffs on countries purchasing its oil. President Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas despite ongoing negotiations. The discussions are seen as a critical, last-ditch effort to find a diplomatic resolution and de-escalate the three-year-long conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite recent news of cost-cutting measures, Manchester United is positioned to fund a major £74 million transfer for striker Benjamin Sesko through clever financial strategies. The club has structured payments for its summer signings favorably, spreading costs over the duration of player contracts. Additional funds have been generated by loaning out high-wage players like Marcus Rashford, receiving a fee from Chelsea for a canceled deal, and collecting on sell-on clauses from former players. While the club is not without financial pressures, its powerful commercial brand and strategic asset management enable significant investment in its squad. (not investment advice)</p>

O'Rourke has been actively fundraising and has assured the caucus of his support during their protest. This financial backing is crucial as the lawmakers face threats of arrest and fines for their absence from the state legislature.</p>

          <p>The federal Energy Star program, a public-private partnership administered by the EPA, is reportedly facing elimination under proposed Trump administration budget cuts, creating significant concern within the commercial real estate industry. Beyond its well-known appliance efficiency labels, the program provides the essential software platform, Portfolio Manager, used by hundreds of thousands of buildings to track energy use. This tool is fundamental for landlords to comply with state and local climate policies, access tax breaks, and manage portfolio-wide energy performance. The potential loss of this data infrastructure could disrupt compliance, hinder retrofitting initiatives, and increase costs if a private, fee-based system were to replace it.</p>

The new episodes appear to be edited to minimize the hosts' usual banter and focus more on the cooking challenges and judging.

He argues that while Democrats embraced policies that favored corporations and the wealthy, Republicans exploited the resulting anger by directing it at scapegoats.

The meeting follows a five-day walkout in July, the 12th such action since March 2023. While Health Secretary Wes Streeting has stated he will not negotiate further on pay, talks are expected to cover non-pay issues like career progression, working conditions, and out-of-pocket expenses for doctors in training.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Reassures Public on Chip Security, Denying Existence of Backdoors or Kill Switches</h2>

          <p>In a recent blog post, Nvidia's chief security officer, David Reber Jr., explicitly denied that the company's chips contain any hidden backdoors, kill switches, or spyware. The statement aims to reinforce the security and trustworthiness of its products amid heightened global scrutiny of technology supply chains. Reber emphasized that embedding such vulnerabilities would be a gift to malicious actors and that established law requires companies to fix security flaws, not create them. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical components in a wide range of industries, including AI infrastructure, healthcare, and autonomous systems, making their security a paramount concern.</p>

          <p>Stanley Burkhardt, a 74-year-old former New Orleans detective with a history of convictions for child sexual abuse crimes, has been jailed again on new allegations. The recent charges stem from his alleged illegal use of social media in 2019 to post suggestive comments on photos of young men, violating the conditions of his previous release from a federal treatment facility for sexually dangerous individuals. Burkhardt, who has also been investigated in connection with unsolved murders, was working at a local market before his latest arrest. His case has been reinitiated, and he is currently being held without bond pending further court proceedings.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. marks the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the landmark legislation faces significant threats that could further erode its protections against racial discrimination at the ballot box. A 2013 Supreme Court decision already weakened the law by ending the requirement for jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to get federal pre-clearance for election changes. Now, new legal challenges are progressing toward the Supreme Court that could limit the ability of private groups to sue under the act and question the constitutionality of creating majority-minority districts. These developments are unfolding amid ongoing political battles over redistricting and voting access across the country.</p>

          <p>An annual FBI report reveals that violent crime in the United States fell to levels not seen since the 1960s during 2024, directly contradicting the narrative of an out-of-control crime wave promoted by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. The data shows a 4.5% decrease in all violent crime, with murders dropping by 14.5% nationally. The decline was even more pronounced in large cities, where murders fell by over 19%. While the report comes with the caveat that it is based on voluntarily submitted data, analysts suggest the trend is clear and indicates a significant nationwide improvement in public safety.</p>

          <p>In a notable ideological critique from within the far-right, the pseudonymous influencer 'Bronze Age Pervert' (BAP) has attacked the economic nationalism driving President Trump's tariff policies. BAP argues that attempting to revive 1950s-style manufacturing jobs is a futile and backward-looking strategy that cedes the future to China. He claims this vision, promoted by figures like VP J.D. Vance, is a betrayal of what he sees as true Trumpism, which should instead focus on unleashing economic dynamism by slashing domestic regulations. This essay highlights a philosophical schism on the American right between communitarian nationalists and a more Nietzschean faction focused on raw power and dominance.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a poster advertisement for BrewDog's Wingman beer, ruling that it improperly implied alcohol could solve problems like boredom, loneliness, and frustration. The ad depicted scenarios such as Wi-Fi failure and a friend's delay, positioning the beer as a reliable companion that "always got your back." Although BrewDog argued the ad was meant to highlight the beer's reliable quality, the ASA concluded it suggested alcohol was a solution to negative emotional states. This is the latest in a series of rulings against the craft beer company for its advertising campaigns.</p>

The investigation began after five missing individuals were last seen near the same location, with security footage linking two of them to the suspect. A raid on the man's home in Jujuy province uncovered bones, blood, and other human remains. The suspect's teenage nephew, found at the scene, told police his uncle would lure victims to the house on Fridays with offers of work or a drink before killing them.

          <p>Despite being economically and politically unpopular, President Donald Trump's tariffs could remain in place long after his presidency due to the significant revenue they generate for the U.S. government. The tariffs are projected to yield trillions over the next decade, effectively acting as a major tax hike enacted without congressional approval. With rising deficits and a political aversion to other forms of taxation, future presidents may be reluctant to repeal them and deepen the fiscal hole. This dynamic, combined with lobbying from protected industries, could make the protectionist regime politically resilient, even if it harms overall economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

In his inaugural address, Nawrocki emphasized Polish sovereignty within the EU and pledged to build the largest NATO force in the union.
