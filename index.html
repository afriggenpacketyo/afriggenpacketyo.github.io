          <p>The UK government announced a new funding package for community pharmacies in England, increasing funding to Â£3.1 billion next year. This deal, which includes debt write-offs and expanded services, led some pharmacies to postpone planned protests over unsustainable pressures. While welcomed as a step in the right direction, concerns remain that the funding increase may not fully cover rising costs, suggesting a potential bias towards portraying the government's actions in a positive light.</p>
