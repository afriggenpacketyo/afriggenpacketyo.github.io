          <p>Kemi Badenoch stated that changing the Conservative leader alone won't solve the party's problems after significant losses in local elections, cautioning against a knee-jerk reaction and emphasizing the need for a credible plan to regain government by the decade's end. She acknowledged Reform UK's success and the public's frustration, asserting that the Conservatives are focused on fixing the country rather than merely winning votes. Badenoch dismissed the feasibility of Nigel Farage becoming prime minister, while Labour's Wes Streeting acknowledged Reform UK as a serious opposition force. The article also noted the Conservatives lost a substantial number of council seats to Reform and the Liberal Democrats, signaling a major shift in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Heather Stewart reports on the economic uncertainty in the U.S. due to President Trump's policies, noting that businesses and consumers are wary amid the chaos emanating from the White House. While hard economic data is currently holding up, forward-looking surveys reveal anxiety, particularly regarding tariffs and budget cuts. The article highlights concerns about potential worker shortages due to immigration policies and the overall unknowability of future economic policy, with business owners expressing that clarity on tariffs would allow them to adapt. The article suggests that market pressures might eventually force a more settled policy position, but Trump's love of political drama makes future policy unpredictable.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is considering legal challenges to prevent migrants from being housed in asylum hotels in areas under its control, according to party chairman Zia Yusuf. He stated that the party plans to "resist" housing asylum seekers and will use judicial reviews and other measures to fulfill this pledge, despite the Home Office's responsibility for asylum seeker housing. Yusuf mentioned exploring legal options related to planning and budget allocation, suggesting that hotels converted into hostels may violate regulations. The party also intends to publish a plan to deport all illegal immigrants during its first term. Yusuf criticized spending on diversity and inclusion initiatives, while other political figures commented on Reform's success and potential impact.</p>

Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed the airport was "no longer safe for air travel," while Israeli authorities confirmed the missile's impact and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to discuss a response. The Israeli Air Force is investigating the failure to intercept the missile, which landed beside a road near a Terminal three parking lot. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have frequently launched missile attacks on Israel in solidarity with Hamas, and have been attacking ships in the Red Sea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president was a pivotal moment, signaling a shift from a coalition government to a royal court. Unlike potential picks like Marco Rubio and Doug Burgum, Vance was a staunch member of the MAGA movement, prioritizing loyalty and enforcement over moderation. Klein contends that Trump's first term involved tension between his disinhibition and advisors who acted as inhibitors, whereas his second term is characterized by loyalists who will do as they are told. This shift, Klein argues, means Trump's second term will be more ferocious and reckless by design, with guardrails removed and no concessions made.</p>

The conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was even nicknamed “Temu Trump” for espousing similar ideas, which ultimately hurt his campaign.

          <p>Native American women are reclaiming the tradition of facial tattoos, known as inchunwa, as a symbol of cultural revitalization and commitment to their communities. The Inchunwa Project, a community-rooted collective, is working to revive the practice among south-eastern Indigenous nations. Lisa Fruichantie, the executive director of the Inchunwa Project, said that receiving and promoting inchunwa is a way for south-eastern Indigenous people to continue a millennia-old tradition. Receiving inchunwa reflects a commitment to community and setting the groundwork for being a good ancestor.</p>

          <p>Thousands of victims of sexual assault in Los Angeles juvenile facilities and foster homes are being compensated in a historic $4bn settlement, though some argue the money can't rectify the system's harm to vulnerable children. The claims, dating back to the 1950s, center on facilities like the MacLaren children’s center, where victims reported abuse and threats. While officials say a few cases have been referred to the district attorney, no arrests have been made. A mental health case manager who was incarcerated as an adolescent described abuse and mistreatment by staff, stating the settlement doesn't bring relief.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to maintain steady interest rates, despite pressure from President Trump for a cut, as officials prioritize controlling inflation. Recent data showing a healthy jump in April payrolls supports the Fed's position, while a favored inflation gauge indicates easing price pressures. Uncertainty remains due to potential tariff changes, making economic forecasting challenging. Economists anticipate Powell will prioritize price stability amid concerns about loosening inflation expectations, noting limited pressure for a near-term rate cut.</p>

          <p>NYU professor Scott Galloway suggests that a significant portion of Social Security recipients, possibly up to a third of senior citizens, should not receive benefits because they don't need them. Galloway argues this could address economic inequality and reduce costs in a program facing insolvency. He describes American seniors as the wealthiest generation and questions the transfer of wealth from younger generations to them. He argues that young people are struggling with debt, cost of living and stagnant wages, and payroll taxes makes up most of the program's revenue.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party is presenting a serious challenge to the governing Labour Party and the opposition Conservatives, according to a News Analysis article in the New York Times. Reform UK's gains in local elections have consolidated Farage's reputation as a political disrupter and may have blown a hole in the country’s two-party political system. Claire Ainsley, a former policy director for Keir Starmer, said the results also reflected longer-term trends, including a breakdown of traditional class loyalties among voters, the increasing pull of nationalist politics and growing support for smaller parties.</p>

          <p>Across Africa, local traders are increasingly using China’s yuan instead of the US dollar for international transactions, especially in bustling commercial hubs like Nairobi’s Eastleigh market and Lagos’ Alaba district. Logistics companies are playing a crucial role by offering Kenyan Shilling-yuan conversion services, enabling traders to pay in local currency while handling yuan payments to Chinese sellers. This shift is creating informal yuan payment networks to facilitate business with China, the world’s second-largest economy. These companies also streamline the sourcing and delivery of goods from Chinese hubs like Guangzhou and Yiwu, making the process more efficient for African traders.</p>
