          <p>Israel launched a major operation, "Operation Rising Lion," targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, military commanders, and scientists in response to an alleged Iranian plan to destroy Israel. Iran retaliated by launching over 100 drones at Israel, prompting interception efforts by Israeli air defenses, and potential interceptions in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, reported that Iran's Fordo nuclear site was not impacted by the strikes and no increase in radiation levels were observed at the Natanz site. The exchange of fire disrupted international air travel in the region, and the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place as tensions escalated between the two nations.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway to determine who is funding anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots disrupting Los Angeles and other major U.S. cities. Crowds on Demand, a company specializing in providing crowds for protests, reported receiving "numerous high budget requests" to participate in the anti-ICE riots but declined due to concerns about illegal activity. Senator Josh Hawley and Representative Kevin Kiley are questioning organizations like the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) regarding their involvement. CHIRLA, which has received $34 million in government grants, is suspected of providing logistical and financial support to rioters, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the violence and looting, emphasizing that those actions do not support immigrants.</p>

Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi advocate for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security architecture, maritime legal order, law enforcement norms, and crisis response protocols.

Unique flavors include Nordic countries' "coffee cheese" and Vietnam's egg coffee, while Indonesia's "kopi luwak" remains ethically controversial. Cafes have historically served as incubators of ideas and revolution, from 16th-century Istanbul to Enlightenment-era Europe, and continue to evolve as refuges for modern life, with the emergence of cat cafes and spaces offering public internet access.</p>

Key facilities include Natanz, the main center for uranium enrichment; Isfahan, a uranium processing plant; Saghand, a uranium mine; Bushehr, a civilian nuclear power plant; and Fordow, a fuel enrichment plant located inside a mountain near Qom. The IAEA has confirmed that the Natanz facility was among the targets in recent Israeli strikes, but said no radiation leaks have been detected.</p>

Changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act give the immigration minister extensive powers to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake in any immigration stream.

          <p>With one year until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, organizers are grappling with numerous challenges, including transportation, communications, ticketing, security, and visa uncertainties. The tournament, set to be the largest in history with 48 teams playing in 16 cities across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, faces uncertainties regarding visa processing, especially after the Trump administration re-imposed a travel ban on individuals from 12 countries. Concerns also arise from civil unrest related to immigration raids in Southern California, potentially threatening the success of the event. The economic impact is projected to exceed $40 billion, but logistical complexities and political factors present significant obstacles.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland experienced a fourth consecutive night of disorder, with incidents in Portadown involving masonry thrown at police, though at a lower level than previous days. The unrest began in Ballymena following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, resulting in 41 injured officers and 15 arrests. In Portadown, a crowd pulled bricks from a derelict building to throw at police, prompting warnings of baton rounds. Police Chief Constable Jon Boutcher described the violence as "racist", and said families hid in attics during the disturbances in Ballymena.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran and Israel have been adversaries for decades, but they were allies until Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. After the revolution, Iran scrapped all agreements with Israel and adopted an increasingly harsh rhetoric against it. The hostility has persisted under current leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has questioned the Holocaust. While some Iranians support the government's stance, others advocate for reassessing relations with Israel, but staunch supporters of Iran's Islamic Republic remain committed to opposing Israel and supporting the "Axis of Resistance."</p>

          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing is encouraging the use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters pivot to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. These L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, typically have a payment period of one year and can be used in both physical goods and trade in services.</p>

          <p>German machinery makers, represented by the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), are calling for the EU to implement trade barriers to protect them from Chinese competition. The industry, once supportive of Sino-German economic ties, now faces dwindling exports and stronger Chinese competitors backed by state subsidies. The VDMA advocates for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a particular focus on China's aggressive export policy. The group believes that Chinese companies are heavily subsidized and often disregard technical regulations, creating an unfair playing field.</p>

          <p>Japan anticipates receiving special treatment in tariff negotiations with the United States, as suggested by Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, following hints from U.S. President Donald Trump about raising import levies on cars. Akazawa believes that once bilateral negotiations are finalized, Japan will be treated differently from other countries. This comes as Trump indicated a potential increase in auto import tariffs to attract more investment in American manufacturing, which could negatively impact Japan's automotive industry. Akazawa is visiting Washington to progress talks before a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump.</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, less than a month after it capsized during the first attempted launch, state media reports. The country's leader, Kim Jong Un, had reacted furiously to the warship's failed launch in May, and demanded it be quickly repaired. At least four officials - three shipyard officials and one senior official - have since been arrested over the incident. State media says the ship has now been fully restored.

          <p>Markets in Asia opened lower, and oil prices surged after Israel attacked Iran, escalating tensions over Tehran's nuclear program. U.S. benchmark crude oil and Brent crude both rose significantly, reflecting investor concerns about potential disruptions. Tokyo's Nikkei 225, Seoul's Kospi, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, and the Shanghai Composite Index all experienced declines. The S&P 500 rose on Thursday following positive inflation data, but Boeing's stock fell after the Air India crash. Xu Tiachen of The Economist Intelligence suggests Asian markets are expected to recover quickly due to limited exposure to the conflict and ties to unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent attacks on Iran reflect a strategic decision to act now, driven by a belief that Iran is currently as debilitated as it will be in the region, particularly after the degradation of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt the opportunity to act was now, even without American approval. The attacks targeted facilities for making nuclear fuel, assembling bombs, and building rockets, as well as key Iranian nuclear and military personnel. The situation carries risks of Iranian retaliation, but Israel likely calculated these risks to be less severe given Iran's current state.</p>
