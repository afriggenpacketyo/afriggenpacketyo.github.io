Sarah Loving captured video of one of two bears climbing the stairs and sliding down the slide headfirst. Bears have become common in the suburban community, often overturning garbage cans in search of food. The family found the bear's antics amusing, joking that it had probably used the playset before.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reversed a Biden administration policy that limited the pursuit of reporters’ records in leak investigations. The new policy allows federal authorities to seek reporters’ phone records and compel their testimony to safeguard a broader range of government secrets. First Amendment advocates express concern over the potential for intrusive efforts to identify and prosecute leakers, given President Trump’s confrontational approach to the press.

Senator Ed Markey has criticized the tariffs as 'recklessly imposed' and called on the Small Business Administration to protect smaller enterprises. Some small business owners say tariffs are already threatening their livelihoods, as higher import costs make their products less competitive.

          <p>Former U.S. Rep. George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges in New York. Prosecutors say Santos defrauded voters and donors by fabricating parts of his backstory. Santos read a statement to the judge, apologizing and admitting he betrayed his supporters. He was ousted from Congress after the House Ethics Committee detailed his misconduct. Santos must pay more than $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture. Optimism score 15</p>
