          <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, streaming viewership of the 2024 Oscar-winning film “Conclave,” which portrays the selection of a new pope, experienced a significant surge. Luminate, a tracking firm, reported a substantial increase in streaming minutes for “Conclave” and Netflix’s “The Two Popes.” Before Amazon Prime Video made “Conclave” available for free to subscribers, the film saw a dramatic rise in daily U.S. streaming viewership, indicating that the Pope's death, combined with Amazon's promotional decision, heavily influenced viewing habits. The data revealed a week-over-week viewership increase of over 3,200 percent.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for stating that Kyiv will not recognize Russian control of Crimea, arguing that this stance is detrimental to peace negotiations. Trump claims a deal to end the war was "very close" but Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms "will do nothing but prolong" the conflict. US Vice-President JD Vance proposed a deal that would "freeze the territorial lines close to where they are today", requiring both sides to cede some territory. Meanwhile, Russia intensified attacks on Ukraine, with nine people killed in a drone strike on a bus.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has warned that the U.S. will cease its efforts to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine if Moscow and Kyiv do not reach an agreement. President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his refusal to recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea, deeming it harmful to peace negotiations. Zelenskyy responded by reposting a 2018 statement from Mike Pompeo reaffirming the U.S. policy of not recognizing the Kremlin's claims over seized territory. These developments occurred as officials from the U.S., France, the U.K., Germany, and Ukraine convened in London to discuss securing a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in npj Mental Health Research indicates that regular probiotic use may improve mood and reduce negative feelings such as anxiety, stress, and fatigue. The study tracked daily mood reports from young, healthy adults who took either daily probiotics or a placebo over a month. Researchers noted that the beneficial effects of probiotics on mood became apparent after about two weeks of daily use, with similar timescales to antidepressants. While the study suggests a possible link between probiotics and improved mental health, researchers emphasize that probiotics are not a substitute for psychiatric medication.</p>

          <p>The stock market's recent two-day rally is largely attributed to a short squeeze, where short sellers are forced to cover their losses by buying back borrowed stocks. Increased short positions in the market, driven by bearish wagers following earlier market volatility, created an environment ripe for dramatic upswings. The rally occurred despite a lack of tangible news, highlighting the impact of short covering on market dynamics. This phenomenon underscores the potential for sudden and significant market movements when many investors are betting against the same securities.</p>
