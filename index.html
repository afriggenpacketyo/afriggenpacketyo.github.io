          <p>A significant measles outbreak in western Texas has surpassed 600 cases, with the majority occurring among unvaccinated children and teenagers. The outbreak, centered in Gaines County, has led to at least 64 hospitalizations. Public health officials are concerned as similar measles cases have been confirmed in Montana, Louisiana, Missouri, and Virginia, marking the first instances in Montana in 35 years. The CDC reports 800 measles cases across 24 states, with 97% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals. The CDC emphasizes the importance of the MMR vaccine, with two doses being 97% effective against measles, and officials worry that the ongoing outbreak could threaten the U.S.'s measles elimination status. </p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has reached 500 days in office, marked by radical pro-market reforms. While some Argentinians express optimism, others remain skeptical of his policies. Milei's key move includes lifting currency controls, leading to peso stabilization and decreased inflation. However, critics point to the 'social chainsaw massacre' of wage cuts and public sector austerity, while supporters emphasize the potential for long-term economic recovery through foreign investment and trade agreements. Early signs of success include a slight decrease in poverty, but pensioners and the working class are bearing the brunt of austerity measures.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is in Washington D.C. lobbying the Trump administration to sign a proposed US-UK trade deal. The draft agreement, which the UK government says is ready to sign, hinges on the reduction of US tariffs on UK steel, cars, and aluminum, in exchange for a UK reduction in the digital services tax paid by US companies. Concerns arise over potential tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, a major UK export, which could necessitate renegotiation. Despite the potential trade boost, the IMF recently downgraded the UK's growth forecast, citing domestic factors like government borrowing costs and higher energy costs as primary reasons. </p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that he anticipates a de-escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China in the near future. Speaking at a private investor summit, Bessent stated that the current tariff situation is unsustainable and that easing tensions should bring relief to markets. Bessent suggested that the prospect of de-escalation between the economic superpowers "should give the world, the markets, a sigh of relief."

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in *Mahmoud v. Taylor*, a case concerning LGBTQ-inclusive books in Maryland public schools, with a majority of Republican justices appearing critical of the school district's policies. The case involves parents objecting to the use of books with LGBTQ characters in classrooms and whether they should be allowed to opt their children out of classes where these books are featured. Justices explored the balance between parental rights and the ability of public schools to function, with concerns raised about the potential for overly broad rules that could disrupt classroom instruction on various topics. The court seemed divided on how narrowly or broadly to rule, with some justices focusing on specific aspects of the case, such as alleged animus toward religion.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey reveals that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. Concerns have arisen that Musk's controversial political activities and support for President Trump are alienating potential buyers, leading to protests at Tesla offices. The survey highlights a significant divide, with Democrats and young people expressing more positive views of electric vehicles in general, but negative views of Tesla specifically. While Republicans are more positive about Tesla, they are generally negative on EVs, posing a challenge for the company's broader market appeal.</p>

The current universal tariff rate is 10%, while tariffs on Chinese goods imported to the United States are as high as 145%.</p>

          <p>Rep. Byron Donalds faced a barrage of shouting at a town hall meeting in Florida while defending President Trump's agenda, including cuts to federal spending and the elimination of diversity initiatives. Donalds defended the Department of Government Efficiency and emphasized his success in banking, asserting that Black children can succeed without DEI programs. The town hall grew increasingly contentious, with clashes over issues ranging from U.S. support for Israel to discussions about race and social hierarchy.</p>

          <h2>Trump Dismisses More Immigration Judges Amid Deportation Push</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired more immigration judges, adding to criticism that migrants are not receiving due process before deportation. The firings come as the administration aims to increase deportations and reduce the backlog of immigration cases. Critics argue that firing judges hinders the ability to process cases efficiently, with millions of cases already pending. The administration is also pressuring judges to expedite case reviews and drop asylum cases without hearings.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order that partly targets a key provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, which allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. The proposed change could benefit pharmaceutical companies by extending the period before small-molecule drugs are eligible for negotiation. The change could lead to increased Medicare prescription drug spending and higher medication prices. The order also calls for the FDA to open a pathway for more drug imports from Canada, where prescription medications are cheaper.</p>
