          <h2>Trump Proposes 100% Tariffs on Foreign-Made Films, Citing National Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 02:25:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, claiming it is a national security threat due to other countries' incentives for filmmakers. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment, while uncertainty surrounds whether the tariff would apply to all foreign films or only those receiving foreign tax incentives. This move follows previous trade actions, including China reducing the quota of American films allowed into the country, and raises concerns about the impact on the global film industry and potential retaliation from other nations, as well as the livelihoods of middle-class film workers in the United States. The article also mentions Trump's appointment of film stars as special ambassadors to bring Hollywood business back to America.</p>

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to labor disputes and a debt crisis, forcing some pilots to seek alternative employment in the gig economy. The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs using Chinese-made aircraft. The suspension is attributed to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed rail expansion offers cheaper alternatives, impeding Joy Air's cash flow. This situation highlights the challenges faced by regional airlines in China amid increasing competition and infrastructure development.</p>

Separately, Japan and India are expected to deepen defense cooperation amid China's growing military presence. Japan also stated it would not use its U.S. bond holdings as leverage in trade talks, and the country's 2024 development aid is projected to rank fourth in the OECD.</p>

The maximum-security facility, closed in 1963 and now a tourist site, would serve as a symbol of his administration's tough stance on crime.

          <h2>Japan's Development Aid Ranking Falls to Fourth in OECD</h2>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was mainly due to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with the sharp increases in 2022 and 2023. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence, although it faces a tight fiscal situation.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he defied President Trump's request to overturn the 2020 election results. Caroline Kennedy praised Pence for upholding his constitutional responsibilities, while Pence emphasized the importance of the Constitution as the common ground for Americans. Pence's actions on January 6 have been praised by some as courageous, while others, particularly Trump loyalists, view him as a traitor. Since leaving office, Pence has occasionally criticized Trump's policies and actions.</p>

One oiled bird was spotted, and federal maps indicate pollutants have drifted into a protected area for endangered sea turtles.

          <p>A change in U.S. tax law, combined with existing tariffs, is forcing apparel makers in Guangzhou, China, to consider alternative markets or cheaper locations. The end of a tax exemption on inexpensive goods entering the U.S. has made it difficult for factories to sell on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu. Many factories are considering relocating to provinces with lower wages or to countries like Vietnam to avoid tariffs. This situation highlights the challenges faced by Chinese garment makers amid rising trade tensions and declining orders.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's chancellor amidst a time of profound reckoning for the nation. While Germany needs a unifier, Merz's instincts are to divide, as evidenced by his failed migration bill and flirtation with the far-right AfD. His policy shifts and controversial statements have resulted in low approval ratings, and his approach risks empowering more radical political shifts. The article suggests that Merz needs to show that he can be the chancellor for all Germans and chart a path towards the future, but his record offers little reason for optimism.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the biggest inconvenience for visitors to Japan is the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations. Many visitors reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodation due to the scarcity of bins. While the figure improved from the previous year, the issue remains a concern. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks, but it has led to increased littering in tourist spots.</p>
