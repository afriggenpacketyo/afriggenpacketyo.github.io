        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of State Security announced it has thwarted three separate spying plots, warning public officials to be vigilant against foreign intelligence operations. One case involved a provincial government employee who was allegedly ensnared in a "honey trap" by a foreign agent's "seductive beauty" and blackmailed into providing state secrets. Another case involved a worker selling confidential documents to cover gambling debts, while a third official lost his job for sharing sensitive information with a relative. These disclosures come amid escalating espionage accusations between Beijing and Western nations, particularly the United States.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the University of Florida are championing the "food is medicine" movement to address America's declining health, as detailed in a recent article. They argue that increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is crucial for preventing chronic diseases, yet only one in ten U.S. adults meets the daily recommendation. The study highlights that current agricultural output is insufficient to meet these needs and advocates for a major increase in producing nutrient-dense foods like berries and leafy greens. Experts suggest that even frozen produce retains its nutritional value, offering an accessible way for people to improve their dietary habits.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, has killed at least 15 Palestinians, including eight children and two women, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. The victims were reportedly queuing for nutritional supplements near a medical point when the strike occurred. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the strike targeted a Hamas terrorist who participated in the October 7th attack and said it regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals, adding that the incident is under review. This event takes place as indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue in Doha.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with disruptive cyber attacks on retailers Marks & Spencer and the Co-op. A 20-year-old woman and three teenage males were detained on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and organized crime offenses. The attacks, which began in mid-April, involved data theft and ransomware, causing significant operational chaos and bare shelves for the retailers. The chairman of M&S stated the hack felt like an attempt to destroy the business, which estimates it will lose £300 million in profits due to the disruption.</p>

          <p>A Republican reconciliation package signed by President Trump includes substantial cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially affecting millions of families. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, the legislation's changes would cause 22.3 million families to lose some or all benefits, with an average loss of $146 per month for the most affected. The cuts are primarily achieved by expanding work requirements to older individuals and parents of teenagers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the changes will reduce SNAP funding by about $186 billion over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

The letters, sent by the Attorney General to tech companies, instructed them to ignore a law banning TikTok, arguing it interfered with the president's foreign policy authority. Critics argue this asserts a power so broad that it was abolished in the 1689 English Bill of Rights, as it would allow a president to unilaterally decide which laws apply to whom, undermining a core principle of constitutional law.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to cut most U.S. foreign aid is having a severe impact on HIV treatment programs in South Africa, threatening to reverse decades of progress. The funding cuts have forced the closure of numerous USAID-funded clinics that provided antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to thousands of patients, including vulnerable populations like sex workers. Health experts and organizations like UNAids warn that this could lead to a resurgence in HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths, and also sets back critical research into new vaccines and treatments that was being conducted in the country.</p>

          <p>Police in Western Australia are appealing for public assistance in the search for a 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, who has been missing for over a week. Her van was discovered unattended with apparent mechanical issues in a remote area about 300 km northeast of Perth. Authorities describe her disappearance as "unexplained" and "concerning," as she had been in regular contact with her family before she went missing. The investigation is broad, as she had planned to travel to remote parts of the state as well as the eastern coast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times examines how implementing ranked-choice voting could significantly alter California's political dynamics. Proponents argue the system, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference, could eliminate costly runoff elections, increase voter turnout, and foster less negative campaigning. In California's nonpartisan primary system, it could also provide more opportunities for underrepresented parties and potentially lead to more centrist outcomes by rewarding candidates who can secure second- and third-choice votes from a broader electorate.</p>

          <p>Detectives are investigating new historical sexual abuse allegations against a recently convicted former bishop and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. One victim has come forward publicly, questioning how a "predator" was promoted to bishop years after initial concerns about his behavior were reported to church officials in 1986 but ignored. This investigation adds to the crisis facing the Church in Wales, with victims now calling for a full independent inquiry into what they describe as a culture of concealment and failure to protect the vulnerable.</p>

          <p>A newly approved redistricting map in Tarrant County, Texas, is being heavily criticized as partisan and racial gerrymandering. The plan, pushed through by the Republican-led commissioners court, is expected to dilute the votes of people of color in one precinct to create an opening for a GOP candidate. Political experts see this local move as a blueprint for a broader Republican strategy to secure political advantages ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, particularly as Texas becomes more politically competitive and the state's GOP faces internal divisions.</p>

Seoul faces a difficult path, as Washington has also reportedly demanded concessions on sensitive issues like opening its protected rice market and increasing payments for hosting U.S. troops.

          <p>A century after the famous Scopes "Monkey Trial" in Dayton, Tennessee, a retrospective article examines its enduring legacy on American culture. The 1925 courtroom battle over the teaching of evolution, featuring Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan, became a symbol of the clash between science and religious fundamentalism. The author notes that while often viewed as a win for science, the trial did not resolve the underlying conflict. The same debates over public education, scientific authority, and biblical literalism continue to animate American politics and society 100 years later.</p>
