          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts criticized President Trump's call to impeach a federal judge who blocked Trump's deportation plan. Roberts stated that impeachment is not an appropriate response to judicial decisions; the appellate review process is the proper recourse.  The judge's orders temporarily halted deportations of alleged gang members, prompting Trump's criticism and the Justice Department's appeal.</p>
