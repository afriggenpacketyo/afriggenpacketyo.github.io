          <p>Northern China, particularly Beijing, has once again been struck by severe and deadly floods during its traditional rainy season in July and August. This year's disaster marks the fifth major flooding event in the region since 2012. The recent storms have been noted as unusual because they primarily impacted the northern areas of the capital. This is in contrast to the severe floods of 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern regions, highlighting a shift in weather patterns.</p>

          <p>New FC Barcelona signee Marcus Rashford is set for his home debut, but his initial weeks have been overshadowed by significant off-pitch issues at the club. The article details a dispute involving the captain, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, which nearly delayed the registration of new players due to financial regulations. Additionally, ongoing delays in the Camp Nou stadium reconstruction mean his debut will be at a small training ground. Despite the chaos, Rashford has made a promising start on the pitch during the pre-season tour.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is facing a renewed and accelerated nuclear arms race, marked by Russia's withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and provocative rhetoric from both Russian and U.S. leaders. The author contends that unlike the passionate anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, today's growing danger is met with an eerie public silence and complacency. The piece highlights the massive spending on nuclear arsenals by the nine nuclear-armed states and the collapse of arms-control agreements, urging a revival of public opposition to prevent a potential catastrophe.</p>

The film focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang, portraying his actions as a reunification effort against foreign-backed jihadists. This production is part of a broader effort by Beijing to reinforce its official historical claims over its borderlands. The documentary seeks to promote a unified "sense of community for the Chinese nation," a concept advanced by President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <h2>Kentucky Bourbon Industry Faces Downturn Amid Economic Pressures and Trade Disputes</h2>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom post-2008, is now facing a bust due to a combination of economic factors. Slowing sales, post-pandemic inflation, and changing drinking habits among younger generations have contributed to the downturn. The situation is exacerbated by global trade disputes, particularly retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada, which have severely impacted exports. This has led to an oversupply, falling prices, and a growing number of distillery bankruptcies and closures in the state. (not investment advice)</p>
