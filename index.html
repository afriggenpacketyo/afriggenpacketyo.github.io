          <p>According to a recent Gallup poll, Lee Jae-myung, the opposition party leader, is projected to win South Korea's snap presidential election, positioning him to potentially succeed ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee previously lost to Yoon by a small margin in 2022 but now holds a significant lead, with 49% of respondents favoring him compared to 35% for his rival, Kim Moon Soo. Eurasia Group analysts also consider Lee the clear favorite, estimating his odds of victory at 80%, and Goldman Sachs noted similarities in the economic goals of both candidates, including economic growth and housing affordability. The Bank of Korea recently cut rates to their lowest level since August 2022, anticipating a considerable decline in economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent Water Commission review has found that the water sector in England and Wales is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The review cited public trust being shaken by pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures, with no single change being enough to deliver the necessary fundamental reset. Environment Secretary Steve Reed acknowledged the water system is broken and promised a full government response to the commission's findings, which considered over 50,000 responses from the public, environmental groups, regulators, and water companies. The sector faces increasing pressure from climate change, population growth, and decades of underinvestment, with sewage spills lasting over 3.6 million hours in both 2023 and 2024.</p>

          <p>Following technical and logistical issues with the February California bar exam, over 200 test-takers will have their scores changed from "fail" to "pass" after a committee approved new scoring adjustments. The grading change increased the overall pass rate from 56% to 63%, and applicants who nearly passed will be given the higher of two scores for each written question. The State Bar of California has already implemented a lower raw passing score and "imputed" scores for test takers who failed to complete significant portions of the exam. Some state Bar trustees have expressed concerns about the proposed remedies and higher pass rate, citing the bar's duty to protect the public from unqualified lawyers.</p>

This follows revelations that MI5 lied to three courts about an agent known as X, who used his role to coerce and terrorize his girlfriend, even attacking her with a machete. A panel of High Court judges will now consider potential actions regarding MI5's false evidence, including contempt of court proceedings.</p>

          <p>This article explores the paradox of Xi Jinping's leadership by examining the life of his father, Xi Zhongxun, who was purged by the Communist Party but later helped reform Chinese politics. While Xi Zhongxun contributed to political reform, his son has become the most authoritarian leader since Mao Zedong. By understanding Xi Zhongxun's experiences, the article aims to shed light on the factors that have shaped Xi Jinping's approach to governance. The analysis provides insights into the complex dynamics of Chinese politics and the contrasting legacies within the Xi family.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank will refrain from aggressively raising policy rates unless economic and price conditions improve, citing significant uncertainty due to U.S. tariffs. Ueda emphasized that the BOJ will not raise rates simply to create room for future easing, but will continue its policy of gradually increasing rates if economic and price developments align with expectations. This cautious approach follows the BOJ's recent downward revision of economic growth and price projections for the current fiscal year. Trade frictions stemming from U.S. tariffs could potentially slow the global economy and negatively impact domestic company profits, influencing the timing of future rate hikes.
