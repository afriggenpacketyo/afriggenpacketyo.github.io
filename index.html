          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, has agreed to a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. He will plead guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, resulting in four consecutive life sentences. This agreement, which includes waiving all appeal rights, was reached after his defense team approached prosecutors and aims to bring closure to the victims' families without a lengthy trial and appeals process.</p>

The report recommends improving access through NHS apps, expanding services, and better utilizing health visitors to address the concerning trend and close vaccination inequality gaps.</p>

While this provides immediate relief, concerns persist about affordability during the upcoming winter, as prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Analysts predict only a minor further drop in October, and global uncertainty could still impact wholesale prices, prompting Ofgem to encourage consumers to consider fixed-rate deals for more stability.

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in US inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs, and using logistical loopholes to delay payments. However, experts caution that this buffering effect may be temporary and that consumers could still see prices rise in the latter half of the year as these strategies are exhausted.

          <p>Deliberations have begun in the federal sex trafficking trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, with the jury of eight men and four women weighing charges that could result in a life sentence. Shortly after beginning, the jury sent a note to the judge expressing concerns about one juror's ability to follow instructions, though they were told to resume their work. The case hinges on weeks of graphic testimony from accusers, with prosecutors arguing Combs used power and violence, while his defense claims the case is about money.</p>
