          <p>After an 11-week blockade, the UN reported that 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid, including flour, baby food, and medical equipment, were collected inside the Gaza Strip after Israel eased restrictions. However, the UN emphasizes that this amount is "nowhere near enough" to address the extensive needs of the 2.1 million residents facing acute hunger and skyrocketing prices. Humanitarian organizations warn of dire conditions, with reports indicating that 29 children have already died from starvation-related causes. The article highlights the challenges in safely distributing aid due to security concerns and the need for a sustained ceasefire to ensure adequate assistance reaches the population.

          <p>Millions of public sector workers in the UK, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay rises ranging from 3.6% to 4.5% following government acceptance of pay review body recommendations. This decision comes after unions threatened action over the initially budgeted 2.8% increase. While education unions have welcomed the rises, they caution that school budgets will suffer without additional funding. The government plans to cover the costs through savings from existing budgets, including cuts to temporary staff and the abolishment of NHS England, aiming to avoid cuts to frontline services.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed anger after a newly built naval destroyer was damaged during a launch ceremony due to "absolute carelessness." The 5,000-ton-class warship became unbalanced, causing damage to its bottom sections. Kim blamed military officials, scientists, and shipyard operators for the incident, calling for a Workers' Party meeting to address the errors. Experts suggest the disclosure indicates Kim's commitment to naval advancement despite setbacks, with potential Russian assistance in developing the warship's systems.

Alberta's conservative leader, Danielle Smith, seeks leverage to radically renegotiate Albertaâ€™s relationship with the federal government, primarily to unshackle the provinceâ€™s oil industry from climate change regulations.

          <p>Leadership and workplace researcher Zach Mercurio asserts that successful leaders excel at small talk, using it to build trust and rapport with employees.

Without such interaction, remote workers and those in underappreciated positions may feel disconnected and insignificant.

          <p>Republicans in the House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill, but it faces a complicated path through the Senate. The bill includes amendments designed to appeal to both moderates and hardline conservatives, such as Medicaid work requirements and an increase in the cap on deductions for state and local taxes. Democrats are opposed to the bill's cuts to the social safety net. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would decrease resources for the lowest-income households while increasing resources for the highest-income households.

          <p>A new book alleges that former White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates was the "tip of the spear" in defending President Joe Biden's mental acuity, often without full knowledge of the presidentâ€™s condition. The book claims that the Biden administration attacked journalists who questioned the presidentâ€™s age and fitness, aiming to create a disincentive for reporting on the issue. Bates has dismissed the book's narrative as distorted, while a former Biden White House staffer defended Bates' role and character.
