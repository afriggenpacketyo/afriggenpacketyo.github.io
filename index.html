          <p>Coventry City Football Club has announced the purchase of its home ground, the Coventry Building Society Arena, a move described by the owner as a "pivotal moment." This acquisition from Frasers Group is intended to provide long-term stability and safeguard the club's future after years of uncertainty regarding its stadium. The purchase ends a tumultuous period for supporters since the club left its previous home in 2005, and is seen as a statement of ambition that will allow for investment in facilities and the fan experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public schools across El Salvador are now enforcing new stringent discipline rules mandated by the government of President Nayib Bukele. These regulations require students to have military-style haircuts, wear clean uniforms, and offer respectful greetings to teachers, with non-compliance by principals considered a serious breach. The move, overseen by the new military-affiliated Education Minister, is defended as necessary for restoring classroom order but has been criticized by some teachers' unions as a "militarization" of education. This policy is part of a broader trend of authoritarian measures under the Bukele administration.</p>

          <p>Idaho State Police have publicly released hundreds of photographs from their investigation into the murders of four University of Idaho students. The images include Bryan Kohberger's seized white Hyundai Elantra, showing a filthy exterior and a white substance inside, as well as photos from the off-campus rental house where the crimes occurred. While investigators did not find victim DNA in the car, the photos provide a glimpse into the crime scene and the evidence collection process. The release comes as Kohberger serves four life sentences for the murders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, criticizing its focus on slavery, echo a century-old historical revisionist tactic. The article draws parallels between Trump's rhetoric and the "Lost Cause" myth promoted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which sought to downplay the brutality of slavery and rebrand the Confederacy. This effort to control the historical narrative is seen as a political strategy to undermine accounts of Black history and progress. The museum, which has welcomed over 10 million visitors, serves as a key educational resource, particularly as Black history curricula face challenges in some states.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers and human rights advocates are demanding the immediate closure of Camp East Montana, a new immigration detention facility at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas. Critics describe the sprawling tent facility, set to become the nation's largest, as a "dangerous misuse of military land" and express concerns over a lack of oversight and inadequate access to legal services for detainees. The Trump administration defends the camp as a necessary short-term processing site to handle accelerating arrests and deportations.

          <p>A wave of younger, social media-savvy Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents, citing a need for generational change and greater urgency. These challengers argue that the party's establishment has grown complacent and out of touch, failing to effectively counter the Trump administration and connect with a changing electorate. While incumbents defend their records and experience, the insurgents contend the divide is less about ideology and more about a willingness to fight for a new vision for the party. This trend reflects a broader debate within the Democratic party about its future direction and leadership.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has received his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne attended the brutal Florida reform school in the 1960s and later dropped out to support his family, but he never gave up on his goal of graduating. He achieved his diploma through a compensation program established for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne hopes his story of perseverance serves as an inspiration for others to overcome obstacles and never give up on their goals.</p>

He describes Mars as an awful, uninhabitable place with poisoned dirt, deadly radiation, and no breathable air, stating that even a catastrophic event on Earth would not make it a worse place to live. Becker contends that focusing on Mars as a 'Plan B' distracts from the urgent need to solve problems and improve life on our own planet.

Unlike most sunscreens that only filter UV radiation, tinted versions containing iron oxide can prevent skin damage from the entire light spectrum. While the focus in dermatology has often been on skin cancer, which is less common in people of color, this highlights the importance of addressing conditions that have a significant psychosocial impact.

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, shooting fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This marks the 31st such event since December, with the activity contained and posing no threat to homes. The spectacular display is caused by magma rising through narrow vents, creating pressure that results in towering fountains of molten rock. For Native Hawaiians, the eruption is a culturally significant event, connecting them to ancient stories of the volcano goddess Pele, and it continues to draw visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</p>

          <p>Utility bills are rising across the United States, with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the past year. Experts attribute the price hikes primarily to a surge in energy demand from data centers, AI expansion, and electrification, rather than a shift to renewables. The article notes that while there is ample clean energy ready to be connected to the grid, transmission backlogs and equipment shortages are significant hurdles. Policy changes under the Trump administration, which favor fossil fuels and curtail renewable projects, are also projected to increase costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The change honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century Ghanaian-born scholar who became the first Black philosopher to earn a doctorate at a European university. For decades, civil society groups have campaigned to change the name "Mohrenstrasse," as the term "Mohr" (Moor) is a derogatory historical term for Black people.

          <p>A significant political battle over congressional redistricting is unfolding between Texas and California, with major implications for the U.S. House of Representatives. After Texas's Republican-led legislature passed a new map creating five more GOP-favoring districts mid-decade, California's Democratic lawmakers responded by advancing their own map to add five Democratic-leaning seats. This "arms race" is driven by the tight balance of power in Washington and could set a precedent for other states ahead of the midterm elections. The legality of these partisan gerrymandering efforts is being questioned, with potential court challenges expected.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" has succeeded in satirizing the second Trump administration, a feat that has proven difficult for many other comedy shows. The article argues that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have effectively targeted figures like Trump, JD Vance, and Kristi Noem with gratifyingly mean-spirited caricatures that avoid preachy moralizing. By using their established comedic tools, such as depicting Trump with the same animation and voice as their past portrayal of Saddam Hussein, the show delivers pointed commentary. This approach has allowed "South Park" to land comedic blows where others have struggled, making it a relevant voice in today's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The White House Rose Garden has undergone a significant renovation, with its central lawn being replaced by a stone patio at a cost of $1.9 million. President Trump stated the change was necessary because the grass would get wet, causing women's high heels to sink. The new design, funded by private donations, features paving stones, new drainage systems, and patio furniture with umbrellas that resemble those at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. While the iconic flower beds and trees from the Kennedy-era design remain, the transformation of the lawn into a hardscaped event space marks another of the administration's modifications to the historic residence.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has announced a plan for the mass deportation of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK via small boats, calling the situation a "massive crisis." The proposal involves arresting arrivals, detaining them on disused military bases, and returning them to their home countries, which could face significant legal and political challenges. Farage also advocates for withdrawing the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights to facilitate the plan. The Labour government criticized the proposal as "pie in the sky," while the Conservatives claimed the ideas were recycled from their own policies.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have both been denied parole by California officials. The decision comes shortly after a judge resentenced them, making them eligible for release under a youthful offender law. However, parole boards determined that both brothers, now in their 50s, still pose a risk to public safety and have not been fully rehabilitated. The case, which has divided public opinion for decades, recently regained prominence due to a popular Netflix drama series. The brothers will be eligible to seek parole again in three years.</p>

          <p>Japan has announced a major infrastructure initiative aimed at developing a logistics network across Africa and the Indian Ocean, potentially creating competition with China's Belt and Road Initiative. This move signals a resurgence of infrastructure-driven geopolitical influence, but this time largely without U.S. involvement. Analysts warn that continued competition between Japan, China, and India could lead to wasted resources and incompatible technical standards for projects like railways.

          <p>German authorities are investigating a suspicious fire that damaged railway track switches in the western city of Wuppertal late Friday night. According to the rail operator Deutsche Bahn, cables appear to have been deliberately cut and set on fire, possibly with an accelerant. State security investigators have been called to the scene, treating the incident as suspected arson against critical infrastructure. This event follows other recent deliberate attacks on railway equipment in the same region, raising concerns about the security of Germany's transport systems, though this specific fire caused minimal disruption to train services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for Puer tea, a fermented tea from Yunnan province long valued as an investment in China, is experiencing a significant downturn. Prices for premium Puer, once considered a stable asset, have plummeted this year, with some high-end products crashing to their lowest values since 2019. This decline is attributed to China's broader economic slowdown, reduced corporate profits, and a decrease in business gift-giving due to fiscal tightening and anti-corruption campaigns. The bursting of the "drinkable antique" bubble reflects waning investor appetite and broader economic strains in the country. (not investment advice)</p>
