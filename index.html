        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, even happy couples experience conflict, and the subjects of these disagreements reveal underlying issues in the relationship. The most common source of conflict is tone of voice or attitude, which can signal contempt, a predictor of divorce. Other frequent issues include family relations, household chores, and communication styles, all of which often stem from unmet needs or misalignments. The psychologist suggests strategies such as naming the effect of condescension, reassuring one another, acknowledging the invisible load of domestic work, and using a designated word or phrase for taking time-outs during arguments.

The Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, departed Sicily last Sunday with 12 activists aboard, aiming to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza. The coalition has accused Israel of jamming their communications as they approach Gaza, and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, claims she will be illegally detained by Israeli authorities. While Israel has begun allowing some basic aid into Gaza, humanitarian workers warn of famine unless the blockade ends. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests in response to citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to the deployment of National Guard troops. Activists organized a protest outside Los Angeles City Hall, while approximately 300 National Guard troops were deployed to protect federal property and personnel. The unrest began after ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations, resulting in the arrests of 118 immigrants, some with links to criminal organizations. Protests erupted in Paramount and Compton, with demonstrators clashing with law enforcement and causing damage to property. </p>

          <p>The government is considering implementing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media, with proposals including a two-hour cap on individual apps and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones as a concern. However, online safety campaigners, including Ian Russell, whose daughter died after seeing harmful content online, criticize the government for delaying tougher online safety laws. While parental controls and some app-based time limits already exist, uptake is reportedly low, prompting the government to consider further action to ensure a healthy online life for children.</p>

          <p>President Trump is initiating another assault on democracy by deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles to confront protests against ICE actions, using a dubious legal justification. By militarizing the situation, Trump aims to provoke Americans and justify using armed force against them, potentially suppressing free elections in the future. He views the U.S. military as his personal force and seeks to radicalize citizen-soldiers in the National Guard, hoping to create a national emergency that enables authoritarian control. The author argues that the public should avoid confrontations and instead ensure calm streets to deny Trump the political advantage he seeks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests is drawing criticism for potentially escalating tensions. Despite reports that the protests were largely peaceful, Trump administration officials claim that immigration agents were being targeted and injured. Over the objections of California Governor Gavin Newsom, Trump federalized 2,000 National Guard soldiers, with the possibility of deploying U.S. Marines as well. </p>

          <p>England defeated the West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series win with one game to spare. Jos Buttler and Harry Brook contributed with the bat, while Jacob Bethell and Tom Banton provided crucial late-innings hitting to chase down a target of 197. Earlier, West Indies had posted 196, with significant contributions from Shai Hope, Rovman Powell, and Jason Holder, despite a strong start from England's Luke Wood. Adil Rashid's expensive final over proved costly for England, but their batting performance ultimately secured the victory. </p>

          <p>President Trump's swift deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to isolated protests is raising concerns about federal overreach and infringement on states' rights. Local officials have expressed that they did not want or need federal assistance, fearing that Trump's heavy-handed response could escalate the situation. The administration's actions have prompted fury among local Democratic officials, who view it as a political ploy. The deployment, authorized under Title 10, lacks clear historical precedent, as previous instances involved protecting civil rights marchers when local law enforcement was unwilling to do so. </p>
