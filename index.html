          <p>President Trump announced a delay in implementing a 50% tariff on European Union goods, pushing the start date from June 1 to July 9 to allow time for negotiations. This decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious trade talks. Trump initially threatened the tariffs due to frustrations with the EU's trade practices, causing market instability. The delay aims to facilitate a potential agreement and avoid further economic disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

The speech, written with input from the Canadian government, will likely convey a message that Canada is independent and not subject to U.S. influence, serving as a symbolic gesture of solidarity.</p>
