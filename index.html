          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that federal immigration agents have taken the family of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Colorado fire attack on demonstrators, into custody. The White House indicated that the family could be deported as early as tonight. Authorities are investigating whether Soliman's family had any knowledge or involvement in the attack, which targeted a group calling for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Soliman is an Egyptian national married with five children, and the family resides in Colorado Springs. Optimism regarding the safety of the public may be improved with this news.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that President Trump has privately expressed his frustration with his Supreme Court appointees, particularly Justice Amy Coney Barrett, feeling they are not sufficiently supportive of his agenda. Some Trump allies have echoed these sentiments, criticizing Barrett as "weak." Despite these private complaints, Trump has publicly defended Barrett in the past. He recently attacked Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo, who advised him on judicial nominations during his first term, calling him a 'sleazebag.' The president may disagree with the Court and some of its rulings, but he will always respect its foundational role.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its inception in 2022, the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will not attend the Ukraine Defense Contact Group's meeting to coordinate military aid. Hegseth's absence, along with no new military aid announcements from the U.S., signals a distancing from the Ukraine war effort. France and other NATO nations are concerned about the U.S. potentially withdrawing troops from Europe to focus on the Indo-Pacific region.

          <p>The England Lionesses experienced a mixed week of results as they prepare for the Euros. Mary Earps' international retirement and Millie Bright's withdrawal posed challenges for manager Wiegman. The team responded with a strong performance against Portugal but suffered a defeat against Spain in the Nations League. Wiegman emphasized the week's value in providing players with necessary minutes and experience, viewing the Spain loss as a learning opportunity. The team's performance is a mixed bag, with both positive and negative takeaways.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The UK will maintain the existing 25% tariff rate. A UK-US tariff pact signed in May aims to eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum, but it has not yet taken effect.

He cautioned that Beijing is not neutral and is in Russia's corner, diplomatically, economically and militarily.
