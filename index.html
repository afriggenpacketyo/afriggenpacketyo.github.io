          <p>A massive explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least 25 deaths and 800 injuries, with several people still missing. The blast caused widespread damage, affecting nearby buildings and vehicles, and prompted the closure of schools and offices in the region. While the exact cause remains under investigation, initial reports suggest improper handling of flammable materials or solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles may be responsible.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece highlights the United States' longstanding dilemma of balancing alliances with autocratic regimes against democratic values, focusing on President Erdogan's Turkey. Despite Turkey's strategic importance, Erdogan's increasing authoritarianism, including the arrest of political opponents, has raised concerns. The author criticizes the weak global response to Erdogan's actions and argues that democracies should do more to support the Turkish people and pressure the regime to respect democratic principles.</p>

          <p>A letter penned by Titanic passenger Colonel Archibald Gracie just days before the ship's sinking has sold for £300,000 at auction in the UK. The handwritten letter, dated April 10, 1912, the day Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton, contains what some have described as “prophetic” words. Gracie, who survived the disaster, wrote that he would “await my journey's end” before passing judgment on the “fine ship”.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case involving Trina Martin, whose Atlanta home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017, to determine the extent to which individuals can sue the federal government for law enforcement misconduct. Martin's lawsuit, accusing agents of assault, battery, and false arrest, was dismissed by lower courts, but the Supreme Court's decision could set a precedent for holding law enforcement accountable. The case highlights the challenges faced by families affected by mistaken raids and the legal recourse available to them.</p>
