          <h2>RFK Jr. Announces Plans to Phase Out Artificial Food Dyes in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 05:12:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to phase out the remaining eight artificial food dyes from America's food supply within two years. This initiative, announced on Tuesday, aims to address concerns about the potential harmful effects of these dyes, which are used in various products like cereal, ice cream, and snacks. The decision follows previous efforts to ban Red No. 3 due to cancer concerns in rats, with Kennedy also expected to approve additional natural dyes. This move aligns with similar actions taken by other countries and some US states, which have already banned or restricted the use of artificial food dyes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists indicates a growing concern that the United States is shifting towards authoritarianism. The survey, conducted by Bright Line Watch, reveals a significant drop in the rating of American democracy following President Trump's election. Scholars point to tactics such as expanding executive power, interfering with the press, and undermining checks and balances as evidence of this trend, drawing parallels to countries like Hungary and Turkey. While some disagree, arguing Trump is addressing long-standing issues, many democracy experts express alarm over the erosion of democratic norms and institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have made progress in treating advanced Parkinson's disease using stem cell therapy. In a phase 1 trial, donated stem cells were used to create dopamine-producing neurons, which were then transplanted into the brains of 12 patients. After 18 months, the cells had successfully integrated into the brain, leading to noticeable improvements in symptoms, particularly in the high-dose group, which reported an average of 2.7 hours of additional "on time" each day. The FDA has approved the researchers to proceed directly to a phase 3 clinical trial with a larger patient group in 2025.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case regarding the conflict between local school boards' authority to set curriculum and parents' religious objections to certain materials. The case centers on a Montgomery County, MD school system that included LGBTQ+ themed books in elementary school to promote tolerance, which some parents opposed due to religious beliefs. The parents requested opt-outs for their children, but the school board found the requests disruptive and logistically difficult. The court will consider whether forcing these books on children violates the Constitution's guarantee of free exercise of religion, balancing parental rights with the educational needs of a diverse student body.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly investing in gold ETFs as a hedge against geopolitical tensions and a volatile stock market. The 13 mainland-domiciled gold ETFs have attracted significant inflows this year, driven by gold's impressive performance amid global economic uncertainty and trade disputes. Analysts suggest that gold is becoming a preferred safe haven asset, replacing US Treasuries and the dollar. Spot gold prices have risen sharply, reflecting increased investor demand for the precious metal as a hedge against risk.</p>

The cuts come at a time when ACA enrollment is at an all-time high and new changes to the health law could create confusion and additional difficulties for consumers.

The central government has allowed local governments to expand their debt financing and has maintained faster credit growth, but further measures, such as stabilizing the property and stock markets, are needed to boost consumer spending.

These groups are allegedly involved in smuggling weapons, drugs, fuel, and people, with migrants being transported from Asia and Africa to Libya and then to Europe. Experts say the Kremlin has weaponized migration to exert pressure on the EU, and that Europe can best counteract people smuggling by offering migrants safe routes and checking them upon arrival.</p>

          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft, aiming to balance parity with player agency. Proposals include flipping the draft order to reward teams closer to the playoffs, implementing a lottery system for non-playoff teams, and waiving the eligibility rule to allow players to enter the draft earlier. Another suggestion is a salary pool system, where teams negotiate with prospects based on a tiered pool of money, giving players more control over their destination. These ideas seek to address concerns about top prospects winding up on poorly managed teams and to give players more say in their careers.</p>

          <p>The climate crisis is worsening the global affordable housing crisis, with extreme weather events and natural disasters driving up housing costs. As people escape high-risk areas, demand increases in safer locations, leading to "climate gentrification" and displacement of low-income residents. Post-disaster, housing becomes even more expensive, eroding available housing stock and putting pressure on rental supply. The article suggests that expanding housing stock, shifting housing density toward low-risk areas, and climate-forward retrofitting can help ensure affordability and climate resilience.</p>
