          <p>Bestselling author Kelly Corrigan advocates for using physical movement as a tool to overcome creative stagnation. She suggests simple breaks, such as a three-minute dance or walking during phone calls, can effectively reset mood and focus for those in creative or screen-focused professions. Corrigan also emphasizes working with one's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting them, suggesting that tidying one's workspace after a movement break can further enhance the creative environment. These small adjustments are presented as integral parts of the creative process, not just interruptions.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned commander of the Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 flight, which famously turned a near-catastrophe into a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion. He also served as the command module pilot for Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the moon, where he described Earth as a "grand oasis." NASA and his family remembered him as a hero whose character and courage inspired millions and demonstrated remarkable innovation under pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently implemented tariffs are prompting some economists to warn of a potential "stagflation" scenario, characterized by high inflation and low economic growth. The new import duties, which have raised the average tariff rate to its highest since 1934, could lead businesses to pass costs to consumers, fueling inflation. Simultaneously, these costs might cause businesses to scale back on hiring and expansion, potentially weakening the job market and slowing GDP growth. While the White House has dismissed these concerns, the Federal Reserve faces a challenging situation of managing risks to both inflation and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered an increased presence of federal law enforcement agencies to police Washington, D.C., following an attempted carjacking of a former administration staffer. The seven-day initiative, led by the U.S. Park Police, involves over a dozen federal agencies and is intended to combat violent crime in the nation's capital. This move follows President Trump's criticisms of the city's crime rates and threats to exert federal control. However, data shows that violent crime in D.C. has been declining, in line with a national trend, despite a previous post-pandemic surge.</p>

This follows similar, though less formal, arrangements with countries like Eswatini and South Sudan, which have also received deportees convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. These partnerships with African and Latin American nations, including Costa Rica and Panama, are a key part of the administration's strategy to handle recalcitrant countries.</p>

His appointment was notable as he is not an accountant by trade and had previously advocated for repealing parts of the tax code. The IRS has experienced leadership instability, with several interim commissioners serving since January.</p>

          <p>Amid a broad industry movement to phase out synthetic food dyes, the whitening agent titanium dioxide is largely being spared. While major food makers are removing numbered dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5 from products such as ice cream, titanium dioxide is often excluded from these pledges. The chemical, which makes foods appear whiter and colors more vibrant, faces scrutiny similar to other dyes, with the EU having banned it due to safety uncertainties. However, the U.S. food industry is reluctant to abandon it due to its effectiveness and the difficulty in finding a suitable replacement without affecting product cost, texture, and appearance.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated there will be "no invasion of Mexico" following reports that President Trump ordered the U.S. military to target drug cartels.

Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico was informed of the executive order, it does not permit U.S. military presence in its territory, stressing collaboration over intervention. The White House has not confirmed the directive but reiterated its priority of protecting the homeland by targeting these groups.</p>

Haddix, who ran a primate facility, had falsely claimed that Tonka, a chimpanzee actor from the film "Buddy," had died to avoid surrendering him to an animal sanctuary as ordered by a court. PETA had sued her over the poor conditions in which she kept several chimps.

          <p>Erin Patterson, recently convicted of murdering her in-laws with poisoned mushrooms, is now alleged to have also tried to poison her estranged husband on multiple occasions. Newly unsealed evidence reveals that Simon Patterson believes his wife was responsible for three separate incidents in 2021 and 2022 that left him severely ill and hospitalized. He testified that he declined the fatal lunch invitation because he feared she would poison him. Prosecutors had initially filed attempted murder charges related to these incidents but later dropped them before her trial for the mushroom-laced meal began.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed that the University of California system pay a $1 billion fine to settle federal accusations of antisemitism and restore over half a billion in frozen grant funding to UCLA. The proposal also demands sweeping changes to campus policies on protests, admissions, and diversity initiatives, and would require an outside monitor. UC President James B. Milliken stated that a payment of this magnitude would "completely devastate" the public university system. The demand follows similar, though smaller, settlements the administration reached with other universities like Columbia and Brown over civil rights violation allegations.</p>

          <p>New York City's medical examiner has identified the remains of three more victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, thanks to advances in DNA testing technology. The identified individuals are Ryan D. Fitzgerald, a 26-year-old currency trader, Barbara A. Keating, a 72-year-old passenger on American Airlines Flight 11, and a third woman whose name is being withheld. This ongoing effort provides a measure of closure to families, though approximately 1,100 victims from the World Trade Center attack remain unidentified. Officials reaffirmed their commitment to the mission of identifying every victim possible.</p>

          <p>Five years after the historic 2020 protests against President Alexander Lukashenko's rigged election, Belarus has seen a systematic erasure of the uprising and a deepening of authoritarian rule. The regime, with Russia's support, responded to the protests with a wave of violence and has since imprisoned thousands, including prominent activists like Maria Kolesnikova. Despite the repression, the regime has recently released a small number of political prisoners, signaling a potential willingness to use them as bargaining chips for concessions from the West. However, analysts believe the West has limited leverage to bring about significant change in the country.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire near Keratea, southeast of Athens, has resulted in the death of an elderly man found in his home and has forced the evacuation of thousands of residents. Fanned by strong winds, the blaze spread rapidly, destroying homes and burning through dry vegetation. This is one of over 50 fires to break out across Greece in a 24-hour period, marking one of the worst days for wildfires this summer. Another major fire has also erupted in western Greece near the historic site of Ancient Olympia, with authorities warning that the risk of further outbreaks remains severe across the country.</p>

          <p>Spain's national ombudsman is investigating a decision by the local government of Jumilla, a town in the Murcia region, to ban Muslim religious celebrations from public facilities like gyms and civic centers. The measure was passed by the conservative Popular Party with the support of the far-right Vox party, which framed it as a defense of "traditional values." The move has been condemned as "Islamophobic and discriminatory" by Muslim community leaders and Spain's Migration Minister. The ombudsman is seeking clarification on how the town will ensure the constitutional right to worship for all religious groups.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Bhim Kohli, an 80-year-old man killed by teenagers in Leicestershire, claims police "sat on information" that could have prevented his death. Two weeks before the fatal attack, Mr. Kohli witnessed two other boys racially assault another man in the same park and reported it. A police report reveals that while the perpetrators of the first assault were identified, they were not arrested until after Mr. Kohli was killed. The victim's daughter believes a swifter police response could have deterred the subsequent violence and has called for the police watchdog to review the case again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's latest sanctions package against Russia has created friction with India by targeting the import of petroleum products refined in India from discounted Russian crude. The EU sanctioned Nayara Energy, a major Indian refinery with Russian part-ownership, in an effort to cut funding for Russia's war in Ukraine. While this has caused some diplomatic tension, experts believe it is unlikely to derail a potential EU-India free trade agreement. They argue that the greater threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods may paradoxically push India to seek a more stable and predictable economic partnership with the EU.</p>

The relaunch is operated by The Brand House Collective (formerly Kirkland's Inc.), which acquired the license to develop stores after the original company went bankrupt in 2023. The new stores plan to honor the brand's legacy by accepting old 20% off coupons, regardless of their expiration date.

          <p>Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, launched a sharp, undiplomatic attack on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for criticizing Israel's decision to expand its military operations in Gaza. In a social media post, Huckabee provocatively compared the situation to World War II, asking if the UK dropped food on the Nazis and invoking the bombing of Dresden. He suggested that if Starmer had been prime minister then, the UK "would be speaking German." Huckabee's comments represent a blunt rebuke of a key ally's position on the conflict and go beyond the public stance of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is officially terminating its $7 billion "Solar for All" program, which was designed to help low-income communities access affordable solar energy. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the agency no longer has the statutory authority or funding for the program following the passage of new legislation. The program had already awarded grants to 60 recipients, including state agencies and tribal organizations, with the goal of benefiting 900,000 households. The move has been met with dismay by grant recipients, who warn that years of work will be lost and that it represents a "broken promise" to disadvantaged communities.</p>
