          <p>China's trademark office has rejected a trademark application for "GPT-5" filed by a subsidiary of US-based OpenAI. This decision represents a setback for the artificial intelligence firm's efforts to protect its branding in the highly competitive Chinese market. The rejection follows a similar denial by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in February 2024, which ruled that the terms "ChatGPT" and "GPT" were too descriptive to be trademarked. OpenAI is reportedly pending an appeal of the Chinese decision.</p>

          <p>A recent viral incident involving a CEO caught with a coworker at a concert has highlighted America's uniquely intense public condemnation of adultery. Cultural experts suggest this strong reaction is tied to the revered status of marriage as a moral pinnacle in the U.S., in contrast to some Western European countries where views on relationships are more varied. Despite this widespread moral disapproval, surveys indicate that infidelity is still common, creating a significant societal contradiction. The article explores this tension, noting how public judgment often softens for celebrities compared to ordinary individuals.</p>

          <p>The choice of Alaska for the upcoming summit between the US and Russian presidents highlights the state's deep historical ties to Russia. From 1799 to 1867, Alaska was a full-fledged Russian colony before being sold to the U.S. for $7.2 million to pay off debts from the Crimean War. This shared history provides a symbolic backdrop for the talks, which are set to address the current conflict in Ukraine, also involving Crimea. Some Russian figures are emphasizing this historical connection on social media ahead of the meeting.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not genuinely preparing to end the war, despite an upcoming peace summit with the U.S. in Alaska. Citing intelligence reports, Zelenskyy claimed that Russia is instead redeploying troops for new offensive operations and that Putin's goal is to frame the meeting as a personal victory. This statement comes as Ukrainian officials engage in a diplomatic push to ensure their key demands, such as territorial integrity and NATO ambitions, are central to any potential peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Alaska's governor has issued a state disaster declaration for the Juneau area due to the imminent threat of a catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood. Monitoring indicates that Suicide Basin, a part of the Mendenhall Glacier, has accumulated water levels exceeding those of previous record-breaking flood events, with a release expected at any moment. This marks the third consecutive year of serious glacier-related flooding for the state capital. Authorities have installed over two miles of flood control barriers to mitigate potential damage to the Mendenhall Valley.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their tariff truce, postponing significant rate hikes and allowing another 90 days for negotiations on major economic and security issues. The agreement keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods at 10%, averting a major escalation in the trade war. This extension is seen as a move to stabilize the economic situation and could pave the way for a leadership summit later this year. Analysts suggest the next steps will involve further official talks to resolve complex issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by UBS, global investors are increasingly turning to China's $25 trillion domestic bond market as they seek alternatives to U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This shift is part of a broader de-dollarization trend, with foreign holdings of yuan-denominated bonds rebounding since a low in March 2023. While still a small fraction of the total market, foreign investment is growing, supported by Chinese regulators simplifying investment procedures. Major global bond indices have also started incorporating Chinese bonds, further integrating the market into the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent pledge to remove homeless encampments from Washington, D.C., has sparked concern among advocacy groups due to a lack of clear details about the plan. Trump stated that the homeless "have to move out, IMMEDIATELY" and would be given places to stay "FAR from the Capital," but provided no specifics on relocation sites or resources. Advocates worry this approach could disconnect vulnerable individuals from essential services and support networks without addressing the root causes of homelessness. They argue that dismantling camps is counterproductive without sufficient affordable housing and support systems in place.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. and Russia prepare for a summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Moscow is not genuinely seeking peace and is instead preparing for new military offensives. With Ukraine not invited to the talks, there is significant concern in Kyiv and European capitals that a deal could be made at their expense. The European Union's foreign policy chief echoed this sentiment, stating Putin is "just pretending to negotiate" to postpone further sanctions. The situation highlights Ukraine's precarious position as it relies on Western support while being excluded from direct negotiations.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a press tent in Gaza City killed six Palestinian journalists, including Anas al-Sharif, a well-known correspondent for Al Jazeera. The Israeli military confirmed the strike, alleging that al-Sharif was a Hamas operative, a claim he had previously refuted and which journalist protection groups call unsubstantiated. Al Jazeera condemned the killing as a "desperate attempt to silence the voices" exposing events in Gaza. The Committee to Protect Journalists noted this is part of a pattern of lethal attacks on journalists covering the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this Friday, aiming to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump has described the meeting as a "feel out" session and suggested he will know quickly if a deal is possible, hinting that a "swapping of territories" could be involved. The exclusion of Ukraine from the direct talks has caused significant alarm in Kyiv and among European allies, who fear a deal could be struck that undermines Ukrainian sovereignty. Trump plans to consult with allies and Ukraine after the meeting.</p>

          <p>An American teen pilot and influencer, Ethan Guo, who was detained on a remote Antarctic island since June, has had all charges against him dropped. The 19-year-old was accused by Chilean authorities of illegally landing his plane in their territory and providing false flight plan information during a solo trip to raise money for cancer research. A judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chile for three years. Guo is now awaiting approval to depart the island and continue his mission.</p>

          <p>A severe and unusual frost in Turkey, the world's largest hazelnut producer, has devastated the crop and caused prices to jump by over 35% since April. This shortage is expected to significantly impact the global confectionery market, particularly for products like Nutella, which relies heavily on the nuts. Ferrero, the maker of Nutella, reportedly uses about a quarter of the world's hazelnut supply. The situation highlights the vulnerability of global food supply chains to climate change, as unpredictable weather events threaten key agricultural commodities and may force producers to raise consumer prices.</p>

In an interview with the BBC, she noted that the industry remains male-dominated despite its global growth. To address this, Tems has launched "The Leading Vibe Initiative," a platform designed to create opportunities and provide support for young women in Africa's music scene. She hopes the project will help change how women see themselves in music and make it easier for them to achieve success.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The announcement comes after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, blaming her for a weak July jobs report and claiming without evidence that numbers were faked. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been supported by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. The nomination has drawn criticism from some economists who argue Antoni is an unqualified partisan choice for the traditionally nonpartisan role.</p>

Harvey's mother stated that her son's name was "tarnished" during the trial while he could not defend himself, and therefore the defendant should also be named. The killer, also 15, was found guilty of murder, and a judge will decide on the anonymity order at the sentencing in October.

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in Singapore has stated the integrated resort will "be ready" for its next casino license renewal after receiving a truncated two-year license instead of the usual three. The shorter renewal was due to what Singapore's gambling authority called "unsatisfactory" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023. Despite the rebuke, CEO Lee Shi Ruh confirmed that RWS's S$6.8 billion expansion plans are proceeding, with a focus on transforming the resort into a premium lifestyle destination with new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium.</p>
