          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred a decision on President Trump's request to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her post, allowing her to remain in the role pending oral arguments scheduled for January. Trump has sought to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, in a case seen as a test of the Federal Reserve's political independence. The ruling ensures Cook will participate in upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meetings, potentially influencing decisions on interest rate cuts through the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Attorneys general from five states have sued Zillow and Redfin, accusing the real estate companies of violating antitrust laws by scheming to reduce competition in the online apartment rental market. The lawsuit, which follows a similar action by the FTC, centers on a deal where Zillow allegedly paid Redfin $100 million to shut down its competing rental advertising business and transfer clients. Officials argue this agreement harms consumers by potentially driving up advertising costs and limiting options for renters, while both companies maintain their partnership is pro-competitive.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has resulted in the furlough of over half of the National Park Service's 14,500 employees, with significant impacts on park operations. While open-air memorials, trails, and roads will generally remain accessible, parks that do not collect fees will have no visitor services, including restroom maintenance and trash collection. Parks that do collect fees will use that revenue to provide basic services, though conservation groups warn of potential damage and significant financial losses for both the parks and surrounding communities.</p>

          <h2>Record Electric Vehicle Demand Drives 8% Q3 Sales Growth for GM and Ford</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in their third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. The surge in EV sales, which more than doubled for GM, was partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive in September. Industry analysts expect overall EV sales to hit a record high for the quarter, though some auto executives anticipate a potential slowdown now that the federal incentive program has concluded.

          <p>In Woodbridge, England, a team of 180 volunteers is meticulously building a seaworthy replica of the 7th-century Anglo-Saxon longship discovered at the famous Sutton Hoo burial site. The project aims for historical accuracy, using traditional tools and methods from the era to reconstruct the 90-foot vessel believed to be the tomb of King Raedwald. Lacking original plans, the shipwrights are relying on the archaeological imprint of the ship, hand-selecting specific trees and crafting each component to revive a piece of ancient maritime history.</p>

          <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has temporarily suspended its operations in Gaza City and relocated staff due to the intensification of Israeli military operations. The move follows a similar suspension by Doctors Without Borders and comes as Israel warns residents to flee south, stating it is tightening its encirclement of the city. Meanwhile, German authorities arrested three suspected Hamas operatives for allegedly planning attacks on Jewish institutions in Germany, and an aid flotilla carrying activists is approaching Gaza despite Israeli naval presence.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Refinance Applications Drop 21% as Interest Rates Climb to Three-Week High</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sharp increase in mortgage rates to a three-week high caused a significant downturn in home loan applications, with total volume falling 12.7% last week. The decline was primarily driven by a 21% plunge in applications to refinance a home loan, as higher rates eliminated the financial incentive for many homeowners. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.46%, reversing a recent trend of lower rates and signaling that refinancing opportunities may be short-lived.

          <p>The Oktoberfest festival in Munich, Germany, was temporarily shut down and evacuated after police received a non-specific bomb threat linked to a fatal house fire elsewhere in the city. A 57-year-old man, suspected of starting the fire in a family dispute, was later found deceased with a backpack containing an apparent explosive device. After a thorough search of the festival grounds with explosives specialists and sniffer dogs yielded no threats, authorities reopened the popular event to the public on Wednesday evening.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old boy in Hartline, Washington, found a live World War II-era hand grenade in his family's front yard and brought it inside to his parents.

Technicians confirmed the device was live, safely removed it from the home, and disposed of it in a rural area. Authorities stated it is unknown how the corroded, decades-old grenade ended up in the yard or how long it had been there.</p>

          <p>The High Court has ordered PPE Medpro, a company connected to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband, to pay £122 million in damages for breaching a government contract during the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge ruled that the company failed to supply medical gowns that met the required standards for use by NHS workers, specifically by not proving they had undergone a validated sterilization process. The ruling comes after Baroness Mone admitted she stood to benefit from the contract and had lied about her involvement with the firm.</p>

          <p>U.S. private sector employment saw a surprising decline of 32,000 jobs in September, marking the largest drop since March 2023, according to the latest ADP National Employment Report.

The job losses were concentrated in small and mid-sized businesses, signaling a continued softening in hiring momentum that could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions.

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown, the first since 2018, could negatively impact the morale of federal employees focused on China policy and harm America's international image, according to analysts. The political impasse in Washington, which requires Democratic support to pass a funding bill in the Senate, projects an image of instability. A prolonged shutdown could also lead to significant workforce reductions within the government, potentially weakening the teams responsible for managing the complex and competitive relationship with Beijing at a critical time.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reportedly issued a new legal order asserting its right to demand access to the personal data of Apple's users within Britain, continuing a dispute over privacy and national security. This new instruction is believed to be a more targeted replacement for a previous order that sought access to Apple user data globally, which had drawn sharp criticism from the U.S. administration. While the government maintains it needs this access for national security with a proper warrant, Apple has consistently refused to compromise on user privacy or create backdoors into its systems.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attributed the increase in small boat crossings in the English Channel to Brexit, specifically blaming the UK's departure from EU agreements like the Dublin III regulation. This regulation had previously allowed the UK to return some asylum seekers to the first EU country they entered, a mechanism that no longer exists. While data shows the UK was a net sender of asylum seekers under the scheme before the 2016 referendum, migration experts note that leaving the EU and its fingerprint database has made it harder to track and return migrants.</p>

The decision comes after a 1-3 start to the season, during which the offense has struggled, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring. Gabriel, a third-round draft pick, will be the fifth different starting quarterback for the Browns in their last ten games, a move that is expected to renew questions about the future role of fifth-round pick Shedeur Sanders.</p>
