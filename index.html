          <p>Construction is progressing on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, with its first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. This new terminal, set to be JFK's largest, will replace the current one and is part of a wider $19 billion airport renovation. Designed with international travelers in mind, it will feature light-filled spaces, a consolidated layout for departures and customs, and advanced amenities like a microgrid for power resiliency. The project aims to modernize aging infrastructure and accommodate growing air traffic, aligning with major events like the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has generated significant controversy in the U.K. with a musical advertisement titled "Everything is Fine." The ad satirizes the country's economic challenges, including strikes and a cost-of-living crisis, prompting divided reactions from the public and business community. While some fintech and venture capital figures praised its message, others criticized it as a misleading and self-promotional attack on the U.K. government.

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly directed NASA to develop plans for terminating at least two crucial Earth-observing satellite missions, the Orbiting Carbon Observatories. These missions provide vital data on carbon dioxide levels and plant growth, used by scientists, farmers, and for national security assessments. Despite being fully functional and highly valued, the plans could lead to one satellite being intentionally destroyed in the atmosphere. The move has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats, who argue it illegally bypasses congressional funding authority and undermines critical climate and agricultural monitoring capabilities.</p>

Mulakhil is charged with sexual assault, while Kabir faces charges of kidnap, strangulation, and aiding the assault. The case has sparked political controversy after a local council leader alleged the men were asylum seekers and accused authorities of a cover-up, a claim the BBC could not verify. Police and the Home Office have declined to comment on the men's immigration status, citing national guidance during active legal proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a trade body for the UK car finance industry, has labeled the financial regulator's proposed redress scheme for mis-selling as "completely impractical." The primary concern is the scheme's retroactive scope, which could cover loans dating back to 2007, a period for which both firms and customers may lack necessary paperwork. While a Supreme Court ruling limited the scope of claims, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is still developing a compensation plan for cases with particularly large hidden commissions. The industry anticipates a total cost between £9 billion and £18 billion for the scheme. (not investment advice)</p>

Indian officials have remained noncommittal, stating their energy decisions are based on market prices and the global situation.

Despite the 2001 Abuja Declaration, where African Union members pledged to allocate 15% of their budgets to healthcare, most nations have failed to meet this target.

In contrast, Harris is reportedly facing donor fatigue and a lack of enthusiasm for another presidential bid.

Globally, the tariffs are creating what the IMF calls "persistent uncertainty," forcing countries to seek new markets and potentially sparking retaliatory protectionism.

          <p>Medical experts and sports scientists are advising that for most people, expensive electrolyte-infused sports drinks are unnecessary for maintaining hydration. While the body does lose electrolytes like sodium and potassium through sweat, a balanced diet typically provides more than enough to replenish them. The body, particularly the kidneys, is highly effective at regulating electrolyte levels, storing or excreting them as needed. While these drinks can be useful for elite athletes during prolonged, intense exercise or in cases of severe dehydration from illness, plain water and regular food are sufficient for the average person's daily hydration needs.</p>

Furthermore, Beijing's Cyberspace Administration has summoned Nvidia over national security concerns, signaling an intent to intervene in the local AI market. This complex dynamic illustrates the ongoing tech tensions and China's push for technological self-reliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Hostage Families in Israel Condemn Government's Reported Military Rescue Plans</h2>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have strongly criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported strategy to secure their release through a "decisive military victory." The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, representing most of the families, called the approach a "fraud" and an "illusion," stating it leads both Israel and the hostages toward devastation. This condemnation follows the release of harrowing videos by Hamas and Islamic Jihad showing hostages appearing emaciated. The families' plea for a negotiated solution contrasts sharply with the government's apparent focus on military action, deepening a painful public divide.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has agreed to significant concessions as part of a trade deal with the United States that will see Washington impose a lower-than-threatened 19% tariff. As part of the agreement, Malaysia will spend up to $150 billion over five years on equipment from U.S. companies for its semiconductor, aerospace, and data center industries. Additionally, state energy firm Petronas will purchase $3.4 billion in U.S. liquefied natural gas annually. The deal, which also includes Malaysian cross-border investments in the U.S., aims to address the trade imbalance between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's information technology sector is experiencing significant job losses, raising concerns about the industry's future. Tata Consultancy Services, the country's largest IT employer, recently announced it would cut over 12,000 jobs, citing skill mismatches and limited deployment opportunities. While slowing global demand is a factor, analysts point to the growing influence of artificial intelligence, which is automating routine tasks and transforming mid-level roles. This trend presents a major challenge for India's economy, which relies on the IT sector as a major employer and needs to create millions of new jobs annually.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic state legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by Donald Trump, would heavily favor the GOP and aims to protect the party's slim U.S. House majority ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democrats argue the plan is a gerrymandered power grab and are using the walkout as a last-ditch effort to block it. In response, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the lawmakers removed from office if they do not return by a set deadline.</p>

          <p>The search for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has entered its fourth day.

He initially escaped in a pickup truck, which was later found abandoned, and is now thought to have stolen another vehicle containing camping gear and clothing. The manhunt involves multiple local, state, and federal agencies, who are scouring the rugged, mountainous terrain where Brown has previously camped and hunted.</p>

While other major players like Li Auto and Nio also saw delivery drops, some rivals, including Xpeng, Xiaomi, and Leapmotor, recorded month-over-month growth. The results highlight the intense pressure on automakers as they navigate aggressive discounting strategies and fight for market share in the world's largest EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a major corruption case involving Singapore's former transport minister, Subramaniam Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping Iswaran cover up evidence related to expensive gifts, including a private jet trip, that Ong had provided during official business dealings. Due to Ong's poor health from a rare bone marrow cancer, prosecutors and his defense agreed on a fine instead of a potential seven-year jail term. The case has shocked Singapore, a country that prides itself on its low levels of corruption, partly justified by high salaries for public officials.</p>

These incidents complicate efforts to reintegrate Kurdish-controlled territories and maintain a tense truce in Sweida. The government, under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, has struggled to consolidate control and ease tensions with minority groups since ousting former President Bashar Assad in December.</p>

Authorities are now investigating the cause of the tremor, considering both natural seismic activity and potential mining-induced causes, and have launched a criminal probe to determine if any safety standards were violated.</p>
