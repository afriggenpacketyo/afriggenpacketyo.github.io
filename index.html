          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo spacecraft, on its maiden flight carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, experienced two premature engine shutdowns, forcing a delay in its planned rendezvous with the International Space Station. Flight controllers are now working to diagnose the problem and develop an alternative plan to safely guide the ship to the station. The Cygnus XL is a newly lengthened version of the spacecraft designed to carry more cargo per flight. The delay is a setback for the commercial resupply mission, but NASA has confirmed all other systems on the spacecraft are performing normally.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, has announced he will seek a rare third consecutive term in office. In his announcement, Walz highlighted his administration's progressive achievements, such as legalizing recreational marijuana and codifying abortion rights, while vowing to address gun violence and make healthcare more affordable. After his unsuccessful run for Vice President in 2024, Walz faces political headwinds, including polling that suggests half of Minnesotans oppose a third term and scrutiny over his administration's handling of a major COVID-19 fraud case.</p>

          <p>Former talk show host Ellen DeGeneres is being sued by a woman who alleges DeGeneres "t-boned" her vehicle at a four-way stop in Santa Barbara County in October 2023. The lawsuit claims DeGeneres was negligent, failed to stop at the stop sign, and caused the plaintiff serious personal injuries and financial damages. The legal action comes as DeGeneres faces renewed criticism regarding allegations of fostering a toxic work environment on her former show. DeGeneres and her wife have since moved to the U.K., citing President Trump's 2024 election victory as the reason.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second state visit, which will feature extensive royal ceremonies at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles. Alongside the pageantry, the visit has a significant economic focus, with major U.S. tech firms announcing over £31 billion in new UK investments, particularly in AI and quantum computing. While Trump emphasized his friendly relationship with the King, the UK government aims to reinforce the U.S. commitment to NATO and support for Ukraine during the diplomatic events.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic examines the irony of Charlie Kirk's allies using his murder to call for crackdowns on dissent, contrasting with Kirk's own career built on defending provocative speech. The article notes that while Kirk is being praised for his commitment to debate, his rhetoric was often abrasive and targeted marginalized groups. It highlights a tension within the MAGA movement, which once championed free speech as a tool against established norms but now, in power, appears to favor suppressing opposing viewpoints, a danger Kirk himself warned against.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley, were denied entry into Israel while on a parliamentary delegation to the occupied West Bank. The MPs, both doctors, intended to visit medical facilities and meet with humanitarian organizations to assess healthcare challenges in the region. The UK Foreign Office condemned the decision as "totally unacceptable," marking another instance of British parliamentarians being barred by Israeli authorities. The MPs stated they were stopped while crossing from Jordan and told they were not being admitted on "public order" grounds.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has rejected a request for a new trial for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989. The judge ruled that new evidence supporting their claims of sexual abuse by their father was not compelling enough to have changed the original verdict, as it did not negate the "premeditation and deliberation" of the killings. This decision, following their denial of parole in August, closes another potential avenue for the brothers' release, despite a recent surge in public support for their case.</p>

Originally rebuilt by Woolworths heiress Barbara Hutton, it was sold to the U.S. government for one dollar in 1946 and has since been a significant venue for strengthening the U.S.-U.K. "special relationship."</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous individuals, including a reporter, a university employee, and a Secret Service agent, have been fired or placed on leave for their public comments about the event. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for statements that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies. The incidents highlight the professional repercussions of speaking out on politically charged topics and the limited First Amendment protections for workers in the private sector.</p>

          <p>China Eastern Airlines is set to launch a new 25-hour flight route from Shanghai to Buenos Aires, which will be the longest in the carrier's network. The service, which will have one stop in Auckland, New Zealand, aims to significantly reduce travel time between China and Argentina by up to five hours. This new route reflects strengthening trade and political ties between China and Latin America. It offers a more direct connection by avoiding traditional layovers in the United States or Europe, with New Zealand waiving transit visas for Chinese nationals to facilitate the hub.</p>

          <p>President Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing it to December 16. The extension comes as a framework deal has been reached, which would see an investor consortium including Oracle and Silver Lake own approximately 80% of the U.S. business. The deal, which may require existing users to switch to a new app, was spurred by the threat of a U.S. ban. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the commercial terms have been largely finalized for months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While coronavirus levels in California's wastewater remain very high, there are emerging signs that the state's summer COVID-19 wave may be leveling off. Some key indicators, such as hospital admission rates, have seen slight declines statewide and in counties like Los Angeles. However, other metrics like test positivity have recently hit their highest point of the season, suggesting the peak may be near but has not definitively passed. Health officials note that overall hospitalizations remain low compared to previous surges, with older, under-immunized individuals being the most affected.</p>

This move continues a trend of appointing allies and critics to the panel, breaking with the past practice of vetting by agency officials.</p>
