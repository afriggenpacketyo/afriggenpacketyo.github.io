          <p>A Democratic congressional candidate, Isaiah Martin, was arrested after being forcibly removed from a Texas Capitol redistricting hearing. He was protesting what he described as a "rigged" process, accusing Republicans of gerrymandering districts to favor their party at Donald Trump's request. During his testimony, Martin refused to yield the floor, leading to a confrontation with authorities where he was dragged from the room while shouting. The charges against him were later dropped, and the incident highlights the intense political tensions surrounding the state's redistricting efforts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced plans to begin airdropping humanitarian aid and establishing corridors for UN convoys into Gaza, responding to increasing international pressure and reports of starvation. The move comes after months of restricted access and deadly incidents where Palestinians seeking food were killed. While allies like Jordan and the UAE are participating, aid organizations like the UN warn that airdrops are inefficient and cannot replace the need for full, safe land access. The announcement was made amid ongoing combat operations and a dire humanitarian situation for over two million displaced people.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard is monitoring a Chinese-flagged research icebreaker, the Xue Long 2, which was detected in the U.S. Arctic about 290 nautical miles north of Utqiagvik, Alaska. The vessel was located within the U.S. Extended Continental Shelf, an area where the U.S. has exclusive rights to resources. A long-range surveillance aircraft was dispatched to respond to the ship's presence. The incident is part of a pattern of increased foreign military and government vessel activity from China and Russia near Alaskan territory, prompting vigilant monitoring by U.S. and Canadian forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to shield pubs and music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, aiming to protect the cultural vibrancy of town centers. The reforms also intend to streamline the process for opening new bars in disused shops and encourage outdoor hospitality. This initiative comes in response to campaigns from several popular venues that faced closure threats and a general decline in the UK pub industry.</p>

          <p>A large-scale effort to recall 24 opposition lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, ensuring the China-friendly KMT party and its allies retain their majority in the legislature. Campaigners had accused the lawmakers of undermining national security and obstructing President William Lai's agenda since the 2024 elections. The opposition argues they are providing necessary checks and balances, not sabotaging the government. The result solidifies the political gridlock, forcing President Lai to navigate a hostile parliament for the foreseeable future amid rising pressure from Beijing.</p>

A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments in a case challenging his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court has already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, a decision that has been temporarily paused. Should the courts ultimately rule against the administration, it could invalidate nearly all of his major trade actions, including the worldwide "reciprocal" tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The report, which examined over 150 incidents between October 2023 and May 2024, concluded that in most cases of lost aid, the perpetrator could not be identified. These findings appear to challenge the Trump administration's and Israel's long-standing claims that Hamas regularly steals aid, a justification used for supporting the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

          <p>Arsenal has officially signed Sweden international striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting in a deal worth up to €73 million. The 27-year-old, who signed a five-year contract, was a prolific scorer in Portugal, with 97 goals in 102 matches for the club. Gyokeres stated that playing against Arsenal in the Champions League last season convinced him it was the right club for him. The signing is a major addition to Arsenal's squad and concludes a long-running transfer saga for the former Coventry City and Brighton player.</p>

          <p>A military-style grenade is unaccounted for following an explosion at a Los Angeles law enforcement training facility that killed three veteran deputy sheriffs. Sheriff Robert Luna stated the deputies were working on two seized grenades, which they believed to be inert, when one detonated. Despite extensive searches of the blast area and related vehicles, the second device has not been found. The incident, which is the department's largest single loss of life since 1857, has prompted an independent review of the bomb squad's policies.</p>

          <p>An advertising campaign for American Eagle featuring actress Sydney Sweeney is being credited with a notable rise in the clothing brand's stock price. This article suggests the campaign's success stems from its return to a more traditional advertising approach that emphasizes the model's visual appeal to sell a product. This contrasts with a recent trend of "social messaging" ads that have often proven ineffective. The market's positive reaction indicates investors may be rewarding the company for prioritizing a profit-focused strategy over ideological messaging. (not investment advice)</p>
