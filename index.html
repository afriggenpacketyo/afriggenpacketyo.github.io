        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is facing a potential deflationary spiral as it redirects exports, originally intended for the U.S. market, to its domestic market due to high tariffs. This move is supported by local governments and major businesses like JD.com and Tencent, who are promoting the sale of these goods to Chinese consumers. However, economists warn that this influx of discounted goods could trigger a price war among Chinese firms, eroding profitability and impacting employment. Consequently, weak consumer demand and uncertain job prospects may lead to a decline in both consumer and producer price indices, exacerbating deflationary pressures across the economy.

          <p>Silent book clubs are experiencing a surge in popularity, offering a unique social experience centered around reading in a shared space.

The trend, which originated in San Francisco in 2012, has grown to over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries, indicating a resurgence in people seeking social activities that don't revolve around drinking or dating.</p>

          <p>Experts are debating the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on workplace inequality, with some fearing it could exacerbate existing disparities. While AI can increase productivity, there's concern it may displace workers and widen the gap between nations. Some workplace leaders suggest adapting employment strategies rather than trying to prevent job losses, focusing on upskilling employees and creating new roles. Additionally, ethical considerations surrounding bias in AI are being discussed, as AI systems can amplify existing biases present in human-generated data. The Microsoft Trend Index indicates that many leaders plan to expand workforce capacity using AI, while also considering headcount reductions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States, claiming the American film industry is declining due to foreign incentives. He argues this is a national security threat and a concerted effort by other nations to undermine Hollywood. This move would mark the first time a Trump tariff is applied to services rather than manufactured goods.

          <p>A shooting at Featherly Regional Park in Yorba Linda, California, resulted in three people being hospitalized. The incident stemmed from an earlier altercation, after which a man returned to the park and attempted to run someone over with his car. He then exited the vehicle and shot two people before turning the gun on himself. All three gunshot victims were transported to the hospital, while the person hit by the car sustained minor injuries. Authorities believe all parties involved knew each other, and are treating the incident as isolated.</p>

It suggests that investing in social care could stimulate economic growth, creating jobs and generating returns to the wider economy. The committee calls for improved data collection and annual assessments of unmet care needs, stressing that social care is integral to NHS reforms.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption crackdown within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. The campaign's impact on war readiness and modernization is considered limited, with internal competition among Xi's supporters potentially driving the investigations. Recent targets include members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), indicating a focus on rooting out corruption at the highest levels of the military.</p>

Chemical compounds are carefully mixed to ensure a clear signal, with black smoke indicating no decision and white smoke signaling the election of a new pope. This tradition, despite modern communication advances, symbolizes continuity and secrecy while allowing the public to feel included in the process.</p>

Oil prices plunged after OPEC+ agreed to raise production. U.S. futures also edged down, reversing gains from the previous week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the former prison on an island off the coast of California. He stated that the prison would house America's most ruthless and violent offenders, serving as a symbol of law, order, and justice. Alcatraz was originally a naval defense fort and later became a military prison before housing convicts from the federal prison system. The prison closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, and the island currently operates as a tourist site.</p>

The article concludes that President Trump has been back in power for only three months, but already his policies, including imposing tariffs and upending alliances, have rippled into domestic political battles around the world.</p>
