          <p>Southwest Airlines is implementing a new policy on January 27, mandating that plus-sized passengers who do not fit between armrests must purchase an extra seat in advance, with the option for a refund becoming less certain. This significant change, introduced alongside the carrier's shift to assigned seating, marks a notable departure from its previous, more flexible accommodations for larger travelers. Critics, including travel agents and long-standing customers, contend that this policy will negatively impact the flying experience for many, potentially eroding customer loyalty and the airline's unique brand identity. The airline, facing pressure from activist investors to enhance profitability, has recently made other controversial changes, such as ending its long-standing "bags fly free" perk.</p>

This highly anticipated annual event is widely expected to be the platform for unveiling the latest iPhone model, presumably the iPhone 17, along with potential updates to the Apple Watch lineup. Continuing its practice since 2020, the event will be presented as a pre-recorded video streamed on Apple's website, rather than a live stage demonstration.

          <p>President Donald Trump's unprecedented attempt to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook "for cause," citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, is widely expected to culminate in a Supreme Court challenge. Cook and her legal team assert that Trump lacks the statutory authority for such a dismissal, arguing that no legitimate cause exists and that the alleged misdeeds occurred prior to her appointment. Legal and economic analysts warn that this case could profoundly impact the Federal Reserve's crucial independence, potentially setting a significant precedent for presidential influence over the central bank. An initial injunction is anticipated to preserve Cook's position until the Supreme Court delivers a definitive ruling on the matter.</p>

          <p>Dresden police and prosecutors have arrested a 21-year-old Syrian national in connection with a knife attack on a late-night tram over the weekend, which resulted in injuries to a young American citizen. The suspect, initially detained and released, was re-arrested after new information provided reasonable grounds to suspect his direct involvement in injuring the victim with a dangerous object. The American man was wounded after bravely intervening to protect another female passenger who was being harassed. The U.S. Embassy in Berlin has strongly condemned the "brutal attack," urging German authorities to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure maximum punishment under the law.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from office is seen by experts as an unprecedented and serious threat to the Fed's independence, a cornerstone of the US economic system.

Legal challenges are expected, with the outcome potentially signaling the end of central bank autonomy in the US. Such political interference could destabilize financial markets, weaken the US dollar, and set a concerning global precedent, drawing comparisons to Turkey's economic struggles under similar interventions.

          <p>Reform UK has announced "Operation Restoring Justice," an ambitious immigration plan proposing the deportation of 500,000-600,000 migrants over five years if the party comes to power. Leader Nigel Farage stated that all individuals arriving in the UK via small boats would be immediately detained and denied asylum claims. The plan includes allocating £2 billion to incentivize countries like Afghanistan to accept returnees, with potential sanctions for non-cooperation. This policy would necessitate building new detention centers and exiting international treaties like the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. Opponents from other political parties have labeled the proposals as unworkable and legally problematic.</p>

          <p>Pressure is mounting on the European Union to deploy its "trade bazooka" in retaliation against US President Donald Trump's threats of imposing tariffs and export restrictions on nations that enforce digital laws and taxes on American technology companies. Trump's social media posts, though not explicitly naming Europe, target the bloc's digital services and markets acts, which aim to safeguard online users and prevent tech monopolies. Reports also suggest the US is considering visa restrictions on EU officials involved in these digital policies. This aggressive stance emerges shortly after the EU and US agreed on a trade deal, where the European side reportedly held firm against demands to dilute its digital regulations.</p>

The judge, Thomas Cullen, criticized the Trump administration's "unprecedented and unfortunate" efforts to "smear and impugn" judges. Cullen concluded that the lawsuit represented a nonjusticiable dispute between co-equal branches of government and that the judges were "absolutely immune" from such a suit, advising the Executive to find a proper way to raise concerns.</p>

The optimal choice for an individual hinges on their specific financial circumstances, such as credit score, income stability, available home equity, and their desired debt repayment timeline.

          <p>Mortgage experts are forecasting a potential downward trend in mortgage interest rates for fall 2025, with some anticipating rates to approach the 6% threshold by the end of the year. Although a Federal Reserve rate cut in September might not immediately translate into significant mortgage rate reductions, subsequent cuts could lead to more noticeable declines. It's important to note that mortgage rates are also influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield and do not always directly follow Fed decisions. A substantial drop in rates could attract a surge of homebuyers who have been waiting on the sidelines, potentially leading to increased competition and higher home prices.

A key feature is a temporary $6,000 tax break for older Americans, which doubles to $12,000 for married couples, further lowering their adjusted gross income.

          <p>A man named Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker from Ethiopia, is facing charges of sexual assault, inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, and harassment without violence in Epping, Essex. He allegedly propositioned two 14-year-old girls, telling them he "wanted to have a baby with them" and attempting to kiss them, then later placing his hand on one girl's thigh. The incident, which Kebatu denies, has sparked anti-immigration protests. The court heard the girls' testimonies describing their shock and discomfort, with one stating he "kept leaning in, pouting his lips" and made them feel "sick to my stomach."</p>

          <p>Two police officers were tragically killed and another seriously wounded in a shooting at a rural property in Porepunkah, Victoria, Australia, sparking an extensive manhunt for the heavily armed perpetrator.

Australian media identified the alleged gunman as Dezi Freeman, characterized as a radicalized conspiracy theorist known for his anti-police sentiments. This devastating incident has led to community lockdowns, including schools and public buildings, and a massive police operation, underscoring the profound impact of such rare violence in Australia.</p>

          <p>Great Britain's Ben Turner, riding for Ineos Grenadiers, achieved a significant milestone by securing his maiden Grand Tour stage victory at the Vuelta a España. Turner, who was a late addition to the team due to illness, delivered a powerful sprint finish to win the fourth stage, outmaneuvering Belgian competitors Jasper Philipsen and Edward Planckaert. This 206km stage, the longest of this year's race and the final one outside Spain, featured over 3,000 meters of altitude, with an early breakaway eventually being caught by the main peloton. Turner's emotional win marks a highlight in his professional career, while France's David Gaudu claimed the overall lead.</p>

          <p>U.S. companies are significantly increasing their "frontloading" of Chinese imports, bringing in goods ahead of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, a strategy reminiscent of the 2018 trade war but on a larger scale. Data indicates that in 2025, shippers imported more than double the percentage of Chinese exports compared to 2018's peak. This surge in imports, particularly notable between June and July after a temporary tariff reduction, is now showing signs of decline in ocean freight bookings and spot rates. This pattern suggests companies are adapting to trade tensions by pulling forward demand, leading to potential future drops in imports. (not investment advice)</p>

Hume argued that the order disregards a 1989 Supreme Court ruling which affirmed flag burning as legitimate political expression protected by the First Amendment. Vice President JD Vance defended the order, while Trump stated it would impose a one-year jail sentence and called for the Attorney General to challenge the Supreme Court's precedent. Critics, including Hume, highlighted the order's conflict with established constitutional law, even referencing conservative Justice Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in the original ruling.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued its fall 2025 seasonal outlook, forecasting a warmer-than-average autumn for most of the United States, with the highest probabilities in the Southwest and New England. This projection suggests milder conditions than typically expected from September through November, continuing a historical trend of warming falls observed since the early 1900s. A warmer autumn can lead to several impacts, including prolonged summer-like heat, increased cooling demand and costs, extended growing and allergy seasons, and heightened wildfire risks, particularly in the Western states. This forecast is significantly influenced by an expected shift towards a cooler La Niña pattern in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

Prosecutors state his motive was "excessive religious motivation," intending to kill Germans indiscriminately in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries. This February attack, which took place shortly before a German general election, significantly fueled debates on tougher migration policies and contributed to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party achieving its best-ever electoral result.</p>
