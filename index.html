        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits exceeding expectations, driven by strong growth in wealth management, global markets, and global banking. The bank's profit before taxation rose to $2.103 billion, a notable increase from the previous year. While the Wealth Solutions division was a standout performer with a 28% rise in operating income, the bank also booked a $219 million credit impairment charge due to rising rates impacting repayments. Despite trade tariff complexities, Standard Chartered maintains its guidance for operating income growth between 2023 and 2026 and continues its cost-saving initiative, 'Fit for Growth'.

          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has taken on an unprecedented four government positions, including Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist for the National Archives, and Interim National Security Advisor. This move raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage these diverse roles, especially under President Trump's unconventional leadership style. While precedents exist for officials holding multiple positions, the breadth of Rubio's responsibilities sparks concerns about potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding the archivist's role in overseeing record preservation across federal agencies. The article highlights the close relationship between Rubio and Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, as a key factor in his appointment to these positions.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling the party's rising influence in British politics. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, won by a mere six votes over her Labour Party opponent in Runcorn and Helsby. This win could indicate a broader shift towards a more polarized, multi-party system in the U.K., potentially challenging the dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. The article notes that this victory serves as a setback for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party, particularly after their recent rise to power.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a move with potentially significant socio-economic and political consequences. This decision, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, demonstrates the government's commitment to societal values. The census is likely to lead to demands for increased quotas in government jobs and college admissions for lower and intermediate castes, known as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The inclusion of caste details comes ahead of a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a key issue, and amid pressure from opposition parties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed American shoppers to purchase cheap goods from China without tariffs.

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed the "de minimis" exemption, a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, which will likely increase prices for US customers of firms like Shein and Temu. The loophole allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to US customers without paying duties or taxes. Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, argued that it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods. Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee.</p>

Despite military convoys and warnings of conflict, many Pakistanis are more concerned about everyday struggles and an uncertain future.
