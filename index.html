          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon has endorsed Columbia University's over $200 million settlement with the Trump administration as a "template" for other universities. The agreement addresses campus antisemitism, which McMahon stated Columbia knew was a problem, and also includes measures to combat discriminatory hiring and improve safety. The settlement mandates that Columbia enforce strict rules against disruptive and masked protests, maintain trained security, and cooperate with the NYPD. McMahon emphasized the strong accountability measures, warning that consequences for violations will include suspensions, expulsions, and potential jail time for criminal activity.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, known as the "doomsday mom," was sentenced in Arizona to two consecutive life terms for conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and attempting to murder her niece's ex-husband. This sentencing follows her existing life sentences in Idaho for murdering her two children, whom she and her husband believed were zombies. Prosecutors argued her motives were money and a desire to be with her new husband, using "twisted" religious beliefs as justification. During the hearing, victims' family members delivered emotional impact statements, describing her as a "monster" and the true "family tragedy."</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has joined the list of the 20 most valuable companies in the United States, with its market capitalization reaching $375 billion. The company's stock has more than doubled in 2025, driven by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence business and strong ties to the U.S. government. In its last quarter, Palantir's U.S. government revenue grew by 45%, contributing to a 39% rise in total sales. Despite its rapid growth, the company trades at a high valuation of 273 times forward earnings, reflecting significant investor confidence in its future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel's stock fell over 8% after the company announced it was cutting costs in its foundry division and might discontinue the business if it fails to secure a major customer for its next-generation technology. This decline overshadowed an otherwise positive earnings report that beat revenue estimates. CEO Lip-Bu Tan acknowledged that the company had "invested too much, too soon" and is now canceling chip facility projects in Europe and slowing production in Ohio. The move highlights Intel's ongoing struggles to compete in the AI market and the uncertainty surrounding its chip manufacturing strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated that a new trade deal with Canada may not be achievable, suggesting that imposing tariffs might be the alternative to negotiations.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated his country will not be rushed into a "bad deal."

Amid mounting international pressure, Israel, which controls aid entry, has indicated it may allow airdrops, a method aid agencies consider inefficient.

Drawing a parallel to George Orwell's analysis of crude postcards, the piece suggests that such reactions are a healthy recognition of relatable human fallibility rather than a sign of moral superiority or societal decay.

Experts note that such a rebate would likely require Congressional approval and could be challenging to implement.

          <p>"Diciannove (Nineteen)," a new Italian film from director Giovanni Tortorici and produced by Luca Guadagnino, is reviewed as a vibrant and formally playful coming-of-age story. The film follows Leonardo, a pretentious literature student in Siena, as he navigates his 19th year, torn between his love for classical authors and the messy realities of modern life. The review praises the lead performance by Manfredi Marini and the film's energetic, stylish filmmaking, which captures the chaotic and solipsistic nature of youth. While occasionally tiring in its restlessness, the movie is lauded for its wit and its honest portrayal of a young man's search for self.</p>

The meetings took place in Tallahassee, Florida, where she is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The Justice Department has not indicated what it learned, but stated it would share information at an "appropriate time."</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe died by suicide, noting there were "shortcomings" in the mental health care he received in the months prior. Thorpe, 55, died after being struck by a train in August 2024. The court heard that Thorpe had spiraled into depression after losing his coaching job and that his wife had informed his care team he was asking for "help to end his life" weeks before his death. The coroner stated that despite these warnings, Thorpe was not perceived to be in a crisis situation and had not been seen in person by healthcare professionals for months.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's role at the southern border has significantly expanded under a Donald Trump emergency declaration, with troop deployments tripling to 7,600. Soldiers are now working closely with Border Patrol in high-traffic areas and have been empowered to apprehend individuals in newly designated militarized zones, a move that critics say blurs the line with civilian law enforcement. The mission, led from a new command center in Arizona, utilizes armored vehicles, helicopters, and drones to deter illegal crossings. This increased militarization is occurring even as the rate of apprehensions at the border has fallen to a 60-year low.</p>

          <p>The new Marvel movie, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," is reviewed as a visually handsome and well-acted film that unfortunately lacks the charm and fun of its source material. Directed by Matt Shakman, the movie quickly moves past the team's origins and family dynamic, diving straight into a high-stakes, apocalyptic plot involving the planet-eating villain Galactus. The review argues that this focus on constant, world-ending menace flattens the characters, played by Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. While the action sequences are impressive, the film is criticized for its overly serious tone and for missing the playful, bickering chemistry that defines the team.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical account of how Adolf Hitler, in his first weeks as chancellor in 1933, systematically undermined the authority of Germany's independent central bank, the Reichsbank. Its fiscally conservative president, Hans Luther, initially resisted Nazi pressure, even forcing the removal of a swastika flag from the bank's building. However, Hitler, needing funds for his massive rearmament program, bypassed legal channels and used threats to force Luther's resignation. He then replaced Luther with the more compliant Hjalmar Schacht, who assured Hitler the bank would provide whatever funds were needed, effectively ending its independence.</p>

To expedite the process, homeowners should choose lenders known for speed, such as online providers or credit unions, and have all necessary financial documents prepared in advance. Asking for digital or drive-by appraisals and being highly responsive to lender requests can also significantly shave time off the approval and funding timeline.</p>
