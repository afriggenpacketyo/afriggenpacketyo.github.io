            <h2>Evangelical Leaders Combat Misinformation, Reclaim 'Christ is King' Phrase</h2>

            <p>Evangelical leaders are actively working to reclaim the phrase "Christ is King" from extremist groups on both the far-right and far-left who are attempting to distort its original meaning. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) has been monitoring the online hijacking of the phrase, noting its misuse by figures like Nick Fuentes to promote divisive agendas, with evidence suggesting bot activity amplified the antisemitic rhetoric. Evangelical leaders assert the phrase is a Christian expression of worship and should not be used to spread hate, emphasizing the importance of unity between Christians and Jews, and that the Christian bloc is a force to be reckoned with.</p>

            <p>Recent video footage reveals the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducting joint sea drills involving helicopter crews, indicating enhanced cross-unit coordination and coastal support capabilities essential for potential conflicts around Taiwan. The drills, featuring pilots from the 81st Group Army, highlight the challenges of low-level flights and simulated combat conditions at sea. Experts note the drills as surprising due to the involvement of an infantry-based unit in naval exercises, which is an indicator of the PLA's evolving strategies and readiness in the region.</p>

            <p>As retirement approaches, it is essential to protect savings from market volatility, such as that caused by tariffs, through rebalancing investment portfolios and building cash reserves. Financial planners recommend shifting assets towards a 60/40 investment portfolio, which typically includes 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and maintaining two years of income in cash to mitigate sequence of returns risk. Considering a bond ladder is also advised to protect against early losses by allowing retirees to tap cash reserves while their portfolio recovers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amid market uncertainty, top Wall Street analysts are highlighting dividend-paying energy stocks as a way to steady investment portfolios. Energy Transfer (ET), with a 7.5% dividend yield, is favored for its diversified assets and potential gains from Waha price spreads. The Williams Companies (WMB), offering a 3.4% dividend yield, is also recommended for its natural gas-focused operations and growth opportunities in AI/data centers. These stocks are seen as capable of generating solid cash flows and withstanding short-term challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As the trade war between the US and China escalates, China should consider requiring bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi as a countermeasure, which would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. China's strong manufacturing capabilities enable it to competitively produce cost-effective products, supporting considerable trade volume with the US. This would signal to hesitant global investors that China’s economic fundamentals are strong, encouraging them to increase their holdings of renminbi assets.</p>

            <p>Amy Woolard's poem, '1994,' explores themes of mixing, loss, and belonging through vivid imagery and sensory details. The poem contemplates the human capacity to combine disparate elements, from alcohol and sugar to sweat and memories, while also acknowledging the inevitability of death and the persistence of nature. It reflects on the search for solace and connection, the shared experiences that bind people together, and the bittersweet realization that the music of each generation feels uniquely their own.</p>
