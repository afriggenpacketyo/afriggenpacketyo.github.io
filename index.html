          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. James Butterfill of CoinShares noted that broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Recent regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act, and a pro-crypto agenda from U.S. leaders, including JPMorgan's acceptance of Bitcoin for clients, further supported the market's rise. Bitcoin's divergence from traditional equity markets suggests investors are seeking alternative stores of value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House voted to begin debating Republicans' sweeping domestic policy bill, also known as the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' after Speaker Mike Johnson made several changes to appease Republican holdouts. These changes included speeding up Medicaid work requirements, increasing the state and local tax deduction, expanding clean energy tax credit rollbacks, and providing additional funds for immigration enforcement. Democrats have denounced the bill as harmful to social programs, while some Republicans remain dissatisfied, creating uncertainty about its passage. The legislation is projected to cause around 10 million Americans to become uninsured and add trillions to the national debt.</p>

          <p>Russia's economy, heavily focused on supporting its war efforts in Ukraine, is showing signs of strain due to international sanctions and domestic pressures. Despite appearing reluctant to negotiate peace, Russia faces increasing economic and military challenges, including dwindling stockpiles of Soviet-era military equipment and the need for further forced mobilization. The Russian central bank is maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation, but a slowdown in GDP growth has surprised economists. Tighter sanctions on Russia's 'shadow fleet' and declining oil prices are further exacerbating the country's economic difficulties.</p>

          <p>Government borrowing in the UK was higher than expected in April, reaching Â£20.2 billion, an increase of Â£1 billion compared to April of the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of Â£17.9 billion. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. The increased borrowing reflects the difference between government spending and tax income during the month.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering releasing violent offenders, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving only a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. An Independent Sentencing Review recommends managing more offenders in the community and expanding a chemical castration pilot program for sex offenders. The government aims to construct three new prisons by the end of 2025, allocating Â£4.7bn for prison-building between 2026 and 2031. Critics express concern about the potential strain on the probation service and the impact on victims of violent crime.</p>

Despite evidence to the contrary, Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with the claims during an Oval Office meeting.

          <p>One year after Labour's general election victory, the government is attempting to highlight its achievements while blaming the Conservatives for ongoing challenges. Examples include the handover of the Chagos Islands and the sentencing review, both of which Labour attributes to Conservative failures. The government is also exploring mandatory chemical castration for sex offenders and releasing new data on migration and public sector pay. This strategy raises questions about the diminishing returns of blaming the previous administration as Labour approaches its first anniversary in office.</p>

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking California's vehicle emissions waivers, a move Democrats criticize as a 'nuclear option' that could set a dangerous precedent. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and bypasses the filibuster. California officials have vowed to sue the federal government if the waivers are revoked, which could impact cities and states adopting California's vehicle standards. The auto industry supports revoking the waivers, while environmental groups warn it would undermine California's ability to address pollution.</p>

Kim attributed the accident to 'absolute carelessness, irresponsibility, and unscientific empiricism' and warned of consequences at a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party.
