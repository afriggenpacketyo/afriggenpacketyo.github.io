          <p>A 61-year-old woman was fatally attacked by an alligator while canoeing with her husband on Lake Kissimmee in central Florida. According to officials, the alligator thrashed and tipped the canoe over, causing both individuals to fall into the water, and the woman ended up on top of the alligator and was bitten. The husband attempted to fight off the alligator, but was unsuccessful in his efforts to save his wife. Nuisance alligator trappers were called to the scene and recovered two alligators, one matching the description of the one involved in the attack. Alligator attacks causing serious injuries are rare in Florida.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to a combination of equipment malfunctions and air traffic control staffing shortages. These issues, which began with system outages causing controllers' screens to go dark, have been exacerbated by runway construction. The FAA has blamed equipment outages and staffing levels in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center that oversees Newark's airspace is based, as well as runway construction. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule, and lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the FAA. The Secretary of Transportation said that he will soon release details of a new plan to revamp the decades-old air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain its current interest rate levels, remaining between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent, due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs could trigger inflation while simultaneously hindering economic growth. Fed officials are closely monitoring economic data for signs of rising consumer prices or a weakening labor market. The central bank is in a wait-and-see mode, seeking clarity on the economic implications of Trump's policies, including tariffs, spending cuts, and deportations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to address questions about the Fed's approach to managing inflation and avoiding policy errors given these uncertainties.</p>

He criticized Trump's actions, including a combative meeting with Ukraine's President Zelensky and calls to rename the Gulf of Mexico.

          <p>Congressional Republicans are attempting to mitigate the economic fallout from President Trump's tariffs through a spending and tax cut package, primarily extending the 2017 tax law. However, many Republicans doubt that this will offset the damage caused by the tariffs. Trump's promotion of the tax law extension as tax cuts "for everybody" is misleading, as it merely preserves existing rates. The political problem is there is little new here for voters, and it may seem like thin gruel to voters.</p>

          <p>The long-postponed Real ID enforcement began at airports, with many fliers arriving early or bringing passports, leading to a smooth rollout. Travelers are now required to show a federally compliant Real ID, passport, or other approved identification to board domestic flights. Those without Real IDs received warnings and underwent additional screening. Despite warnings and postponed deadlines, many travelers remain unaware of the requirements. Several travelers said they were more concerned over the news that the air traffic controllers who coordinate planes at Newark had briefly lost contact with planes last week, prompting some of the controllers to take trauma leave from work.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the rise of a particular style among Republican women in the Trump administration, characterized by hyperfemininity and overt Christianity, which contrasts with their often aggressive language. The women's hair is in Utah curls, long waves with straight ends, popularized by Mormon momfluencers. Their makeup is heavy; the content creator and comedian Suzanne Lambert called it “Republican makeup,” which she explained is “matte and flat”: thick eyebrows and lashes, dark eyeliner on the top and bottom lids, a bold lip, lots of bronzer. The article suggests that this style is designed to go viral on social media, and that it is a form of female power that is acceptable within conservative communities because it does not threaten the status quo.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a review into what it describes as “recent incidents of antisemitic violence” at the University of Washington and its affiliates following a pro-Palestinian protest there on Monday that led to about 30 arrests. The review is part of a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses under the Trump administration. In recent months, the education department’s civil rights office has warned 60 colleges and universities that they may face “enforcement actions” over alleged failure to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism, and the administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding to schools that permit what it deems “illegal protests”.</p>
