        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Susan Monarez, CDC Director, was reportedly ousted less than a month after Senate confirmation, sparking a legal dispute as her attorneys argue only President Trump can fire her. The removal and subsequent resignations of other senior officials are linked to disagreements with the Trump administration over vaccine policy, budget cuts, and the "weaponization of public health." Monarez had previously refuted discredited theories linking vaccines to autism, asserting their life-saving importance. This upheaval follows a tumultuous period for the agency, including a shooting incident and halted mRNA vaccine research contracts.</p>

          <p>Beijing has accused the Philippines of "courting outside powers" and "causing trouble" in the South China Sea, using an idiom to suggest Manila is jeopardizing regional security. A Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesperson stated that the Philippines undermines stability by inviting external influence, a veiled reference to the US. China asserted its actions to safeguard territorial sovereignty are justified and vowed firm countermeasures against any provocative behavior. This statement highlights escalating tensions and ongoing disputes in the strategically important maritime region.</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings forecasts for its recent quarter, yet held firm on its full-year guidance due to uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts. The consumer electronics retailer reported a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, its highest growth in three years, driven by mobile phones and gaming. Despite this recovery, challenges like higher interest rates affecting appliance sales and consumer hesitation on big-ticket items persist. The company's CFO emphasized prudence given the tariff outlook, which could affect both consumers and the business in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A $1.2 billion contract to build and operate a large immigration detention complex at Fort Bliss, Texas, has raised questions due to its award to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small firm with no listed experience in corrections. The Pentagon has withheld contract details, prompting a complaint from a competing bidder and concerns from a member of Congress about the firm's inexperience. This secretive process reflects the administration's rapid push for mass migrant detention and deportation, with the facility drawing comparisons to a previously criticized Florida camp. Advocates warn of potential abuse and neglect due to limited oversight.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair participated in a White House meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss plans for post-war Gaza, alongside Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Witkoff indicated a "very comprehensive" plan is being developed, reflecting Trump's humanitarian motives, though details remain undisclosed. The meeting occurred as Israeli forces continued operations in Gaza, with warnings of an "inevitable" evacuation of Gaza City, where famine has been declared. The UN Security Council, excluding the US, has called the famine "man-made" and urged Israel to lift aid restrictions.</p>

Medvedev reacted angrily, repeatedly smashing his racket and insulting the official, causing a six-minute delay.

The movie's characters explore nonmonogamy, highlighting the constant human desire for what they lack and the struggle with inherent limitations in relationships.

          <p>Botswana has achieved an extraordinary 98% reduction in childhood HIV infection rates since the 1990s, transforming from a nation "at risk of extinction" due to the virus. Once, one in eight infants were infected at birth, but new infections are now exceedingly rare, prompting audits for every diagnosed case. This success is attributed to sustained public investments in HIV prevention infrastructure, widespread free antiretroviral therapies since 2002, and comprehensive maternal care programs. Botswana is the first high-HIV-rate country to achieve the WHO's Gold Tier for eliminating mother-to-child transmissions.</p>

Barristers contend the injunction jeopardizes the asylum accommodation program and overlooks potential hardship for those displaced.

More experienced workers, possessing tacit knowledge and soft skills, are less affected. While AI is creating new jobs and augmenting human work in some areas, the research suggests a substantial "rearrangement of employment" is underway, emphasizing the need for young workers to adapt and leverage AI tools.

A committee report found students prioritize extracurriculars over academics, yet experience increased stress due to the lack of meaningful differentiation from high grades. Professors face pressure to raise grades, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic. Harvard is now implementing measures to standardize grading, enforce attendance, and encourage a renewed focus on intellectual pursuits, aiming to restore the value of academic achievement and fairness in evaluation.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is profoundly impacting education, presenting challenges like student cheating but also significant opportunities for teachers. A Gallup survey found 60% of teachers use AI, with weekly users saving an estimated six hours, potentially allowing more direct student interaction. While concerns about AI cheating persist, many educators are shifting from banning to leveraging these tools for lesson planning and administrative tasks. The article explores the evolving role of AI, its potential for personalized tutoring, and the ongoing debate over its efficacy and equitable access in schools.</p>

          <p>Mexican senators engaged in a physical altercation during a heated debate concerning alleged opposition calls for US military intervention against drug cartels. Lawmaker Alejandro Moreno confronted Senate president Gerardo Fernandez Norona, pushing and slapping him. The brawl followed accusations that opposition parties advocated for US military action, a claim they deny. This incident occurs as President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to use military force against Latin American drug cartels, a move Mexico has firmly rejected. Both senators involved are also facing separate controversies.</p>

Observers suggest Kim is emboldened by expanding cooperation with Russia, which provides economic and military aid in exchange for support in the Ukraine war.

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, which currently require properties to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower non-domestic rates. The new proposals would allow an average of 182 days let over several years and permit up to 14 charity days to count towards the target. While aiming to support businesses, critics argue these "small changes" are insufficient to address the crisis facing Welsh tourism, which has seen a significant drop in overnight visitors since the rules were introduced in 2023.

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of federal troops in US cities like Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, and his musings about Chicago, are raising concerns about a potential shift towards an authoritarian presidency. Legal experts highlight the erosion of cultural prohibitions against military deployment on American streets, citing the Posse Comitatus Act which restricts military involvement in law enforcement. The article details D.C.'s unique status, allowing easier federal control, and discusses the subtext of immigration enforcement. Critics fear Trump's fast-moving executive orders and increased ICE funding could normalize such actions, despite ongoing legal challenges.</p>
