          <p>Chinese tech giant Tencent announced a 13% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, propelled by strong growth in its gaming division, particularly from titles like "Honor of Kings" and "PUBG Mobile." While revenue exceeded expectations at 180.02 billion Chinese yuan, net profit fell slightly short, registering at 47.8 billion yuan. Tencent's WeChat platform, boasting over 1.4 billion monthly active users, has also seen substantial growth in advertising revenue through its video, search, and Mini Program offerings, as the company continues to monetize its extensive user base and expand its digital services. The article highlights Tencent's robust performance in both domestic and international gaming markets, underscoring its position as a leading global gaming company.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, experts suggest that investors should consider allocating 5% to 10% of their portfolio to gold as a safe haven asset, while emphasizing the importance of assessing individual risk appetite and market conditions. It's recommended to buy gold gradually over time to mitigate the risk of purchasing at a high point and to allow for adjustments based on market trends, such as interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events. Financial advisors recommend rebalancing portfolios annually to ensure diversification and maintaining the appropriate gold allocation, cautioning against over-investing due to storage, tax, and liquidity concerns. The article advises monitoring market indicators and adjusting gold purchases based on real interest rates, dollar strength, and geopolitical stress (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a tariff truce with the United States, China is preparing for ongoing rivalry with Washington, focusing on economic and diplomatic opportunities in Asia while maintaining a firm stance on regional territorial claims. According to this New York Times article, Beijing views the tariff reduction as a tactical retreat by the U.S. rather than a fundamental shift in hostile intentions towards the Chinese Communist Party. China's approach includes presenting itself as a stable alternative in the face of upheaval in Washington's trade policy, while simultaneously asserting its power and warning against external interference in its frontier regions. This strategy reflects a belief that economic incentives and territorial ambitions can coexist, as China continues to pursue both cooperation and competition in its foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Student loan borrowers in default may have up to 15% of their Social Security benefits garnished to repay their debt, though beneficiaries are supposed to be left with at least $750 per month. Borrowers should receive at least a 30-day warning before the offset, sent to their last known address, emphasizing the importance of keeping contact information current with loan servicers. The article explains that borrowers have the right to challenge the offset by proving financial hardship or having a pending student loan discharge. Experts advise borrowers who receive such notices not to panic but to seek help immediately to explore their options and contest the collection activity.</p>

Ms. Ventura's testimony included graphic descriptions of sexual acts she claims she did not consent to, and she explained that she feared Mr. Combs's anger and his power over her career. The judge denied a request to downplay Ms. Venturaâ€™s visible pregnancy, and Mr. Combsâ€™s lawyers have depicted the sexual encounters as consensual.</p>

China is emphasizing self-sufficiency and diversifying its exports to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Latin America, even as the U.S. enforces tariff exemptions on products with significant China-made components. Experts anticipate further tariff cuts and a continuation of the largest trading relationship in the world, though some caution that the U.S. remains on the offensive and China is learning to prepare for future challenges.</p>

          <p>To combat its declining birthrate, Japan is considering eliminating out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, by covering normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system. Currently, childbirth is not covered by insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures, though the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, which often falls short of actual expenses. If implemented, this policy would establish a unified price nationwide, though obstetricians have raised concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

Israel's military actions in southern Syria and Turkey's influence in the north exacerbate internal tensions, fueling perceptions of foreign support for certain groups and undermining the new government's authority.

By targeting middle-income countries for funding, NeoTest hopes to demonstrate that major international health projects can be supported by the countries they are designed to help, reducing reliance on traditional foreign aid.

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock argues that Republican-backed Medicaid work requirements would negatively impact hardworking Americans by reducing their access to healthcare coverage. Warnock cites experiences in Arkansas and Georgia as evidence that such rules, which he terms "work reporting requirements," involve excessive red tape that prevents eligible individuals from receiving care. He contends that providing healthcare without these requirements encourages work and strengthens the economy, contrasting with Republican claims that Medicaid subsidizes those who choose not to work. Warnock points to CBO findings that Republicans cannot achieve their budget goals without cutting Medicaid, and a report suggesting millions could lose coverage if work requirements are implemented.</p>

          <p>Following US President Donald Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria, the war-torn nation is poised for an investment boom aimed at aiding economic reconstruction after 14 years of civil war. The move, which reverses a long-standing policy, has been met with jubilation in Damascus and is expected to facilitate the delivery of aid, attract investments from wealthy neighbors, and foster regional stability. While challenges remain, including the need for massive investment and resettlement of displaced people, the easing of sanctions is seen as a crucial step towards rebuilding Syria's devastated infrastructure and economy, though the speed and scope of the sanctions' removal remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has condemned the suspected arson attacks on properties linked to him as an "attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for." Counter-terrorism officers are investigating the fires, treating them as suspicious, after incidents at his private home in north London and a property he previously lived in. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch echoed the sentiment, stating the attacks were "completely unacceptable" and an assault on democracy, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey offered support to Starmer and his family.</p>

          <p>Qatar's efforts to rehabilitate its global reputation, once tarnished by accusations of funding terrorism, have culminated in President Trump's visit to Doha and a potential gift of a luxury jetliner, according to this New York Times article. The visit marks a significant turnaround for the Gulf emirate, which has spent millions on lobbyists and hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2022 to improve its image. Despite lingering skepticism and criticism, Qatar's role as a mediator in the Gaza conflict and its strategic relationship with the U.S., including the sale of liquefied natural gas and the use of Al Udeid Air Base, have solidified its position in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to extend the qualifying period for permanent settlement from five to ten years, affecting migrants already in the country, a move that has drawn criticism and concerns about potential disruption to lives and businesses. The government argues that this measure is necessary to ensure that settlement becomes a privilege earned through contribution to the UK's economy and society, while some Labour MPs have raised concerns about the impact on their constituents. The change could lead to increased visa-fee revenue for the Home Office but also create longer periods without the rights associated with permanent settlement, such as access to benefits and the ability to apply for citizenship.</p>

While the assistant referee followed protocol by allowing play to continue, the severity of Awoniyi's injury has prompted discussions about whether the "late flag" approach exposes players to unnecessary risks.</p>

This "court-baiting" strategy involves championing popular but likely illegal policies, provoking court challenges, and then using the unpopular decisions to condemn the judiciary. By emphasizing the popularity of these policies, leaders can mobilize voters against the courts, ultimately eroding the judiciary's role as a check on executive authority, as seen in Turkey and Mexico.</p>

Although Mr. Sinwar is a significant military commander and an obstacle to a cease-fire, Hamas's decision-making is collective, and his death might not alter the group's overall approach to negotiations with Israel.
