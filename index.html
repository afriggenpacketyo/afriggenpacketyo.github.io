          <p>Hurricane Erin is projected to grow as it moves up the Atlantic Ocean, posing a threat of dangerous rip currents along the East Coast. While the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., North Carolina's Outer Banks are under tropical storm and storm surge warnings, prompting mandatory evacuations for Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands. Coastal areas from Florida to Long Island are warned of life-threatening surf and rip currents, with officials urging people to heed local warnings. The hurricane is large, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward, and the worst conditions are expected late Wednesday through Thursday as Erin passes closest to the coast. The storm is the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, which is predicted to be above-normal, but is not forecast to directly hit the U.S. 80</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated Putin has agreed to meet with Zelenskyy, although Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has been less committal. The U.S. aims to facilitate direct diplomacy between the two countries, but insists no U.S. ground troops will be sent to Ukraine, offering instead to help coordinate security guarantees with European allies. These security guarantees, according to Trump, will involve European nations placing soldiers on the ground, while the U.S. will provide air support and intelligence sharing, stopping short of NATO membership for Ukraine. 70</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Disadvantages of Annuities for Retirement Planning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 14:24:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities have become a popular retirement planning tool, offering stability and lifelong payouts, but they also come with significant drawbacks. High fees, including management fees and surrender charges for early withdrawals, can erode returns over time, and complex contracts can be difficult for retirees to understand. Inflation poses a threat to fixed annuities, as the purchasing power of fixed payments decreases as costs rise. While annuities provide safety, they often sacrifice the growth potential of stock investments, and they rely on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, unlike FDIC-insured accounts. Despite these drawbacks, the current rate environment and market volatility concerns may favor annuities for some retirees, but they should complement, not replace, a comprehensive retirement strategy.

          <p>Apple is reportedly increasing iPhone production in India as the country faces potential tariffs from the U.S. over its Russian oil purchases. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the U.S. is planning to increase tariffs on India for "profiteering" from buying and reselling sanctioned Russian oil. Apple's expansion in India includes new plants and factories belonging to the Tata Group and Foxconn Technology, with plans to create a new iPhone model in India next year. This move aims to reduce Apple's reliance on China and comes as the company commits to investing more in U.S. manufacturing, including expanding iPhone glass maker Corning's production. 75</p>

          <p>ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter suggests a future "divorce" between Micah Parsons and the Dallas Cowboys due to a contract standoff. Parsons has been present at the Cowboys' training camp but has not participated in practices, and negotiations between his representatives and the team have stalled. Parsons reportedly requested a trade due to frustrations over contract discussions, while Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has publicly stated he does not intend to trade Parsons. The situation is described as personal, with both sides seemingly angry, and Schefter believes a resolution is unlikely despite past instances of players reaching deals after requesting trades. 60</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that Intel should give the U.S. government an equity stake in the company in return for CHIPS Act funds. This proposal would convert what was previously a grant under the Biden administration into equity for the American people, without providing governance or voting rights. Intel and SoftBank recently announced a $2 billion investment from the Japanese conglomerate in the chipmaker. Lutnick also hinted that President Trump may pursue similar deals with other CHIPS recipients, moving away from what he characterized as the Biden administration's "free" grants to companies like Intel and TSMC.

Newcastle coach Eddie Howe emphasized the need for new strikers, but securing replacements has proven challenging.

An "Article 5-like" arrangement, similar to NATO's principle of collective defense, is being considered, but it's unclear how it would differ from formal NATO membership.

          <p>The senior living market is facing a significant supply-demand imbalance as the boomer generation ages, with more than 4 million boomers set to turn 80 in the next five years. Occupancy rates are rising, while annual inventory growth has dropped below 1%, the lowest since 2006. Ventas CEO Deb Cafaro is betting big on the "longevity economy," citing a projected 28% growth in the senior living demand pool. High interest rates are hindering new development, leading to a severe lack of supply. 80</p>

          <p>Crypto stocks experienced a downturn as investors moved away from tech stocks and riskier assets. Major crypto exchanges and financial services firms saw significant declines, with bitcoin also pulling back. The shift is attributed to investors rotating out of tech names following a boost last week driven by expectations of interest rate cuts. Investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole for clues about future policy decisions, which could influence the crypto market. 60</p>

          <p>Air Force Chief of Staff General David Allvin announced he will retire in November, two years into his four-year term. Allvin did not provide a reason for his early departure, but expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve. This follows a series of exits by top military officers this year, including the firing of Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr. and the ousting of other high-ranking officials. The circumstances surrounding Allvin's retirement are characterized as a decision between him and Air Force Secretary Troy Meink. 65</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed its AA+ credit rating for the U.S., citing that tariff revenue will offset weaker finances. The agency acknowledged economic concerns, including the impact of tax cuts and high debt, but emphasized the resilience of the U.S. economy. The report highlighted that meaningful tariff revenue is expected to offset weaker fiscal outcomes associated with recent fiscal legislation. This assessment comes after Moody's downgraded the U.S. in May, raising concerns about growing debt and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

In a letter, the American Soybean Association (ASA) warned of dire long-term economic consequences if China continues to shun U.S. soybeans. They emphasized the extreme financial stress faced by soybean farmers due to dropping prices and rising input costs. China's shift towards Brazilian soybeans could cost U.S. farmers billions, as China bought 54% of U.S. soybean exports in the 2023-2024 marketing year. 60</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) is considering a proposal to reduce the number of professional rugby sides in Wales from four to two. The plan includes creating two organizations, each with a men's and women's team, with a six-week consultation period before a final decision. The WRU says there will be significantly elevated funding for each men's squad, which would facilitate a radically different profile of talent and support. The Union says the two squads would feature predominantly Welsh-qualified players, while there would be a rethink on non-Welsh qualified players. 65</p>

Zelenskyy presented his own map, disputing the extent of Russian control, but Trump remains convinced of Russia's superior force. Despite arguments about the percentages, the map has influenced Trump's perception of the conflict and the potential for a resolution involving territorial concessions. 50</p>

          <p>Iran faces a difficult decision following its war with Israel: either make diplomatic concessions or risk further military strikes. After the war, Iran has been reluctant to engage with the IAEA or the U.S., but the E-3 (United Kingdom, Germany, and France) are threatening a snapback of global sanctions if Tehran doesn't make concessions. With its nuclear program damaged, Iran has limited leverage and must decide whether to give up uranium enrichment or accept the E3's interim concessions offer. The choice is between "drinking from the poisoned chalice" of diplomacy or facing more airstrikes. 60</p>
