          <h2>Neurologist Explains Why Migraines May Worsen During Summer Months</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 13:04:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neurologist from NYU Langone Health explains that weather-related changes, such as shifts from outdoor sun to indoor air conditioning, can trigger more frequent migraines in the summer. Dehydration is also a significant factor, making consistent hydration with water and electrolytes crucial for prevention. Experts also recommend wearing sunglasses to block out bright light, ensuring proper rest to manage stress, and using fragrance-free summer products like sunscreen to avoid odor-related triggers. These preventative measures can help sufferers manage the increased risk associated with the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has dismissed a request from former White House physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor to pause an investigation into President Biden's cognitive health. O'Connor's lawyers cited a parallel Department of Justice investigation and invoked the Fifth Amendment, arguing against violating physician-patient privilege. Comer described these moves as tactics to avoid testimony about what he terms a "cover-up" of Biden's cognitive decline, asserting that congressional and DOJ probes can proceed simultaneously. The confrontation occurred after O'Connor's deposition lasted only 30 minutes.</p>

          <p>A Boston resident named Jean Powers has created a "not mail" box outside her home, inviting neighbors and strangers to share anonymous thoughts, poems, secrets, and stories. The project, which began during the pandemic, has become a source of profound human connection, with contributions ranging from humorous observations to deeply personal and heartfelt confessions. Powers cherishes the opportunity to "look into the hearts and souls of strangers," finding beauty in the anonymous vulnerability and creativity shared by her community. The initiative highlights a simple yet powerful way to foster connection.</p>

          <p>The mother of Dontae Melton, who died in Baltimore police custody on June 24, is demanding answers regarding the circumstances of his death. Melton, who had a known mood disorder, was restrained by police during an apparent mental health crisis, but a requested medic never arrived, partly due to a city-wide computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system failure. His mother revealed that just a day earlier, a judge had denied her emergency petition to get him help. The investigation is examining multiple system failures, and the family is awaiting the release of body-camera footage.</p>

During the 201.5km hilly stage to Vire Normandie, Healy broke away from an eight-man group with 42km remaining and maintained his lead to finish nearly three minutes ahead of his closest competitors. Meanwhile, Mathieu van der Poel finished far enough ahead of the main peloton to reclaim the overall leader's yellow jersey from Tadej Pogacar by a single second.

          <p>An analysis by New York Times reporter Adam Liptak suggests that the Supreme Court has recently issued decisions that effectively expand the power of the executive branch. The rulings have reportedly limited the authority of lower courts to issue broad injunctions against federal policies, a move that strengthens the presidency. Furthermore, the Court's increasing use of its "shadow docket" for consequential orders without full arguments or explanations is seen as another mechanism challenging the traditional constitutional balance. These trends are raising concerns about a significant shift in power toward the presidency.</p>

          <p>For those struggling with high-interest credit card debt, debt forgiveness—negotiating a lump-sum settlement with creditors for less than the total amount owed—can be a viable solution. This strategy is particularly beneficial if you are paying more in interest than principal or have been hit with high penalty APRs. While this approach can negatively impact your credit score in the short term, it can result in significant long-term savings for individuals who have stopped using their cards and are focused on repayment.

Calculations show that in most short-term scenarios (3, 6, and 12 months), a CD currently earns slightly more guaranteed interest than a money market account, making it the preferable option for savers who prioritize higher, predictable returns.

          <p>Despite ongoing negotiations and meetings between U.S. and Israeli leaders, no ceasefire agreement for Gaza has been reached, and Israeli military operations continue across the territory. The U.S.-based charity Project HOPE reported that an Israeli strike killed 15 civilians, including 10 children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside its clinic in Deir al-Balah. The organization condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" and said it was investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is facing a new phase of Russia's air war, characterized by massive, coordinated waves of hundreds of drones and missiles targeting its cities. Residents in Kyiv and other urban centers report that the increased scale and intensity of these attacks are spreading fear and wearing down morale, forcing many back into bomb shelters. Russia is using swarms of modified Iranian-supplied Shahed drones, which are harder to defend against and designed to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses. This escalation represents a war of resources, prompting continued appeals from Ukraine for more advanced air defense systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to temporarily lead NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, Jared Isaacman. The president cited Isaacman's past donations to Democrats and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has major NASA contracts, as reasons for pulling the nomination. Duffy, who will serve in a dual-hatted role, takes over the space agency at a critical time as it pursues ambitious goals to return astronauts to the moon and eventually land humans on Mars. The move comes amid a public feud between Trump and Musk.</p>

A former county IT director who monitored emergency radio traffic said a firefighter's request to send an alert was put on hold to await supervisor approval. While the National Weather Service did issue 22 warnings for the area, including a "PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION" alert, many residents said they received no local warnings.

This narrow approval means that insurance companies are often denying coverage for patients with chronic pain, who could greatly benefit from a non-opioid option.

The author contends that Netanyahu is exploiting Trump's ego to distract from international pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza and to prolong the conflict for his own political survival. The piece suggests that by appealing to Trump's desire for recognition, Netanyahu successfully deflected pressure to reach an agreement with Hamas during their White House meeting. The nomination is framed as a tactic to maintain power and avoid accountability.</p>

However, after a subsequent 2021 audit alleged another $20.8 million in excess profits, the company did not issue a refund.

          <p>Scientific research supports the idea that sunshine can genuinely improve happiness, largely by affecting mood-regulating brain regions and promoting Vitamin D synthesis. Studies show sunlight has a positive effect on well-being, though for some, direct sun can increase anxiety. Experts recommend incorporating 5 to 10 minutes of direct sun exposure into a daily morning routine to regulate circadian rhythms and boost mood. However, it's also crucial to avoid bright artificial light at night, which can disrupt sleep. While beneficial, sunlight is just one component of happiness.</p>

The regulation, which is being phased in over two years, applies to both domestic and imported animal products sold in restaurants and grocery stores. While these practices are standard in global industrial agriculture, they are now subject to mandatory transparency in Switzerland.

Anthropologists and marketing experts suggest that as traditional affiliations decline, consumer behavior has taken their place, with brands becoming a way for people to signal their values and find a tribe. These stores build loyalty by catering to specific regional, cultural, or lifestyle identities, making shopping there a statement about who you are. This phenomenon reflects a broader cultural shift where fandom has become a primary force in social life.</p>
