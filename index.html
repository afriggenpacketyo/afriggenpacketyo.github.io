          <h2>Study Links Fossil Fuel Companies to Trillions in Climate Damage Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 18:40:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Dartmouth College study published in "Nature" estimates that emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020. The study presents a peer-reviewed method for tying emissions to specific climate harms, aiming to hold companies liable for extreme weather costs. The top five emitting companies, including Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP, are linked to over $9 trillion in climate damage. Researchers determined that pollution from Chevron, for example, has raised the Earth's temperature by .045 degrees Fahrenheit. Optimism score is 60 because while the report is bad news, it does not necessarily mean there will be additional loss of human life.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the U.S. government owes North Dakota nearly $28 million to cover the costs of policing the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 and 2017. The state filed the lawsuit in 2019, seeking $38 million for policing the demonstrations against the pipeline's Missouri River crossing, which the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposed, fearing water supply pollution. The judge found the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers liable for failing to follow mandatory procedures, causing harm to the state. The pipeline has been transporting oil since June 2017, carrying roughly 5% of the United States' daily oil production.</p>

          <p>A group of former OpenAI employees, Nobel laureates, law professors, and civil society organizations sent a letter to attorneys general in California and Delaware urging them to halt the startup's restructuring efforts, citing safety concerns. The group argues that converting to a for-profit entity would "subvert OpenAI's charitable purpose" and "remove nonprofit control and eliminate critical governance safeguards." They fear this change would compromise the company's mission and founding principles, as leadership repeatedly emphasized that OpenAI's primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. The company is still overseen by a nonprofit parent but announced last year that it would convert into a for-profit company, wresting control from the nonprofit but keeping it as a separate arm.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs, the White House confirmed, following reports that auto parts could be excluded from tariffs on imports from China. This exemption would be separate from the 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts scheduled to take effect by May 3. Trump also reportedly mentioned a potential increase in tariffs on cars imported from Canada to the U.S. Automakers and auto policy groups have been lobbying Trump for relief on tariffs, which have been accumulating on the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the NFL draft, an anonymous NFL coach criticized former Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, calling him "entitled" and claiming he had the "worst formal interview" the coach had ever experienced. The coach cited concerns about Sanders' body language, tendency to blame teammates, and perceived lack of skill. Another AFC executive echoed this sentiment, stating that Sanders wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. Sanders' father, Deion Sanders, believes the criticism stems from his own legacy, stating that his sons were "built for this."</p>

          <p>Experts cast doubt on President Trump's claim that finger tattoos on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, prove MS-13 membership. Trump shared an image of Abrego Garcia's hand with digitally added labels interpreting the tattoos as gang-related symbols, which was refuted by gang experts. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record, and his family denies any gang involvement. Experts acknowledge that certain symbols can be associated with gangs, but the tattoos alone are not reliable indicators of membership, and experts do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos are suggestive of MS-13 membership.</p>

          <p>Victims of violent crimes and stalking are advocating for the creation of restricted zones where convicted killers and stalkers would be required to live after their release from prison. They argue that exclusion zones, which prevent offenders from entering certain areas, should be "flipped on its head" to allow victims to feel safer. Some experts raise concerns that such an approach could breach the human rights of perpetrators. The Ministry of Justice states that exclusion zones prevent offenders from approaching their victims.</p>

          <p>This article explores the early development of Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, detailing his time at Willem II's academy and the challenges he faced. Despite his physical strength and natural talent, Van Dijk was sometimes perceived as laconic and even lazy, arriving late for training sessions. However, his personal circumstances, including caring for his younger siblings after his parents' divorce, contributed to his occasional tardiness. This period shaped him both as a human and a footballer, ultimately contributing to his success.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a drone-mounted quantum sensor system for submarine detection in the South China Sea. The system, tested successfully in offshore trials, achieved picotesla precision to track magnetic anomalies and map seabed resources. This technology overcomes limitations of traditional optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) in low-latitude regions, potentially enhancing the People’s Liberation Army's anti-submarine capabilities. The sensor can pinpoint a submarine and detect the tail waves it generates, according to previous studies.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue, citing a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather conditions. Same-store sales declined for the first time since 2020, and the company lowered the top end of its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth. Customers began pulling back their spending in February due to economic uncertainty. Chipotle is also projecting higher inflation in the second quarter, partly due to the White House's tariffs on aluminum and a broad 10% import duty (not investment advice).</p>
