          <p>Lewis Hamilton of Ferrari expressed confidence for the British Grand Prix after a competitive showing in Friday's practice sessions at Silverstone. He finished third, closely behind McLaren's Lando Norris and his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc, despite McLaren and Red Bull introducing new upgrades. Hamilton noted he is feeling more comfortable with the car and believes a strong weekend is possible, especially with rain forecasted for qualifying and the race. The strong pace from Ferrari has positioned them as serious contenders against the championship-leading McLaren team for the upcoming race.</p>

          <p>The direct action group Palestine Action is set to be proscribed as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary injunction. The ban, which takes effect at midnight, will criminalize membership or support for the group, with penalties of up to 14 years in prison. The government's decision followed actions claimed by the group that caused an estimated £7 million in damages. Palestine Action's co-founder called the decision a "dystopian nightmare" and announced plans for an urgent appeal, arguing it is an authoritarian move against a civil disobedience group.</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the location of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident occurred at a facility operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, and officials had previously stated that seven people were unaccounted for. The company, which was reportedly operating without the necessary local licenses on agricultural land, has expressed condolences. The explosion caused significant damage, spread to nearby grass fires, and led to mandatory evacuations in the area, with federal agencies like the ATF joining the investigation into the cause.</p>

          <p>Members of the UK's House of Lords have strongly urged the government to end the injustice of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentences, which were abolished in 2012 but not retroactively. This has left over 2,500 prisoners incarcerated indefinitely without a resentencing process, a situation one peer described as an "industrial-scale miscarriage of justice." Proponents of reform highlighted cases of individuals serving decades beyond their original minimum tariffs for relatively minor crimes. Despite these impassioned pleas and support from a UN special rapporteur, the prisons minister maintained that public protection is the priority and did not commit to resentencing.</p>

          <p>An interventional cardiologist with over two decades of experience has outlined five types of food he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, citing their role in inflammation and blood sugar issues. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency asserts that a newly passed bill by the Trump administration validates its decision to freeze billions of dollars allocated for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The legislation repeals the program, often called a "green bank," which was created to finance climate-friendly projects. This development is central to an ongoing lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups who were awarded funds and argue the EPA illegally denied them access. The EPA contends the bill rescinds the unobligated funds, while the nonprofits claim the money was already disbursed and cannot be clawed back this way.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic slur "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes in his new spending bill, Trump used the term to refer to predatory lenders. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," emphasizing that such words from leaders matter. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he understood it to simply mean a moneylender who charges high rates of interest.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint detailing a scam where perpetrators impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee to steal over $250,000 in cryptocurrency. The scammers used fraudulent email addresses, cleverly designed to mimic the official committee's domain, to trick victims into sending funds. The complaint states that the emails, appearing to be from a committee co-chair, solicited donations that were then diverted to various cryptocurrency addresses. The U.S. government is now seeking the permanent seizure of the recovered funds to deter further criminal activity and potentially compensate the victims.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed its largest aerial attack on Kyiv since the war began, launching hundreds of missiles and drones at the Ukrainian capital overnight. The assault, which killed at least one person and injured over 20, came shortly after President Trump held separate, unproductive phone calls with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump expressed disappointment with his call with Putin, while Zelenskyy described his conversation as useful, focusing on Ukraine's air defense needs. The massive bombardment damaged residential buildings and critical infrastructure across the city.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign his landmark tax and spending package into law, a highly divisive bill that narrowly passed Congress. The legislation extends his first-term tax cuts, increases defense spending, boosts funding for immigration enforcement, and makes steep cuts to Medicaid. While the White House touts the bill as a catalyst for economic growth, Democrats and some Republicans have criticized its potential to increase the national debt and harm low-income Americans. Polling suggests many Americans disapprove of the package, setting the stage for significant political debate.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to combat the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef in Miami. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other partners, uses corals crossbred from Florida and a warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to introduce more heat-tolerant genetic diversity into Florida's iconic Elkhorn coral populations, which have been devastated by bleaching events caused by rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time international crossbreeding has been permitted for planting on wild reefs, offering hope for their survival.</p>

          <p>Germany's decision to significantly increase its defense spending has sparked a debate among economists about its potential impact on the broader economy. While arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall have seen their stock prices and order backlogs soar, some economists are skeptical that this will translate into substantial overall growth. A study suggests that military spending has a lower economic multiplier effect compared to investments in infrastructure or education. Critics warn that the spending may primarily boost arms companies' profits rather than Germany's defense capabilities or overall economic output. (not investment advice)</p>
