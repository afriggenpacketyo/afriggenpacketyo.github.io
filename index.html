        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy exhibited signs of significant strain in August, as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output fell short of forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.4%, a slowdown from July's 3.7%, and industrial output increased by 5.2%, also missing expectations. National fixed-asset investment rose by a modest 0.5% in the first eight months of 2025, below predictions. The prolonged property downturn continued to weigh heavily, with property investment declining 12.9% in the same period. This article highlights sluggish domestic demand and ongoing headwinds from the US trade war as major contributors to the economic challenges.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 21:54:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Legislature has passed Senate Bill 627, known as the "No Secret Police Act," which restricts most local and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face masks during operations. The bill, introduced by Democratic state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, aims to increase transparency and public trust, especially following heightened immigration enforcement. It allows for exemptions in specific situations like SWAT operations or medical necessity. However, the Department of Homeland Security has voiced strong opposition, asserting that the bill undermines officer safety. This legislation now moves to Governor Gavin Newsom for final approval, reflecting a broader national discussion on police accountability and public perception.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Long Beach has canceled its annual Día de los Muertos parade, a decision driven by community concerns over federal immigration raids. Despite no direct threats to the event, city officials and Councilmember Mary Zendejas opted for cancellation "out of an abundance of caution" due to recent widespread enforcement actions in Southern California. These actions are bolstered by a Supreme Court ruling that allows federal agents to stop and detain individuals based on factors like job, language, or appearance, fueling fears among residents. In response, the city has approved reallocating this year's parade funds to 2026 and significantly increased its Long Beach Justice Fund for immigration legal aid.</p>

Mamdani, who currently leads in public opinion polls, has focused his campaign on addressing the city's affordability crisis with proposals such as free public transport and expanded childcare. Governor Hochul highlighted Mamdani's dedication to creating a safer and more affordable New York, while Mamdani acknowledged the governor's role in uniting the Democratic party. Republican critics, however, have strongly condemned the endorsement, labeling Mamdani a "raging Communist."</p>

          <p>Liberia's lead climate official, Artur Becker, has voiced significant alarm over the country's inadequate preparedness for coastal erosion and floods, disclosing that the national climate adaptation plan is unfunded. This critical lack of resources leaves millions of Liberians highly vulnerable to the intensifying effects of rising sea levels and extreme weather, driven by human-caused pollution. Becker underscored that the plan, despite outlining necessary interventions, is ineffective without substantial financial support. While some projects and international aid address immediate disaster response, experts warn of growing exposure, highlighting the urgent need for integrated funding and innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds to bolster long-term protection efforts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly affirmed that foreign workers are "welcome" in the United States, just days after a significant immigration operation led to the arrest of hundreds of South Korean nationals. In a post on Truth Social, Trump articulated a desire not to "frighten off" investors, emphasizing the importance of foreign expertise for teaching Americans to manufacture complex products like semiconductors. This statement comes in the wake of a September 4 ICE raid at a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery factory in Georgia, where around 475 South Koreans were detained for visa-related issues. The incident drew sharp criticism from South Korea, with its president warning of potential discouragement for future investments, highlighting a complex interplay between immigration policy and international economic relations.</p>

          <p>A significant number of drivers are finding themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, meaning they owe more than their car's market value, a trend reaching a four-year high. According to Edmunds, 26.6% of trade-ins for new car purchases in the second quarter of 2025 carried negative equity, with an average deficit of $6,754. This financial predicament often stems from factors like extended loan terms, such as increasingly common 84-month loans, or insufficient down payments. Financial experts advise consumers to keep their current vehicle if feasible or, if a new purchase is necessary, to secure pre-approved, lower-interest loans. The article also highlights the importance of considering guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance to mitigate risks associated with negative equity. (not investment advice)</p>

This article delves into the complex dynamic of their unwavering support amidst increasing farm bankruptcies and disrupted supply chains.

This article provides four actionable strategies to alleviate such mental cloudiness, including the deliberate scheduling of short "firebreaks" between activities. These brief pauses allow the mind to process information, release stress, and prepare for subsequent tasks.

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly submitted a request to Congress for $58 million to significantly increase security measures for both the executive and judicial branches. This urgent request follows the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. According to sources, the additional funds are primarily designated for the U.S. Marshals Service, specifically to enhance the protection of Supreme Court justices. While the White House supports increased funding for congressional lawmakers' security, it defers that decision to the legislative branch. This development precedes a crucial September 30 government funding deadline, underscoring escalating concerns about threats to public officials, with the U.S. Capitol Police anticipating over 14,000 threats by year-end.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has disclosed that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is refusing to cooperate with authorities. Governor Cox indicated that investigators are actively working to establish a motive for the attack, with further information anticipated during Robinson's upcoming court appearance. Insights from the suspect's family and friends suggest Robinson held left-leaning political views and harbored animosity towards Kirk. The governor also noted that Robinson's transgender romantic partner has been fully cooperative and had no prior knowledge of the events. Ammunition discovered with the weapon was notably engraved with taunting, anti-fascist messages, suggesting a politically charged motive behind the targeted attack.</p>

          <p>An opinion article contends that UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond should not be entrusted with the sole responsibility of hiring the university's next football coach, given his contentious track record. The author sharply criticizes Jarmond's decision to retain Chip Kelly longer than advisable and his subsequent hurried, under-qualified appointment of DeShaun Foster, who was recently fired after a disappointing season. While acknowledging Jarmond's achievements in other sports, the article stresses that football's paramount financial and reputational significance necessitates a more robust and accountable hiring process. It proposes that UCLA's chancellor should intervene, perhaps by appointing a dedicated football general manager or considering a change in athletic director, to prevent a third consecutive coaching misstep.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a highly respected two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has passed away at the age of 79 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. Edgar is widely credited with bringing greater financial stability to the state during the 1990s, successfully implementing budget cuts and securing the permanence of a temporary income tax surcharge to ensure stable funding for public education. A moderate Republican, he enjoyed significant popularity, winning re-election comfortably, even in heavily Democratic areas. Later in life, Edgar remained an influential party statesman, expressing discomfort with the Republican Party's rightward shift and notably endorsing Kamala Harris for president last year.

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy asserts that Manchester United's persistent struggles are primarily due to suboptimal player selection and positioning, rather than inherent flaws in manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 tactical system. Murphy observes improvements in the team's compactness and defensive organization but stresses that individual mistakes continue to undermine these advancements. He specifically cites Bruno Fernandes's deployment in a deeper midfield role, where his defensive contributions are weak, and Luke Shaw's forced adaptation to a center-back position as critical examples. Murphy concludes that despite the system's potential, current personnel choices are creating significant vulnerabilities, preventing the team from achieving consistent positive outcomes and maximizing its strategic improvements.</p>

For North Korea's Kim, his attendance marked a carefully orchestrated return to the international stage, offering legitimacy without the prerequisite of denuclearization. The article concludes that this visible alignment signals to other isolated regimes that Beijing provides diplomatic lifelines, reinforcing the notion that engagement with China can proceed without adhering to Western terms of reform.</p>

The podcast "Sea Change" explores these issues, focusing on Nunapitchuk, Alaska, where thawing permafrost causes extensive damage to infrastructure, and Pointe-au-Chien, Louisiana, which experiences significant land loss due to sea-level rise. While Nunapitchuk aims to relocate but faces funding obstacles, Pointe-au-Chien is committed to remaining, employing natural restoration projects and elevating homes.

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a tragic increase in maternal and infant deaths in Afghanistan, directly linked to the abrupt cessation of US aid, which led to the closure of over 400 medical facilities. Stories like Abdul's, whose wife and newborn died after finding their local clinic shut, underscore the devastating impact in a country with historically high maternal mortality rates. The Trump administration justified the cuts by citing concerns over funds benefiting the Taliban, an allegation the Taliban denies. With clinics closed and the main regional hospital severely overcrowded and underfunded, the situation for Afghan women's health is dire, exacerbated by Taliban restrictions on female education and healthcare training.</p>
