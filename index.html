          <p>Several UK newspapers led with the massive power outage affecting Spain and Portugal, causing widespread disruptions. The Times highlighted Labour's plan for a 'milkshake tax' on sugary drinks. The Sun focused on the power cut's impact on British tourists in Benidorm, alongside reports of abuse within the BBC. The Financial Times emphasized concerns over power networks' ability to meet increasing electricity demands. The Daily Telegraph attributed the blackout to reliance on solar energy, while also reporting on an anti-Trump pact between Starmer and the EU.</p>

          <p>A study in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab can eliminate tumors in some early-stage cancer patients, potentially avoiding the need for surgery. In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer required an operation. The study focused on patients with tumors having a mismatch repair defect, a genetic problem that makes cells more responsive to immunotherapy. While promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital and requires further research.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to reinstate Columbus Day, amidst ongoing debates about the holiday's significance. Columbus Day has faced increasing criticism due to Columbus's role in the exploitation and decimation of Indigenous populations. Many now celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day, with President Biden recognizing it as a national observance. Trump's move has been praised by some Italian American groups, who see Columbus Day as a symbol of their heritage and resilience against discrimination.</p>

          <p>Experts are calling for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms to address critical staff shortages. The Society of Radiographers (SoR) highlights a significant vacancy rate among mammographers. Currently, only female staff are permitted to perform breast screening examinations. While some women express concerns about having male radiographers, others believe that if it can save lives, the gender of the provider should not matter. The SoR is also discussing whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening program.</p>

Executive orders aim to protect American communities from criminal aliens and label non-cooperative cities as engaging in a lawless insurrection. The administration is facing legal challenges, as a federal judge barred them from denying funds to sanctuary cities. California officials vow to fight Trump's actions if they violate the law.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, faces scrutiny over claims about her credentials. She has described herself as double board-certified with a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, but records show she earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine. CBS News was only able to verify her certification in family medicine. Her LinkedIn profile incorrectly lists a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine.</p>
