          <p>House Republican leaders are facing challenges in securing enough votes for their comprehensive domestic policy bill, dubbed the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act," as they navigate conflicting priorities among different factions within the party. The bill aims to slash taxes, increase military and border security funding, and cut social programs, but fiscal conservatives and moderates have clashed over the extent of spending cuts and tax breaks. Nonpartisan budget analysts estimate the bill would add trillions to the national debt, further complicating efforts to gain support. Democrats have criticized the late-night scheduling of committee meetings, accusing Republicans of attempting to conceal the bill's details from the public.</p>

The company is also increasing its efforts to attract value-conscious customers by introducing new items priced at $1 and offering a wider selection of products under $20.
