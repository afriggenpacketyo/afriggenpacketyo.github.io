          <p>Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs has cautioned that ongoing aggressive rhetoric from the United States towards China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of war. He argues that the U.S. initiated the trade war and that both nations have economic chokeholds on each other, necessitating a degree of rational cooperation. Sachs suggests that China should focus on expanding its trade relationships with developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on the increasingly hostile U.S. and European markets.

The move is a protest against a proposed congressional map that would significantly increase the GOP's advantage in future elections. This tactic has been used before in Texas politics, including in 2021 to block a voting bill, though new rules impose daily fines on absent lawmakers.

          <p>Rescue teams in Chile have recovered the body of the final miner who was trapped in the El Teniente copper mine following a tremor. This brings the total number of confirmed deaths from the incident to six, including one person killed at the time of the collapse. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, expressed condolences as authorities now shift their focus to a criminal investigation into the cause of the tunnel collapse. The incident was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor, and officials are investigating whether it was natural or induced by mining activity.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least four centuries, just days after a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region. The eruption sent a plume of ash and gas thousands of feet into the air, prompting an aviation alert. While the area is sparsely populated and no immediate threat to communities was reported, scientists are exploring the connection between the two events. Experts suggest that seismic waves from the powerful quake could have been the catalyst that triggered the long-dormant volcano's eruption.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic baserunning and timely hitting rather than power to break a scoring drought. After being shut out for 18 consecutive innings, the Dodgers manufactured runs through aggressive sends, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a winning record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team's slumping lineup as they head back home.</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for elected office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, who have resigned or left the department in recent months, are now seeking positions from local city attorney to U.S. Congress. They are campaigning on their public service records and a platform of restoring the rule of law, directly criticizing the administration's actions and the dismantling of norms within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of active wildfires across Canada, marking the country's second-worst season on record, are causing hazy skies and poor air quality in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. States including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York have issued alerts, advising residents to limit outdoor activities due to health risks from the smoke. Wind patterns are transporting the polluted air southward from the fires, many of which are burning out of control in Manitoba. Forecasters predict that this pattern may continue, suggesting prolonged periods of poor air quality for affected U.S. regions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, though payouts are expected to be modest. Following a Supreme Court ruling that found hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful but could be unfair if excessively high, the FCA will consult on a redress plan. The scheme could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with payouts likely under £950 per deal for agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator has advised affected consumers to complain directly to their lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

While Jews are permitted to visit, they are traditionally forbidden from praying there. Ben-Gvir's provocative action, which included calls for Israeli sovereignty over Gaza, was seen by Palestinians as a violation of the long-standing status quo at the contested compound.</p>
