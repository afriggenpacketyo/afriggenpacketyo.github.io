          <p>Japanese carmaker Nissan is set to cut an additional 11,000 jobs globally and shut down seven factories in response to weak sales and financial losses. This decision follows a previously failed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi, which would have created a motor industry giant. The latest layoffs bring the total job cuts announced by Nissan in the past year to approximately 20,000, or 15% of its workforce. The company also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen, with US President Donald Trump's tariffs adding further pressure to the struggling firm.</p>

          <p>Amid President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies, consumers are facing potential price increases and shortages. To mitigate the impact on household budgets, experts advise looking for sales events like Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day. Consumers should also check the origin of products, prioritizing domestic goods and those exempt under agreements like the USMCA, to avoid tariffs. Electronics and toys are expected to be hit hardest by tariffs, so consider purchasing them sooner rather than later, but avoid panic buying.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced legislation that could require many Medicaid recipients to demonstrate they are working, volunteering, or in school for at least 80 hours a month to maintain coverage. The bill aims to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to offset President Trump's tax bill. Exceptions would be made for individuals under 19, pregnant women, and those under postpartum medical care. Critics warn that the cuts could harm vulnerable Americans, with millions potentially losing coverage, while supporters argue it addresses financial waste in the program.</p>
