          <p>The UK government has signed a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence in public services like education, defense, and the justice system. The agreement, which is a non-binding statement of intent, aims to boost productivity and economic growth. As part of the partnership, OpenAI will expand its London office, and the two parties will collaborate on developing safeguards and potentially an information-sharing program to ensure the technology is used responsibly and upholds democratic values.</p>

The changes are described as part of the party's policy renewal and an effort to project unity under its new leadership. This move comes eight months into Badenoch's tenure, a period during which the party has struggled in opinion polls, consistently placing third or fourth behind Labour and other parties.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's new Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has indicated she will likely seek a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund to address the country's significant fiscal needs during its ongoing war with Russia. With global donors having only committed about half of the estimated $75 billion required over the next two years, fresh financing is crucial. The discussions are expected to take place during an IMF review in August, as Ukraine's defense minister also highlighted a need for at least $120 billion in defense spending for the upcoming year.

          <p>UK government borrowing in June rose to £20.7 billion, significantly higher than expected and adding fiscal pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The increase was driven by higher spending on public services and debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation-linked debt.

          <p>China has announced the commencement of a mega-dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which flows into India and Bangladesh as the Brahmaputra River. The project, featuring five cascade hydropower stations, is estimated to cost 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion) and will be the world's largest hydropower facility, with three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement triggered a surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure and hydropower companies, though such projects often raise environmental and geopolitical concerns with downstream nations.

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss strengthening security and economic ties. The meeting comes amid rising tensions with China in the South China Sea and a looming deadline for potential U.S. tariffs of 20% on Filipino goods. Marcos has stated his readiness to negotiate a bilateral trade deal to avert the tariffs, while the White House emphasized a shared commitment to a free and secure Indo-Pacific, underscoring the strategic importance of the alliance.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic algal bloom, which has turned a vast expanse of South Australia's coastal waters toxic green, has been declared a "natural disaster" by the state's premier. The bloom, now twice the size of the Australian Capital Territory, has suffocated marine life across more than 400 species and devastated local industries like fishing. While the state and federal governments have pledged a combined A$28 million in aid, the federal government has controversially declined to use the official "natural disaster" designation, which would trigger a larger response.</p>

          <p>The race to develop solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is intensifying, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Stellantis, along with cell producers like CATL, setting timelines for mass production before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical bridge technology, persistent technical challenges and high costs remain, even as improvements in existing battery tech create a more competitive landscape for this next-generation power source.</p>

Scott left the game in the ninth inning with a forearm injury after grimacing in pain, and he is scheduled for an MRI. The game featured a strong performance from Shohei Ohtani, who pitched three innings and hit a two-run homer, and two solo home runs from Will Smith. However, the potential loss of Scott is a major concern for the team's already injury-plagued pitching staff.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has threatened to imprison former President Jair Bolsonaro for violating a social media ban imposed on him. The ban was part of restrictions, including an ankle monitor, ordered after allegations that Bolsonaro planned a coup to overturn his election loss. The violation occurred when allies circulated a video of a speech he gave to journalists, which the judge argued was intended for social media dissemination. This development escalates the legal pressures on Bolsonaro, who is also under scrutiny for allegedly seeking U.S. interference during his presidency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's second-term policies suggests he is increasingly using tariffs as a flexible, unilateral tool for objectives typically pursued through sanctions. Unlike sanctions, which often require complex legal frameworks and international cooperation, tariffs can be deployed rapidly via executive order to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration or foreign policy alignments. This "tariff tango" approach has created significant uncertainty for global markets and US businesses, blurring the lines between economic protectionism and punitive foreign policy measures.

          <p>San Francisco is moving to approve a new policy that effectively bans people from living in recreational vehicles on city streets by imposing a strict two-hour parking limit. The plan targets at least 400 RVs that serve as homes for people who cannot afford rent, including families. While the city is offering a permit program for current residents who agree to work towards traditional housing, critics argue the policy is cruel as there is not nearly enough shelter available. Supporters, including the mayor, say the move is necessary to keep sidewalks clear and safe.</p>

Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a deceased family member's estate and consulting on how to recognize psychological harm and the impact of treatments.
