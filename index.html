          <p>At least 24 people, including children, have died after devastating flash floods struck Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically and unexpectedly, catching communities and a summer camp by surprise, with about 23 campers still unaccounted for. Officials described the event as a "mass casualty event," and extensive search and rescue operations are underway with state and federal support. The National Weather Service had significantly underestimated the rainfall, and the region lacked a warning system for such a rapid, catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>Eight OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to a larger-than-expected oil production increase of 548,000 barrels per day for August. This decision accelerates the unwinding of voluntary supply cuts, citing a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals. The move comes after the alliance had already tripled its monthly production hikes from May to July. This increase aims to balance the market amid seasonal demand and recent geopolitical tensions that briefly boosted oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military announced it successfully struck the Borisoglebsk airbase in Russia's Voronezh region, targeting a depot and several fighter jets. The attack is part of Ukraine's strategy to diminish Russia's military capabilities by hitting high-value targets deep within Russian territory. Meanwhile, Russia launched a significant wave of over 300 drones and decoys at Ukraine, with many being intercepted. The exchange of attacks occurred after Ukrainian President Zelenskyy held a productive phone call with U.S. President Trump regarding military support.</p>

          <p>A new study from researchers in China indicates that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have cancer-fighting properties. The research suggests the drug can bolster the immune system by restoring the function of dendritic cells, which are crucial for identifying and attacking tumors but often become depleted as cancer progresses. By reversing this impairment, sildenafil could potentially serve as a new form of tumor immunotherapy. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature, highlighting a promising new avenue for cancer treatment strategies.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Sean "Diddy" Combs's recent trial argues that while he was acquitted of the most severe charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, the verdict is far from a vindication. Combs was found guilty of transporting individuals for prostitution, and his own defense team admitted in court to his history of domestic abuse against his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. The article criticizes the defense's triumphant posture, suggesting it obscures the disturbing details of violence and coercion that emerged during the trial. The case highlights the difficulty of prosecuting coercive control and the power of celebrity defense strategies.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's one-night bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, followed by a declaration of victory, exemplifies a flawed American military doctrine that overestimates the strategic impact of overwhelming air power. The author contends that this approach short-circuited a more methodical Israeli campaign and reflects a historical pattern of American optimism leading to strategic failures. The article contrasts this with Ukraine's more inventive and necessity-driven military tactics, suggesting the U.S. could learn from smaller powers fighting for survival rather than relying solely on its technological and lethal superiority.</p>

Iran has already moved to suspend cooperation with IAEA inspectors, signaling its defiance.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's plan to host a UFC event on the White House lawn is more than a mere stunt; it is a form of authoritarian theater. The author, who has experience with the political use of MMA in Russia, draws parallels between Trump's actions and the use of sport by authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin to project a strongman image. The long-standing relationship between Trump and UFC CEO Dana White has intertwined the promotion with MAGA mythology, celebrating a brand of machismo and confrontational politics that blurs the line between entertainment and governance.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, a breakthrough for the industry. This project, combined with a similar one launched in May, forms the largest initiative of its kind and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The floating panels are more efficient due to the cooling effect of the water's surface. This development marks a key milestone in tapping the ocean for renewable energy and is part of China's broader efforts to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>In the wake of U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a "new international agreement" to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating tensions and advocated for placing Iran's nuclear activities under strict international supervision. This diplomatic push positions China, a key ally of Tehran, as a potential mediator and responsible global power. The call for a new deal underscores Beijing's effort to de-escalate the conflict and find a long-term solution to the regional instability.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece reflects on the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and its champion, Joey Chestnut, viewing the event as a bizarre but honest reflection of modern consumer culture. The author describes the spectacle as both grotesque and a pure distillation of will and passion, a sport that cuts to the heart of America's dysfunctional but historically rooted relationship with abundance. The article suggests that the contest, in its extreme and absurd nature, serves as a satirical mirror to a world defined by an "agony of consumption," making it a strangely fitting symbol for our times.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the long-standing scientific debate over whether culture shapes visual perception, highlighting two recent studies with conflicting findings. One study found that people from rural Namibia perceive an illusion differently than those in the US/UK, supporting the "carpentered world" hypothesis. However, another study convincingly debunks this hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it even works on animals and the newly sighted. The author suggests that perception is an active construction by the brain, meaning we all live in unique "perceptual echo chambers," which calls for humility about our own experiences.</p>

          <p>Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming for the first time since it was banned in 1923 due to pollution. Three supervised swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, have been established as part of the legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics. The reopening follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve water quality, which included building a large underground storage tank to prevent sewage overflow.

          <p>Sweden, the country that originated the "flight shaming" movement, has abolished its air passenger tax in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy. The tax, introduced in 2018, contributed to a significant drop in air travel and a shift toward rail, but also negatively impacted regional connectivity and growth. The reversal by the right-wing government highlights the tension between environmental policies and economic concerns, with airlines already announcing new routes in response. The move is seen as a blow by environmentalists but is being closely watched by other European nations that have implemented similar aviation taxes.</p>
