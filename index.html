          <p>The UK government is mandating a 15% reduction in Civil Service running costs by 2030 as part of a spending review.  This aims to save £2.2 billion annually, focusing on administrative areas like HR and communications, while frontline services remain unaffected.  However, unions warn that this will likely lead to significant job losses and negatively impact public service delivery.</p>
