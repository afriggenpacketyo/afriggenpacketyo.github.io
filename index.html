          <p>President Trump has stated there is a "50/50 chance, maybe less" of securing a trade deal with the European Union before an August 1 deadline. If an agreement is not reached, the U.S. has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from the 27-member bloc. European officials have suggested they might accept a 15% baseline tariff, but are also prepared to retaliate with levies on over $100 billion of U.S. goods. Despite the approaching deadline and the potential for a trade war, financial markets have remained relatively calm, with some analysts believing a last-minute deal will be struck.

          <p>England forward Lauren James is uncertain for the Euro 2025 final against Spain after sustaining an ankle injury during the semi-final win over Italy. James, who has been a key player with two goals in the tournament, was substituted at halftime and was seen with ice on her ankle. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that James is still recovering and that the team will give her as much time as possible to be ready for the match. Wiegman expressed her hope to have all 23 players available for the final, but a decision on James's fitness has not yet been made.</p>

          <p>Hulk Hogan, one of the most famous professional wrestlers in history, has died at the age of 71. The article reflects on his monumental role in popularizing wrestling in the 1980s, where he became a patriotic hero for millions under Vince McMahon's WWE. It examines his career trajectory, including his successful turn as a villain in the 1990s, and his unique ability to maintain his larger-than-life persona both in and out of the ring. The piece also addresses the more controversial aspects of his legacy, including racist remarks and polarizing political alliances, which complicated his image as an all-American hero.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Trump expressed his belief that the central bank is prepared to start lowering interest rates. Trump interpreted his conversation with Powell as a positive signal for the monetary policy easing he has long advocated for. This contrasts with the Fed's previous reluctance to cut rates while monitoring the economic impact of Trump's tariffs. White House officials continue to press for a review of the Fed's management and for lower rates to stimulate the economy, though futures markets do not currently anticipate a rate cut at the next meeting.

The court heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive Thorpe to be in a crisis situation, even after his wife reported he was asking for help to end his life. Thorpe, 55, had reportedly spiraled into depression after losing his coaching job.

The strike, the twelfth since March 2023, proceeds after talks failed to produce an agreement. The BMA has started granting requests for doctors to leave picket lines to work in hospitals under extreme pressure, but mass cancellations of appointments and treatments remain a significant concern.</p>

However, he expresses significant concern for the future of entry-level positions, as AI can increasingly perform the foundational work through which apprenticeships and expertise are traditionally built. Mollick argues that organizational leaders must develop a clear vision for integrating AI, rather than expecting individual employees to figure it out. He suggests that developing judgment, taste, and deep experience will become more critical skills in a world where AI handles routine tasks.</p>

          <p>Facing a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional districts in Texas, Democratic state legislators are traveling to California and Illinois to meet with Governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker. The Texas Democrats are seeking to build outside pressure against the proposed maps, which they argue are a power grab by President Trump and state Republicans to gain up to five more congressional seats. The move comes as public hearings on the redistricting have become contentious. While the meetings are largely symbolic, they aim to highlight what Democrats call an attack on fair elections, while Republicans maintain their actions are legal.</p>

          <p>This article outlines three financial strategies to help individuals avoid claiming Social Security benefits at the earliest possible age of 62, which locks in a permanently reduced monthly payment. To bridge the income gap until age 70 and maximize benefits, one can invest in an immediate or deferred income annuity to create a personal pension-like stream of revenue. Another option for homeowners is to use a reverse mortgage to tap into home equity for funds. Finally, the article advises maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs to build a sufficient savings buffer for early retirement years.

The outage occurred shortly after T-Mobile announced the public launch of its new satellite-powered service, which utilizes the Starlink network to provide connectivity in remote areas. SpaceX's vice president of Starlink engineering confirmed the outage lasted approximately 2.5 hours before service was mostly recovered, with full restoration announced later.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the country faces a worsening situation with little positive change. The junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, has cited insecurity and economic hardship as reasons for the takeover, but analysts say conditions have deteriorated. The regime has cracked down on civil liberties, forced NGOs to cease operations, leading to job losses, and deepened the nation's isolation by withdrawing from the ECOWAS regional bloc. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly distant.</p>

          <p>Germany's postal services, particularly market leader Deutsche Post/DHL, are facing a surge in customer complaints, with nearly 23,000 filed in the first half of the year. Consumers report significant delays, damaged parcels, and non-delivery of mail, problems that have escalated since 2022. Service sector unions attribute the decline in quality to ongoing job cuts and restructuring aimed at saving costs, even as the company's turnover has risen. While Deutsche Post points to a small number of complaints relative to its massive volume, the issues reflect growing public frustration with the reliability of a once-praised essential service.</p>

          <p>France's recent pledge to recognize a Palestinian state has intensified pressure on the UK government to follow suit, creating a significant diplomatic and political challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Traditionally, the UK has viewed recognition as a final step in a peace process, not a starting point, to avoid upsetting allies like the U.S. and Israel. However, the French move, intended to generate diplomatic momentum, has fueled calls from within Starmer's own party and from former diplomats for the UK to act. The government now faces a difficult choice between maintaining its long-standing policy and responding to growing political pressure.</p>

In the modern era, some have become spectacular performing attractions, while others are criticized for water waste. However, as cities face increasing heatwaves, fountains are being repurposed with misting nozzles and other technologies to provide localized cooling, demonstrating their enduring relevance in urban life.</p>

This could result in significant tax bills for borrowers, with an average IDR balance of $57,000 potentially triggering a tax liability of over $12,000 for someone in the 22% tax bracket.
