          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:18:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump expressed his gratitude after Palm Beach County, Florida, unanimously approved a resolution to rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard as "President Donald J. Trump Boulevard." The ceremonial renaming covers the roadway from Palm Beach International Airport to his Mar-a-Lago resort. The change was directed by legislation signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, which also honors three fallen sheriff's office deputies with a separate renaming on another section of the road. The new signs are expected to be installed later this year, though postal addresses will not change.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:08:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School caterers in the United Kingdom are being forced to reduce portion sizes, use cheaper ingredients, and serve less meat due to rising food costs and insufficient government funding. The chair of LACA, a school food organization, stated that the current government funding rate of £2.61 per meal is inadequate, with the actual cost being closer to £3.45. This financial gap forces schools to make difficult choices that impact the nutritional quality of lunches for millions of children. An expansion of the free school meals program is welcomed, but stakeholders stress that a significant funding increase is essential to meet standards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," draws inspiration from her own experiences moving to London and navigating the differences between American and British culture. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, follows a New York workaholic who relocates across the Atlantic, offering a modern take on the romantic comedy genre. Produced by the company behind "Notting Hill" and "Love Actually," the series features a host of celebrity cameos, including Stephen Fry, Emily Ratajkowski, and Jennifer Saunders. Dunham notes that the show explores the confounding, often humorous challenges of adapting to a new country, even one that shares the same language.</p>

          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, the most significant drop in nearly two years and worse than economists' expectations. This marks a prolonged period of deflation for producer prices, which have been falling since September 2022, largely driven by an intense price war among companies. In contrast, the consumer price index (CPI) saw a slight increase of 0.1%, returning to growth after four months of declines, though concerns about persistent overcapacity and weak demand remain. Chinese policymakers have criticized the aggressive price-cutting, which is hurting business profitability without significantly boosting consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European intelligence officials are increasingly concerned about an escalating campaign of Russian-sponsored sabotage across the continent, which has grown more violent over the past year. An Associated Press investigation documented over 70 incidents since 2022, including a recent arson attack on a London warehouse storing supplies for Ukraine, for which three men were just convicted. Authorities believe Russia's intelligence services are recruiting young, amateur proxies for these operations, often for small sums of money, to create a flexible and deniable system of disruption. Officials warn that the use of untrained saboteurs increases the risk of serious injury or death as they carry out arsons and bombings.</p>

Engineers utilized a method of creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then planted with drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. This strategy creates a robust ecological barrier to prevent sandstorms and protect agricultural lands, marking a significant milestone in the nation's environmental protection efforts.</p>

The area, known as "Flash Flood Alley," has experienced major, deadly floods on the Guadalupe River more than a dozen times in the last century, including a similar tragedy in 1987 that killed ten people. Hydrologists had recognized the potential for a significant event and a flash flood watch was issued hours before the disaster.

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States scales back its international development and foreign aid initiatives under an "America first" policy, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill the resulting gap. The piece contrasts the dismantling of U.S. aid institutions with China's increasing role in global development, exemplified by the launch of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong. The author suggests that with the center of global cooperation shifting eastward, Hong Kong, as China's most cosmopolitan city, can become a new prominent hub for providing global public goods and fostering international partnerships, particularly with the Global South.</p>

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention after advocacy from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Kashanian was detained last month from her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. Her case drew a surge of community support, with neighbors and local officials writing letters on her behalf. Scalise's intervention was described as "absolutely crucial" by her attorney, highlighting a rare case where high-level political influence led to a release amid broader immigration enforcement actions.</p>

City officials argue the raids are being conducted without coordination and are obstructing local law enforcement functions. This legal action comes as the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in the region enters its second month, with thousands of arrests reported.</p>

The ICC judges stated that the Taliban has specifically targeted females, severely depriving them of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a decision stemming from a national security investigation into the metal's supply chain. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction. The move, which is expected to take effect soon, caused domestic copper prices to jump to a record high. This action is part of a broader administration strategy of using tariffs to protect and bolster American industries, with similar investigations underway for pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. The high tariff rate matches those recently placed on steel and aluminum. (not investment advice)</p>
