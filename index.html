          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the UK is a major focus, with discussions anticipated on a new migrant returns deal. The Daily Mail criticizes France's handling of small boat crossings, while King Charles is expected to emphasize the UK-France partnership. Other prominent stories include a leaked memo suggesting the FBI has closed its investigation into associates of Jeffrey Epstein, which has drawn mixed reactions. Additionally, UK airports have begun to lift the 100ml liquid restriction in hand luggage, creating potential confusion for summer travelers as the rule change is not yet universal.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly maintained its policy interest rate at 3.85%, diverging from economists' predictions of a rate cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it requires more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2.5% target. Recent monthly inflation indicators were slightly stronger than anticipated, although first-quarter inflation remained at a four-year low. The decision comes as the country contends with slowing economic growth, weakening consumer demand, and shrinking public spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indonesia’s Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki has erupted again, sending a massive ash cloud 18 kilometers into the sky and prompting further evacuations on the island of Flores. Authorities have raised the alert to the highest level and expanded the exclusion zone, warning of potential mudflows. The eruption has caused significant travel disruptions, including the cancellation of at least 24 flights to and from Bali. Over 4,000 people have been evacuated, and communities remaining in the area are facing shortages of essential supplies like water and food.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in over 100 fatalities, with numerous people, including 11 from Camp Mystic, still missing. The disaster has brought personal tragedy to many, including the family of musician Pat Green. Senator Ted Cruz described the aftermath as horrific and acknowledged the need to review the warning timeline, while defending his own response to the crisis. The event has become politicized, with some questioning if job cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under the Trump administration impacted the warning system's effectiveness, a claim the White House has strongly denied.</p>

          <p>Beijing has issued a stern warning to the Trump administration against reinstating tariffs, threatening retaliation if the U.S. proceeds with the plan next month. The warning comes as President Trump prepares to restore tariffs that were paused to allow for trade negotiations. China's official People's Daily newspaper reiterated that dialogue is the only path forward and condemned the U.S. tariffs as "bullying." The commentary also cautioned other nations, like Vietnam, against striking deals with the U.S. that would exclude China from supply chains, stating that Beijing would respond resolutely to protect its interests.

The study, published in Nature Medicine, detailed how delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear led to significant hearing improvement in all 10 participants. The effects were evident within a month, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly all of her hearing.

          <p>Western sanctions are causing the prices of Russian-made passenger planes to nearly double, severely impacting the country's goal of achieving aviation self-sufficiency. The cost of essential materials and components has soared, with Russia's Boeing 737 equivalent, the MS-21, seeing a 60% price increase in one year. To cope with the inability to buy new Western aircraft or parts, Russia's aviation sector has reportedly resorted to smuggling parts through a gray market and manufacturing counterfeit components.

While the U.S. has traditionally been the top choice, industry insiders note that increasing instability and cultural adjustment difficulties in America are driving this shift.

The study identifies cities like San Bernardino, California, where parking lots comprise nearly half the downtown area, creating vast, poorly regulated "concrete danger zones." Driver distraction is a major factor, with a high percentage of drivers admitting to using phones, programming GPS, and even personal grooming while navigating these spaces. Poor design, including inadequate lighting, faded markings, and blind spots, further exacerbates the risks and has led to an increase in litigation.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old man wearing tactical gear and armed with a rifle was shot and killed after he opened fire on a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas. The suspect, identified as Ryan Lewis Mosqueda from Michigan, injured two police officers and a border patrol employee before being neutralized by responding agents. Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the attack, which involved the suspect firing dozens of rounds at the building. The phrase "Cordis Die," linked to a revolutionary movement in the video game Call of Duty, was found spray-painted on the suspect's vehicle.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was nominating U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The meeting was expected to focus on securing a ceasefire in the 21-month war in Gaza, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas resuming in Qatar. When questioned about the future of Palestinians in Gaza, Netanyahu suggested that those who wish to leave should be able to, a comment that has drawn criticism. He also asserted that Israel would maintain overall security control over Gaza, even if Palestinians were granted powers of self-governance.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% year-over-year decline in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of market expectations. The South Korean tech giant is struggling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a critical component for AI processors dominated by competitor Nvidia. The company's earnings have been impacted by losses in its chip foundry business and its delay in getting its latest HBM chips certified by key players like Nvidia. This guidance suggests Samsung is lagging behind rivals such as SK Hynix in capitalizing on the booming AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man in the Bay Area was stabbed and seriously injured during a confrontation over a place in line for a Pokémon card restock at a GameStop. Authorities arrested two men, alleging one cut in line, leading to a verbal dispute that turned violent. The suspects allegedly struck the victim with a mason jar and then used the broken glass to stab him multiple times. The incident highlights a growing trend of violence associated with the highly profitable Pokémon card resale market, where "scalpers" buy large quantities of cards to resell at a steep markup, often leading to tension among collectors.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has announced it will sever ties with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that the university and the firm misrepresented a cybersecurity "boot camp," misleading students into believing it had close ties to Caltech faculty when the connection was minimal. As part of a settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to new transparency measures and to provide tuition refunds totaling over $2.4 million to hundreds of students. The decision is a notable development in the growing scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online course providers.</p>

          <p>This commentary article criticizes the Trump administration's priorities, as reflected in its latest budget and policy decisions. The author argues that billions are being allocated for increased border enforcement, including ICE raids in places like Los Angeles's MacArthur Park, while funding for vital areas like medical and climate research is being cut. The piece highlights the irony of dismantling the National Institutes of Health and the National Weather Service at a time of increasing health and climate crises. The author contends that these actions are a "political agenda of provoking fear" rather than addressing the nation's real and existential threats.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The VA is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, which has eliminated the need for the planned cuts. The initial proposal, which could have cut over 80,000 jobs to return to 2019 staffing levels, had drawn criticism. While the department framed the reversal as a result of successful improvements, critics argue it reflects an unsustainable loss of employees due to a "toxic work environment."</p>

The new route, W121, is one of three offshoots from the main north-south path and at its closest point lies just 4.2 nautical miles from the strait's unofficial median line. China's Civil Aviation Administration claimed the change was a technical adjustment to improve air traffic safety and efficiency.

The decision highlights a growing global reassessment of the attack helicopter's role on a battlefield saturated with advanced air defenses and cheap loitering munitions.

A new annual report states that criminal gangs are using methods like drones to smuggle contraband to inmates who are often bored and living in overcrowded conditions. A survey found that 39% of prisoners said it was easy to get drugs, and the report highlights "uncontrolled levels of criminality" that inexperienced staff are unable to contain.
