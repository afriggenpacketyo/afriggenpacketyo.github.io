          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that countries without a trade agreement with the Trump administration will face the reimposition of tariffs, originally announced in April, starting August 1. Bessent clarified this is not a new deadline but a firm date for the tariffs to take effect, urging trading partners to finalize negotiations. This follows President Trump's earlier announcement that letters would be sent to notify nations of their tariff rates. The administration suggests that several new trade deals could be announced shortly, ahead of the expiration of a 90-day pause on the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, key figures involved in the 1975 blockbuster "Jaws" are sharing their memories of its notoriously difficult production on Martha's Vineyard. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls initially turning down his role, believing the film would be a failure, while screenwriter Carl Gottlieb discusses adapting the script to create one of cinema's most terrifying experiences. The article explores the on-set tensions, the challenges of filming on the open ocean with a malfunctioning mechanical shark, and how director Steven Spielberg's ingenuity turned a troubled shoot into a cultural phenomenon that launched the summer blockbuster era.</p>

          <p>A Eurostar train traveling from Brussels to London was evacuated in northern France after being stranded for nearly four hours due to a power failure. Passengers reported a lack of air conditioning and non-functional toilets during the extended wait before emergency services arrived with water. Eurostar has apologized for the significant disruption, which extended the two-hour journey to over eight hours. A rescue train was dispatched to collect the stranded passengers, and the company has offered a full refund or a travel voucher as compensation for the difficult experience.</p>

          <p>Two years after a Land Rover crashed into a school's end-of-term tea party in Wimbledon, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls who were killed say they are still fighting for answers. The driver, who claimed to have no memory of the event, was initially not charged after it was determined she likely had an epileptic seizure. However, the investigation was reopened, and she was later rearrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. At a memorial event, the grieving parents and school community expressed their frustration over the prolonged wait for accountability and a clear explanation of the tragedy.</p>

Hassett also discussed the upcoming trade deadline, suggesting that new deals will be finalized and that countries are responding to tariff threats by moving production to the U.S. He dismissed concerns about potential Medicaid coverage losses, stating the bill's work requirements are reasonable and that job creation will lead to more people getting insurance.

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, critics are attributing the scale of the tragedy to President Trump's budget cuts at the National Weather Service and NOAA. Opponents argue these cuts hampered storm prediction capabilities, pointing to warnings from meteorologists about such potential consequences. The White House has denounced these claims as politicizing a tragedy, stating the NWS issued warnings in advance and that the storm's behavior was unpredictable. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledged the nation's flood notification technology is "ancient" and currently being upgraded, while defending the federal response to the disaster.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in northern Peru with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city served as a strategic trading hub, connecting ancient communities from the Pacific coast with those in the Andes and the Amazon. The site, which contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes, is seen as crucial for understanding the fate of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas. This discovery adds to Peru's rich history of major archaeological finds, including Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines.</p>

          <p>In a major development, the U.S. Department of Justice will provide the defense team of a Mexican kingpin with audio recordings of the 1985 torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena. The tapes, which have never been public, are part of the case against Rafael Caro Quintero, a founder of the Guadalajara cartel accused in the killing. The murder of Camarena was a pivotal moment in the U.S. war on drugs. Speculation has long surrounded the tapes, with some believing they may contain evidence of a former CIA officer's involvement in Camarena's interrogation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Originally a gift from France to celebrate the end of slavery, the Statue of Liberty was not initially associated with immigration. This article traces its transformation into a symbol for newcomers, largely influenced by Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus" and the opening of the Ellis Island immigration facility. It explores the political shifts in U.S. immigration policy, from the restrictive ethnic quotas of 1924 to the landmark 1965 act that ended them. The piece reflects on how the statue's meaning was ultimately defined by the millions of immigrants who saw it as a beacon of promise.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Alvarado, Texas, was shot in the neck after responding to a call about a suspicious person outside an ICE detention facility on the Fourth of July. Officials report that upon arrival, officers were fired upon by an unknown number of suspects, several of whom were later taken into custody after attempting to flee. The injured officer was treated at a hospital and has been released. A federal source indicated that over a dozen masked individuals in body armor were involved, vandalizing property and launching fireworks in an apparent attempt to lure law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This analytical article contends that the international response to Israel's war in Gaza is causing a foundational collapse of the post-WWII global order. It argues that the failure to enforce international laws, such as those preventing the bombing of hospitals or the use of starvation as a weapon, is eroding the principles of the system. The piece connects this international breakdown to domestic issues in Western nations, citing the suppression of pro-Palestinian speech on university campuses as an example of how rules are being rewritten to protect powerful interests, ultimately threatening the stability of the entire rules-based order.</p>

          <p>Despite rising trade tensions and political rhetoric at the national level, many local U.S. government officials continue to welcome investment from China. According to a leader from the China General Chamber of Commerce, American city and state leaders are actively seeking Chinese-invested projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. While potential Chinese investors are concerned about the geopolitical climate, the economic benefits and the desire to produce goods within the U.S. to avoid tariffs remain strong motivators. Officials in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly very receptive to such investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A communication expert and executive coach highlights five common phrases that, despite good intentions, can make a person seem judgmental and erode trust. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can come across as dismissive or condescending, while preambles such as "To be honest…" can make others defensive. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking questions, using "yes, and..." to build on ideas, and framing opinions as one perspective among many. The goal is to be mindful of both intent and impact to foster more positive relationships.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans through a strategy that combines religious soft power with major infrastructure projects. The construction of large, Turkish-funded mosques, such as the Namazgah mosque in Albania, is just one element of a broader geopolitical push. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government is also investing heavily in railroads, ports, and hotels across the region, a policy described by one expert as "infrastructure imperialism." This strategy aims to position Turkey as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire, projecting an image of modernity and shared destiny with Balkan nations.</p>

He advocates for a "polluter pays approach," questioning why event organizers who require a police presence for security don't pay for it, thus diverting resources from local communities. The commissioner's comments were part of a broader call for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger ones to better manage resources and confront modern threats amid funding challenges.</p>

          <p>An analysis sparked by a social media debate examines why only a small fraction of the population, estimated at around 5%, owns Bitcoin and what this means for its utility. The discussion reveals a split between those who see Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and those who view it as "digital gold," a store of value. Proponents argue that widespread ownership isn't necessary for it to succeed as a store of value, similar to gold. However, critics contend its value is based purely on speculation, and its infrastructure cannot support widespread use as a daily currency. (not investment advice)</p>
