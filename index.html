          <p>Karla Flores, experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with two chordomas, rare malignant tumors, one on her brain stem and another on her spine. Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a unique surgical plan after an MRI revealed the spinal tumor. The spinal tumor's location made traditional approaches impossible, so Dr. Labib pioneered a "third nostril" approach, accessing the tumor through Flores' eye socket. The successful 20-hour procedure involved removing part of her cheekbone and using a titanium plate to rebuild her eye socket, with Flores now cancer-free after radiation and rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Attorneys representing migrants are appealing to the courts to halt President Trump's employment of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, to expedite deportations. This legal challenge marks the beginning of what is expected to be a pivotal battle concerning the president's aggressive immigration policies.

He emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to its allies and the need for a strong deterrent, while also cautioning against economic ties with China that could be used as leverage.</p>

Experts criticize this as a massive expansion of genetic surveillance and an unjustified invasion of privacy. Since 2020, CBP has added over 1.5 million DNA profiles to the FBI's Codis database, including data from thousands of children and teens.</p>
