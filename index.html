          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is projected to move up the U.S. East Coast, bringing dangerous rip currents and high waves without making direct landfall. Currently a Category 3 storm, Erin is expected to cause coastal flooding, prompting evacuation orders in North Carolina's Outer Banks. Forecasters warn that while the storm's center will remain offshore between Bermuda and the U.S., its large size will generate life-threatening surf conditions for much of the week.</p>

          <p>A review of UK newspaper headlines reveals varied perspectives on the White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, with some outlets highlighting a reconciliation while others remain skeptical about achieving peace. The papers noted the contrast in President Zelenskyy's demeanor and attire compared to a previous, more contentious visit.

          <p>China has unveiled images of a new crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, its first of this type, which combines a helicopter's vertical takeoff capabilities with the higher speed and range of a fixed-wing airplane. The design suggests it is a manned vehicle, though this remains unconfirmed from the photos released. This development places China among the few nations developing such technology, which is noted for its significant mechanical complexity, high costs, and safety concerns, similar to the US V-22 Osprey.</p>

          <p>In a powerful first-person account, an academic in Gaza describes the profound difficulty of continuing intellectual work while facing deliberate starvation and the devastation of war. The writer details the physical and cognitive toll of hunger, the collapse of essential services like banking, and the daily struggle for survival in a besieged environment. Despite these extreme hardships, the article asserts that continuing to teach, research, and write is an act of resistance against erasure and a refusal to be silenced.</p>

The summit focused on establishing security guarantees for Ukraine and arranging future talks with Vladimir Putin, though Trump notably reversed his previous stance on needing a ceasefire first. The unified presence of the European delegation was a key factor in steering the discussions and presenting a coordinated front.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Open has reimagined its mixed doubles event, successfully attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu with a significant increase in prize money and a shorter format. While organizers aim to boost fan interest and create a primetime television spectacle, the changes have drawn sharp criticism from doubles specialists. Critics, including Jamie Murray, argue the new format devalues the Grand Slam title, functioning more like a lucrative exhibition that sidelines dedicated doubles players.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to ban mail-in voting nationwide before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted to achieve this goal. He repeated unsubstantiated claims that the voting method is inherently corrupt and enables fraud. However, legal scholars and the U.S. Constitution indicate that states, not the president, have the primary authority to regulate federal elections, making the legality of such an executive order highly questionable and likely to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Investigation documents recently released by Idaho State Police reveal that Bryan Kohberger exhibited alarming behavior while he was a doctoral student in the months preceding the 2022 University of Idaho murders. Fellow graduate students and faculty members at Washington State University described him as "creepy," "sexist," and condescending, particularly toward women. One professor expressed concern to colleagues that he showed predatory tendencies and would likely harass students if he ever became a professor.</p>

          <p>Japanese technology investment firm SoftBank announced it is purchasing a $2 billion stake in U.S. computer chip manufacturer Intel, a move that caused Intel's shares to rise over 5% in after-hours trading. This major investment comes amid separate reports that the Trump administration is also considering taking an equity stake in the company. Both developments are seen as votes of confidence in Intel's turnaround strategy and efforts to strengthen advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new S&P report, China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with growth accelerating significantly following the U.S.-China trade war. These exports now total around $1.6 trillion, substantially more than China's combined exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. This trend indicates a strategic pivot by Chinese firms toward developing nations to mitigate risks from U.S. tariffs, potentially reshaping global commerce by increasing the importance of South-South trade.

          <p>Indian sailors now represent the largest group of "abandoned seafarers" in the world, a term for crews left stranded by shipowners who fail to pay wages or cover repatriation costs. One Indian crew has been stuck in a Ukrainian war zone since April, unable to leave without forfeiting their salaries. This growing crisis is frequently linked to the practice of registering ships under "flags of convenience" in countries with lax regulations, which obscures true ownership and makes accountability extremely difficult.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the increasing trend of Hong Kong residents seeking medical treatment in mainland China poses a significant long-term threat to the city's own healthcare system. While mainland services can be faster and more affordable, this "unofficial outsourcing" could erode Hong Kong's capacity for medical innovation, talent development, and clinical trials. The author warns that without improvements to the local system, Hong Kong risks hollowing out its healthcare capabilities and market share.</p>

The victims—a 65-year-old woman and two men in their 40s—were found with gunshot wounds inside two separate vehicles on a remote stretch of road. Investigators believe the shooter approached the victims in a car, opened fire, and then fled the scene, leaving no immediate motive.</p>
