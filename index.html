          <p>Seventeen family members of Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of "El Chapo" Guzman, entered the U.S. from Mexico as part of a deal negotiated between Guzman Lopez and the Trump administration, according to Mexico's security chief. Guzman Lopez, who was extradited to the U.S. in 2023, is reportedly cooperating with U.S. authorities and pointing fingers at other criminal organizations. The U.S. Attorney General's Office also announced narcoterrorism charges against top cartel leaders, warning them they are now the hunted.

          <p>Rupert Lowe, formerly a Reform UK MP for Great Yarmouth, will not face criminal charges related to an allegation of threats, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. Lowe had been suspended by the party in March following claims of threats towards the party's chairman. The CPS made the decision after a detailed review of evidence and witness statements, concluding there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

          <p>Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, in an effort to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves fully covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures. The government provides a lump-sum payment, but delivery costs often exceed that amount. Obstetricians have expressed concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

Families can also use income or savings outside the 529 plan to cover immediate college expenses and request reimbursement later. Despite concerns over college costs, college savings accounts remain vital, and recent changes allow for rolling over unused funds to a Roth IRA and using funds for continuing education and student loan payments.

          <p>Goldman Sachs President John Waldron stated that investors have recently trimmed their U.S. dollar holdings, returning to more neutral positions on the currency, rather than a wholesale exit. The move follows market volatility after the Trump administration's tariff policies. Waldron noted that investors had previously been optimistic about the U.S. outperforming the rest of the world, leading to overweight positions in U.S. assets. The recent truce in the U.S.-China trade war has since set off a relief rally in stocks and propelled the dollar higher. (not investment advice)</p>
