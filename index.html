          <p>Colonel Michael Randrianirina has been sworn in as president of Madagascar after leading a military coup. The takeover followed a series of youth-led protests against the previous government and resulted in the ousting of former President Andry Rajoelina, who has since fled the country. This power seizure has drawn international condemnation from both the United Nations and the African Union, with the latter suspending Madagascar's membership in response to the unconstitutional change of government.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to advocate for the provision of long-range Tomahawk missiles. The high-stakes meeting occurs as Trump has also engaged in a "very productive" phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, leading to an agreement for a face-to-face summit in Hungary. This diplomatic maneuvering creates a complex backdrop for Zelensky's visit, as the potential U.S.-Russia dialogue could influence decisions on military aid for Ukraine's defense efforts.</p>

The project was intended to process materials from a mine in Angola, providing the UK with a strategic asset in a market dominated by China. Pensana's chairman cited insufficient UK government financial support compared to more substantial incentives offered by the U.S. government for a similar facility.</p>

The move has sparked a political debate about antisemitism, public safety, and the role of law enforcement in managing events with significant geopolitical sensitivities.</p>

          <p>Three major U.S. labor unions have initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that its program to monitor the social media of visa holders is unconstitutional. The suit claims the government's surveillance, which targets specific viewpoints including criticism of U.S. and Israeli policy, violates First Amendment rights and creates a chilling effect on free speech. The legal action highlights the tension between national security measures and civil liberties, particularly for non-citizens legally residing in the country.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese retailers have launched their Singles' Day sales campaigns in mid-October, nearly a month ahead of the traditional November 11 date. This move is an attempt to boost consumer spending amid a sluggish domestic market affected by a property crisis and high youth unemployment. The extended sales period for what is the country's largest shopping event reflects efforts by e-commerce giants like Alibaba to revive retail growth and counter cautious consumer sentiment.</p>
