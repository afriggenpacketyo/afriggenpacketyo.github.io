        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court in New York has affirmed the $83.3 million judgment against President Donald Trump for defaming former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in 2019. The court firmly rejected Trump's arguments for presidential immunity and that the damages were excessive, asserting he acted with "reckless disregard for the truth" when publicly denying her sexual assault claim. Carroll's attorney highlighted the ruling as a significant vindication of her client's truthfulness and acknowledged the profound harm, including thousands of attacks and death threats, caused by Trump's statements. This decision reinforces legal accountability, following a separate 2023 trial where Trump was found liable for sexual assault and a distinct act of defamation, resulting in a $5 million award.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With Americans facing record debt and high credit card APRs, many are exploring debt relief strategies to manage significant financial strain. This article explains debt relief as a comprehensive financial reset, offering various tools such as debt consolidation, credit counseling, debt settlement, and bankruptcy. Each approach carries distinct costs, timeframes, and consequences for one's credit score and financial future, necessitating careful consideration. Debt relief can be particularly beneficial when high-rate debts are overwhelming or income disruptions make traditional repayment difficult, but it demands a thorough assessment of one's overall financial picture and potential long-term impacts.

          <p>Germany commemorates the 25th anniversary of the murder of Enver Simsek, the first victim of the National Socialist Underground (NSU), a neo-Nazi terror group. Simsek, a Turkish-born florist, was fatally shot in 2000, with his family enduring over a decade of suspicion from investigators before the NSU's racist motives were finally uncovered in 2011. His daughter, Semiya, still actively seeks answers regarding the profound systemic failures that allowed the NSU to operate for seven years, murdering ten people of non-German origin, including her father. The ongoing quest for truth underscores Germany's persistent struggle to confront its past and ensure comprehensive justice for victims of right-wing extremism.</p>

          <p>Robinhood shares surged over 14% following S&P Global's announcement of the online brokerage's long-anticipated inclusion in the S&P 500 index. This significant development, effective September 22, will see Robinhood replace Caesars Entertainment and is expected to trigger substantial buying from passive funds tracking the index. Robinhood's stock has experienced a remarkable turnaround, climbing over 210% year-to-date, largely benefiting from increased interest in cryptocurrency and a more favorable regulatory environment under the current administration. The company's addition to this benchmark index represents a major milestone after previous postponements and early struggles post-IPO, reflecting its recent profitability and market performance.

Speaking at a popular folk festival, Söder, who leads the conservative Christian Social Union, rejected calls for an outright ban on the AfD, fearing such a move would inadvertently create a "martyr status" for the group. He underscored that many AfD politicians are currently under observation by domestic intelligence, which classifies the party as a suspected far-right extremist organization. Conversely, AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla expressed confidence in winning the 2029 federal election, advocating for mass deportations and sharply criticizing the current government's policies.</p>

          <p>China's export growth slowed significantly in August, registering a 4.4% increase compared to the same month last year, marking the weakest pace since the start of the year. Imports, meanwhile, saw a modest 1.8% rise. This slowdown occurs amid persistent trade tensions with major partners like the U.S., where President Trump's administration has imposed 30% additional tariffs on Chinese imports. Consequently, Chinese exports to the U.S. plummeted 33% in August, and imports from the U.S. dropped 16%, highlighting the tangible impact of these trade disputes. The article also touches on China's crucial role in rare earth exports and recent agreements aimed at de-escalating some trade restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

This potential coordinated action with Five Eyes allies aims to exert pressure on non-compliant countries to accept their citizens.

Banksy authenticated the work via Instagram, captioning it "Royal Courts Of Justice. London." While the Metropolitan Police are investigating it as criminal damage, a Labour peer suggested the piece serves as a protest about the law, consistent with Banksy's history of using art to critique government policy, war, and capitalism.</p>

          <p>With a slowing job market and rising unemployment, many Americans are concerned about managing student loans after experiencing job loss. This article outlines key strategies for federal student loan borrowers, including income-driven repayment (IDR) plans that can reduce monthly payments, potentially to as low as $0, based on current earnings. Borrowers may also qualify for an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment, allowing for temporary payment pauses, though it's crucial to understand if interest will still accrue during these periods. Experts advise providing proof of current income if it has recently dropped and exploring available options with private lenders, as the ultimate goal is to prevent financial crises and build sustainable financial habits.

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals a significant and persistent shift in American attitudes towards socialism and capitalism, particularly pronounced among Democrats. While U.S. adults overall still lean towards a positive view of capitalism, only 42% of Democrats view it favorably, contrasting sharply with 66% who hold a positive view of socialism. This gradual reorientation over the past 15 years, especially among younger Democrats, reflects growing concerns about economic unfairness rather than a complete rejection of free enterprise. The findings highlight deep ideological divisions within the Democratic party regarding the embrace of socialist ideas, posing a conundrum for politicians who are increasingly finding appeal for these concepts within their base.</p>

          <p>With elevated interest rates and high home prices, many homeowners are considering leveraging their substantial home equity, which averages around $313,000, for greater financial flexibility. This article outlines smart and strategic uses, such as funding value-boosting home renovations that increase property value or consolidating high-interest credit card debt, provided the borrower maintains financial discipline. Conversely, risky uses to avoid include speculative investing, using equity to fund an unsustainable lifestyle by repeatedly accruing new credit card debt, or making only minimum payments on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), which can lead to significant long-term financial pitfalls. Experts strongly advise due diligence and a clear, beneficial purpose to avoid jeopardizing one's financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has strongly asserted that the party's next deputy leader, replacing Angela Rayner, must be a woman from outside London to effectively broaden the leadership's national reach. The party's ruling National Executive Committee has established a sped-up schedule for the deputy leadership race, with nominations opening shortly and a winner slated to be announced by October 25. Prospective candidates are required to secure significant backing from at least 80 MPs, as well as support from local parties or affiliated groups. Harman, expressing disappointment at Rayner's departure, emphasized the critical need for a complementary figure to galvanize the party, amidst ongoing calls for greater regional balance within the cabinet.</p>

          <p>A spectacular "blood moon" graced the night skies this week, captivating observers across Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa during a total lunar eclipse. This stunning celestial phenomenon occurs when Earth positions itself directly between the sun and the moon, causing sunlight to filter through the edges of Earth's atmosphere and cast a distinctive red glow onto the lunar surface. NASA clarifies that the term "blood moon" can also describe the moon's reddish hue caused by atmospheric haze, smoke, or dust, though this event was a true eclipse. The next total lunar eclipse visible in the Americas is anticipated in March, promising another opportunity for skygazers to witness this dazzling event.</p>

          <p>Manchester City and the Premier League have reached a settlement in their dispute concerning the rules that govern associated party transactions (APT). Manchester City has now accepted that the APT rules, which are designed to prevent clubs from unfairly profiting from commercial deals with companies linked to their owners beyond "fair market value," are valid and binding. This settlement effectively ends City's legal challenge against the Premier League, which had previously seen an independent arbitration panel rule against certain aspects of the regulations. Both parties issued a joint statement confirming no further comment, concluding a contentious issue that had seen a majority of top-flight clubs vote to approve amendments to the APTs despite City's initial opposition.</p>

          <p>Brazil is deeply divided as the verdict approaches in the coup trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who stands accused of attempting to cling to power after losing the 2022 election. Bolsonaro vehemently denies the charges, which include proposing a coup to military commanders and inciting supporters to attack government buildings, labeling them politically motivated—a stance echoed by U.S. President Donald Trump, who imposed tariffs on Brazilian goods. Rival rallies on Brazil's Independence Day showcased the country's profound polarization, with supporters demanding amnesty and critics calling for accountability. This trial has reignited intense debates about Brazil's young democracy and the Supreme Court's controversial, yet crucial, role in prosecuting perceived threats to it.</p>

Overcrowding in mountain destinations, as people seek to escape warmer temperatures, further exacerbates the risks for inexperienced hikers. The surge in deaths highlights immediate dangers for outdoor enthusiasts and broader environmental concerns, as shrinking glaciers contribute to sea level rise and intensify extreme weather events, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive climate action.</p>

Prosecutors allege Routh meticulously planned the attack for months, acquiring a military-grade rifle and extensively researching Trump's movements. Routh's defense, according to court filings, centers on his character to prove a lack of intent, despite his unconventional legal tactics and previous bizarre requests, including a "beatdown session" with Trump.</p>

The investigation began when corrections deputies noticed suspicious stains on papers Casals brought for inmates, which later tested positive for cannabinoids.
