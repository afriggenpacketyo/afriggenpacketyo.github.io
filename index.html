          <p>President Trump announced that ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are set to commence immediately following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and subsequent discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders. Trump expressed confidence in reaching a deal, citing the involvement of significant egos but believing Putin desires to end the conflict. He also mentioned the Vatican's interest in hosting the negotiations, suggesting it could help alleviate bitterness. The article notes Trump's earlier promise to end the war within 24 hours of taking office and continued strikes inside Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has agreed to compensate hundreds of former sub-postmasters after a data breach accidentally leaked their names and addresses on its corporate website, a mistake described by the then-Post Office chief executive as a "truly terrible error". Individual payouts of up to £5,000 will be provided, with the potential for higher sums for those pursuing further claims. The law firm Freeths secured the payouts on behalf of affected sub-postmasters, many of whom were already involved in a separate battle for compensation related to the Horizon IT scandal. Chris Head, a former sub-postmaster, expressed relief but noted the prolonged effort required to address the issue.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) provided an initial update on the investigation into the Mexican navy ship Cuauhtémoc's collision with the Brooklyn Bridge. The investigation will include examining the crew, vessel, and environmental conditions at the time of the incident, which resulted in two fatalities and multiple injuries. The NTSB timeline indicates the ship began backing away from the dock with tugboat assistance before requesting additional tugboats and subsequently striking the bridge. The NTSB is working with the Mexican government to access the ship and investigate its engines, and they have determined the bridge is structurally safe.</p>

          <p>Portugal's center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) secured a victory in the recent elections, but the far-right Chega party made significant gains, emerging as a joint second political force alongside the Socialists.

The result mirrors trends seen in other European countries, with a rightward shift gaining momentum.

          <p>Kim Kardashian's recent appearance in a Paris courtroom, adorned with millions of dollars in diamonds, marks a reclamation of her freedom and identity following a traumatic robbery in 2016. The article contrasts the current media response with the victim-blaming that Kardashian faced after the robbery, highlighting a shift towards greater sensitivity towards female celebrities. Kardashian's choice to wear extravagant jewelry is interpreted as a deliberate act of reclaiming her narrative and defying past criticisms of conspicuous consumption. The article suggests that Kardashian has successfully rebuilt her brand and influence, demonstrating that there is no such thing as being "too public" about your wealth in today's media landscape.</p>

These fiscal conservatives are demanding deeper cuts to federal programs like Medicaid and food assistance. While the bill advanced past a critical hurdle, its fate remains uncertain as Republican leaders negotiate with both anti-deficit conservatives and moderate Republicans wary of cutting social programs.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement that former President Joe Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, oncology experts explained why the diagnosis may have occurred relatively late. Factors include the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendations against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older, the possibility that the cancer grew rapidly between screenings, or that screening results were borderline. Experts emphasize that it is common for patients with advanced prostate cancer to be asymptomatic, and shared decision-making between patients and physicians is crucial in determining screening and treatment options.</p>

The 14-story Art Moderne building, designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, housed federal courts and agencies before a new courthouse opened nearby in 2016. Real estate experts estimate the property could sell for around $60 million, attracting interest from wealthy individuals or family offices willing to redevelop the site, possibly into apartments.

          <p>This New York Times article reports that a Delaware animal shelter is struggling to care for thousands of chicks found abandoned in a United States Postal Service truck. The chicks, part of a routine shipment from a Pennsylvania hatchery, were left without water, food, or temperature control, resulting in the deaths of 4,000 birds. The Freedom Ranger Hatchery expressed frustration with the Postal Service's failure to deliver the chicks to their intended destinations, and the shelter is seeking assistance from the community to care for the surviving birds.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is considering a controversial plea deal for an L.A. County sheriff's deputy, Trevor Kirk, convicted of using excessive force against an unarmed woman, which would spare him prison time. The judge grilled the prosecutor on the unusual decision to offer a misdemeanor plea after a felony conviction, raising concerns about the government's rationale. The plea deal has caused turmoil within the U.S. attorney's office, with multiple prosecutors resigning in protest.

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage has climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to concerns about rising government debt. This increase, the first since April 11, is attributed to the 10-year Treasury bond's sensitivity to economic conditions. Elevated mortgage rates, coupled with a shortage of affordable properties, continue to challenge aspiring homebuyers. The article notes that only a small percentage of listed homes are affordable for households with a $75,000 annual income, compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

She also believes the U.S. is entering a more innovation-friendly environment, which will further boost overlooked sectors.
