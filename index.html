          <p>Deadly wildfires are blazing across Europe, with firefighters battling major fronts in several countries. In Greece, crews have made some progress against fires threatening cities like Patras, while authorities ordered evacuations of a hospital and retirement home. The crisis is stretching resources thin across the continent, with Albania and Turkey reporting deaths, including forestry workers and civilians. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also honored a fallen volunteer firefighter as thousands have been displaced across the region. The European Union is actively assisting by deploying aircraft and crews to affected nations.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has provided details for the upcoming U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, where President Trump and Vladimir Putin will primarily discuss the war in Ukraine and economic cooperation. The meeting follows a virtual conference where Trump assured Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders that achieving a ceasefire would be a priority. In response, Zelenskyy met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to solidify Western alignment on peace terms, emphasizing that any deal must protect Ukraine's territorial integrity. Despite these diplomatic efforts, some Ukrainians remain skeptical that the summit will produce a meaningful resolution to the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>A Chinese Su-30 fighter jet reportedly performed dangerous maneuvers near a Philippine coastguard plane over the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Onboard footage from the Philippine Cessna aircraft appeared to show the missile-equipped Chinese jet tailing it at close proximity for approximately 20 minutes. The incident occurred while People's Liberation Army Navy ships in the area issued repeated radio challenges. A communication from a U.S. Navy vessel was also reportedly heard during the encounter, highlighting the ongoing military tensions in the contested maritime region.</p>

A Deloitte report found the average daily cost of a packed lunch has risen to $6.15, a 3% increase from last year, with overall grocery costs up 20% from five years ago. Another study suggests that President Trump's tariff agenda could add nearly $163 per year to the cost of school lunch staples. School-provided lunches are also more expensive due to rising food and labor costs, leaving parents squeezed financially from multiple directions.</p>

          <p>Despite a resurgence in film photography driven by Gen Z, the Eastman Kodak Company is facing significant financial difficulties. The 133-year-old company reported a net loss of $26 million and stated in a filing that its finances raise "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operations due to looming debt obligations. This financial struggle presents a paradox, as demand for Kodak's film products has been high enough to necessitate factory upgrades. While the retro trend has created a new market, Kodak's historical inability to adapt to digital technology continues to cast a shadow over its long-term viability.</p>

          <p>Hulu's new series, "The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox," re-examines the infamous murder case of Meredith Kercher from Knox's point of view, with Knox herself serving as a co-producer. The show uses unconventional tonal shifts, blending quirky aesthetics with the grim reality of her interrogation and imprisonment, to tell her story. However, the article argues that by focusing so closely on Knox's personal experience, the docudrama downplays the crucial role the media played in shaping public perception and influencing the trial. Critics suggest this narrative choice omits a key element of why the case became so convoluted and internationally sensationalized.</p>

          <p>A severe cholera outbreak in Sudan, exacerbated by the ongoing civil war, has led to nearly 100,000 suspected cases and over 2,470 deaths in the past year, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The crisis is particularly acute in the Darfur region, where fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, leading to extreme water shortages and forcing them to use contaminated sources. Treatment facilities are overwhelmed, with one hospital in Tawila accommodating 400 patients in a 130-bed center.

The plan has drawn fierce international opposition for decades, as settlements are considered illegal under international law. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the announcement as an extension of annexation, while the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now warned it deepens the conflict.</p>

This move, which initially federalized the local police and deployed National Guard troops for 30 days, is part of a stated effort to crack down on crime in the nation's capital. Trump stated he would ask Congress for an extension, arguing it is necessary to make the city "crime-free" and a "beacon" for the country.

          <p>A growing number of Western nations, including Australia, the UK, and France, have signaled their intent to recognize a Palestinian state, a move that is largely symbolic but carries significant political weight. This article explains that while 147 of 193 UN members already recognize Palestine, formal recognition from major Western powers would further isolate Israel and pressure the U.S. to shift its stance. Legally, statehood allows Palestine to join international bodies like the International Criminal Court, which is how the ICC gained jurisdiction to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. However, critics argue these recognitions are often conditional and do not guarantee a fully sovereign or viable state.</p>

          <p>Residents in Fort Collins, Colorado, have spotted cottontail rabbits with strange, horn-like growths, but wildlife officials say there is no cause for alarm. The rabbits are infected with Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus that causes wart-like tumors on their faces. The virus, which is spread by fleas and ticks, cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals. Experts believe this virus likely inspired the folklore of the jackalope and note that an infected rabbit's immune system can typically fight off the virus, causing the growths to disappear over time.</p>

This financial strain is attributed to a combination of rising living costs, stagnant real wage growth, and a cultural shift towards prioritizing experiences and lifestyle over long-term savings. Experts note that while structural factors like expensive housing and a reliance on imports make saving difficult, aspirational spending and the use of 'buy now, pay later' services also contribute to the trend.

          <h2>Trump's D.C. Police Takeover Recalls a 1992 Incident When Crime Was Far Higher</h2>

          <p>President Trump's federal takeover of the D.C. police is drawing historical comparisons to a 1992 incident, but with a key difference: the level of crime. In 1992, the murder of a congressional staffer prompted Senator Richard Shelby to push for the death penalty in a city then known as the nation's murder capital, with 482 homicides in the previous year. Today, Trump is justifying his actions by citing recent attacks, yet violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, with 187 homicides last year. This contrast highlights how the current federal intervention is occurring in a vastly different public safety environment than the one that sparked similar political outrage three decades ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are preparing a legislative effort to redraw the state's congressional maps, a direct response to a Republican plan in Texas to gerrymander five Democratic-held districts. This bi-coastal political battle could significantly influence control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections. While Texas Republicans can redraw maps through a standard legislative process, California Democrats face a tougher path, likely requiring a constitutional amendment approved by a two-thirds legislative vote and a statewide ballot measure. The move signals an escalation in the partisan fight over redistricting between election cycles.</p>

          <p>More than 160 workers at Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine campus, who create cinematics and other narrative content, have voted to unionize, joining the Communications Workers of America. This move is part of a growing labor movement within the video game industry, driven by concerns over job insecurity, crunch-time hours, and frequent layoffs. The vote proceeded smoothly due to a labor neutrality agreement with parent company Microsoft, which has allowed thousands of its gaming studio employees to organize more easily. This marks another significant step for unionization at a major U.S. gaming company.</p>

          <p>After the Eaton fire destroyed the Altadena home and studio of the late, influential assemblage artist John Outterbridge, his daughter Tami has launched a project to salvage what remains. Called "Diggin' Bridge," the effort invites artists who knew her father to excavate the site, find remnants of his work and materials, and create new pieces in his spirit. The project serves as a living tribute to Outterbridge, a key figure in Southern California's Black Arts Movement known for creating art from discarded objects. Despite the devastation, the collaborative effort has unearthed treasures and fostered a sense of community and continuity.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's preoccupation with lavish makeovers of the White House, Air Force One, and the Kennedy Center is a metaphor for a broader, more consequential transformation of the U.S. government. The author points to recent actions, such as federalizing D.C. police for a "beautification" effort, vetting Smithsonian museums to fit his historical vision, and holding a summit with Putin for show, as evidence of this trend. The article contends that Trump prioritizes the appearance of power and grandeur over substantive governance, using emergency declarations to bypass Congress and reshape institutions in his own image.</p>

This effort aims to ensure access to diverse and often-challenged materials, particularly those featuring LGBTQIA+ content and themes of sexual assault. The initiative serves as a direct countermeasure to political movements seeking to limit library collections.</p>

While maintaining its core identity, the platform is leaning more into the mystery genre to provide a rationale for featuring U.S. stars.

          <p>A new documentary series revisits a pivotal moment in Los Angeles architecture by reuniting key figures from the rebellious 1980s Venice Beach art scene. The series, "Rebel Architects," is inspired by a 1980 photograph featuring architects like Frank Gehry, Thom Mayne, and Eric Owen Moss, who were then challenging establishment norms. Four of the surviving architects gather to recreate the photo and discuss their early careers, the creative freedom of that era, and the evolution of L.A. since. The conversation explores their camaraderie, rivalries, and the scrappy, collaborative energy that briefly placed Los Angeles at the center of the architectural world.</p>

          <p>A 1965 U.S. government program called A-TEAM (Athletes in Temporary Employment as Agricultural Manpower) attempted to recruit high school athletes to replace Mexican farmworkers after the end of the bracero program. The initiative was a widely considered a disaster, as most of the 3,000 teen participants quit or went on strike due to the grueling conditions and low pay. The story is resurfacing as some politicians today suggest American citizens could fill farm labor roles in the event of mass deportations. One former participant reflects on the experience, stating it gave him a lifelong appreciation for the difficulty of the work performed by migrant laborers.</p>

          <p>California's signature cap-and-trade program, a cornerstone of its climate policy, is at the center of a major political battle as lawmakers debate its extension beyond 2030. Governor Newsom is pushing to reauthorize the program, which generates billions in revenue by requiring polluters to buy allowances for their emissions. However, critics from environmental groups argue the program needs significant reforms, claiming the emissions cap is too weak and that too many free credits are given to polluters. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry is pushing back against stricter rules, creating a high-stakes negotiation over the future of the state's climate strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

While L.A. officials insist they will focus on local housing solutions, the administration's aggressive stance and threats to deploy the military have raised alarms about a potential conflict over how to handle the city's significant homeless population during the international event.</p>

A 95-year-old former member of Unit 731's Youth Corps recounted seeing human organ specimens and being ordered to dispose of victims' remains. After the war, the U.S. granted immunity to the unit's leaders in exchange for their research data, a decision that allowed many to escape prosecution for war crimes.</p>
