The 16-page draft order, which is not dated but appears to be prepared for President Donald Trump's signature, would dramatically upend the department if it is enacted — shuttering American embassies across Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus that work on issues like democracy and human rights, as well as international organizations like the United Nations. The draft order also calls for the termination of offices and positions within the department focused on climate, women's issues, democracy, human rights, migration and criminal justice.
