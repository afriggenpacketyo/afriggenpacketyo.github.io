          <p>Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. attorney for Virginia's Eastern District, has resigned from his position. The move comes after reports that federal prosecutors were concerned he could be fired for not prosecuting New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. President Trump confirmed his desire for Siebert's removal, citing his confirmation support from Democratic senators. The resignation leaves a significant prosecutorial office without confirmed leadership, raising concerns about political pressure on the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he ordered a "lethal kinetic strike" on a vessel in international waters allegedly linked to a designated terrorist organization and involved in drug trafficking. The strike, which was shown in a video released by the president, resulted in the deaths of three individuals described as "narco-terrorists." This action is part of a series of recent military strikes against what the administration has labeled narco-terrorist groups, particularly those operating in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility.</p>

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump to revoke television network licenses over critical coverage have raised questions about the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) powers. The FCC, an independent agency, is responsible for issuing broadcasting licenses to local TV and radio stations, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." While it does not directly regulate national networks or cable channels, its control over license transfers gives it significant influence. Experts note that while the FCC has broad leeway, revoking a license over political content is an unprecedented and legally contentious issue.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning TikTok's U.S. operations, though Chinese state media presented a more tentative outlook. The proposed agreement would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to American investors, potentially including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating while licensing algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Discussions continue amid concerns from U.S. lawmakers about Chinese influence over the platform's powerful algorithm. The leaders also plan to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old grandmother who has lived in California for over three decades, has caused shock within the Sikh community. Kaur, who had unsuccessfully applied for asylum and had been reporting to immigration authorities for years, was detained during a routine check-in. Her case highlights the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown, which critics say targets long-term residents without criminal records. Lawmakers are now calling for her release, while ICE maintains she has exhausted all legal remedies and is subject to a removal order.</p>

          <p>A short-term government funding bill passed by the Republican-led House failed to advance in the Senate, leaving no clear path to avoid a shutdown before the October 1 deadline. The GOP measure, which would fund the government until November 21, was blocked by Senate Democrats who opposed the lack of negotiation on their priorities, particularly healthcare provisions. With lawmakers leaving Washington for a recess, the stalemate raises the likelihood of a funding lapse, which President Trump acknowledged could lead to a "closed country for a period of time."</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend but is expected to remain over open waters. While its current track keeps it away from the Caribbean islands and the U.S. mainland, forecasters are monitoring its path as it could pass east of Bermuda next week. The season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

While stating he was "thrilled" Kimmel was off the air, Cruz warned that using government power to regulate speech sets a dangerous precedent that could be used against conservatives in the future.

          <p>Russia is launching Intervision 2025, a revival of a Soviet-era song contest, positioned as an alternative to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the invasion of Ukraine. The contest features 23 countries, primarily Russian allies from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, including China, Brazil, and South Africa. The Kremlin-backed event is seen by critics as a political project to demonstrate that Russia is not isolated on the world stage. The contest emphasizes traditional culture and family values, contrasting with the more modern style often associated with Eurovision.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. tech companies, including Nvidia and Microsoft, have announced tens of billions of pounds in new UK investments, signaling strong confidence in the country's potential as an "AI superpower." The announcements, made during President Trump's state visit, focus on expanding AI infrastructure and data centers, with tech leaders praising the UK's history of scientific research. While some critics worry about over-reliance on U.S. tech, the influx of capital is seen as a significant boost that could help define the UK economy for decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Clashes erupted outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago when federal agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse around 100 demonstrators. The protesters, including two Democratic congressional candidates, were attempting to block government vehicles during an immigration crackdown dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz." At least three arrests were made as masked homeland security agents in riot gear confronted the crowd. Officials described the law enforcement response as a "violent abuse of power," while DHS claimed the protesters were impeding operations and siding with criminals.</p>

          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests that largely ban unauthorized overnight encampments and the use of masks during policy violations. While some rules align with Trump administration demands to crack down on demonstrations, such as a ban on protests at Royce Quad, others expand free speech zones and permit preapproved overnight events. The policies were announced amid pressure from the federal government over the university's handling of past pro-Palestinian protests. University officials state the guidelines are content-neutral and aim to balance free expression with campus safety and operations.</p>

          <p>Estonia has invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty to request urgent consultations with allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes. The Estonian foreign ministry condemned the incursion over the Gulf of Finland as "brazen," and NATO confirmed its jets intercepted the Russian aircraft. This is the second time in a week a NATO member has triggered Article 4 due to Russian military activity, following a similar request from Poland. The incident has heightened tensions on NATO's eastern flank, with leaders calling for a united and strong response.</p>
