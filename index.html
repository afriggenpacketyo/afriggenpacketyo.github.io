          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs, questioning why data on their effectiveness is not more widely shared with the public. His remarks, posted on social media, come amid significant leadership turmoil at the CDC and a recent FDA decision to limit new vaccine approvals to high-risk groups. Trump connected the issue to the ongoing public health debate involving HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the CDC's future direction.</p>

          <p>An analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data shows that the number of immigrant workers in the United States has declined by 1.2 million during the first seven months of the year. This reduction aligns with the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies and a notable slowdown in the overall flow of immigrants into the country. Economists suggest this trend could create challenges for sectors that are heavily dependent on foreign labor, such as agriculture, construction, and healthcare. (not investment advice)</p>
