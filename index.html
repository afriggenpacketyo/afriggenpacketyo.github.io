          <p>This article addresses recent claims by the Trump administration linking the painkiller Tylenol to rising autism rates. It consults with medical experts and researchers who state there is no scientific evidence to support a causal relationship, emphasizing that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with polygenetic origins. The piece also clarifies that the increase in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to improved diagnostic methods and greater public awareness, while reiterating the thoroughly debunked nature of any link between vaccines and autism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England has introduced a new guideline called 'Jess's Rule,' urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient presents with the same symptoms three times without improvement. The initiative is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from undiagnosed cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. This rule, supported by the Royal College of General Practitioners, aims to prevent diagnostic misses, particularly in younger patients whose serious illnesses are sometimes overlooked, thereby improving patient safety and preventing similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>Provisional results from Guinea's constitutional referendum show over 90% of voters in favor of adopting a new constitution. The proposed changes could allow the current military leader, General Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup, to run for president. The new constitution also extends presidential terms and makes it more difficult for political parties to contest elections. Major opposition leaders called for a boycott of the vote, leading to a largely one-sided campaign and raising concerns from the UN about the inclusiveness and transparency of the process.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have made unproven claims suggesting a link between the painkiller Tylenol (acetaminophen) and autism, advising that it should not be prescribed to pregnant women. This announcement has been met with strong criticism from leading medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who assert that the claim is not supported by scientific evidence. Health experts emphasize that acetaminophen remains one of the only safe pain relief options for pregnant women and warn that such statements could pose a health risk.</p>

          <p>Shares for the Danish renewable energy firm Orsted experienced a significant surge of over 7% on Tuesday. This market enthusiasm followed a U.S. court decision that overturned a block previously imposed by the Trump administration, allowing Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project. Located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, the offshore wind farm is a key project for the company in the American market.

          <p>Algerian writer Kamel Daoud, now living under police protection in France, discusses his new novel "Houris," which explores the massacres and torture of the Algerian civil war in the 1990s. The book, which won France's prestigious Prix Goncourt, is banned in Algeria, where a "national reconciliation" law forbids discussing the conflict. Daoud's work focuses on the immense suffering of women during the war, a perspective he says has made him an enemy of Islamists, the Algerian regime, and some intellectuals. He faces international arrest warrants from Algeria and continues to write despite the significant personal danger.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Disney and ABC's decision to reinstate late-night host Jimmy Kimmel was inevitable due to a significant public relations backlash following his suspension. The suspension came after Kimmel made insensitive comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted pressure from the FCC. However, the network's move was widely condemned as an attack on free speech by celebrities and public figures, creating an untenable situation for the company. The author concludes that while Kimmel emerges as a winner, Disney, ABC, and the FCC have been damaged by the debacle.</p>

Forty years ago, European captain Tony Jacklin implemented significant changes, demanding better travel, attire, and team facilities to professionalize the European effort and instill a winning mentality. These reforms, combined with the inclusion of talents like Seve Ballesteros, led to a narrow loss in 1983 and a historic victory at The Belfry in 1985, ending a 28-year U.S. unbeaten streak. That win is credited with transforming the Ryder Cup into the highly competitive and popular global event it is today.</p>

          <p>This article explores how modern football tactics, such as an increased emphasis on set-pieces and direct, long-ball play, are reminiscent of the style famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce, once criticized for his methods, notes that many top clubs are now adopting strategies he pioneered, including using a big target-man striker and prioritizing forward passes over a possession-based game. The piece highlights a shift away from playing out from the back, with data showing more goals are now being scored from set-pieces. Allardyce suggests that coaches are becoming less fearful of criticism and more willing to innovate.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation provides a rare look inside UK hotels used to house asylum seekers, revealing unsafe and challenging living conditions. The report details families cooking meals in shower trays due to inedible hotel food, creating fire hazards, and children living in cramped spaces for years while their cases are processed. It also uncovers evidence of residents working illegally to supplement their small government allowance and an inefficient system reliant on expensive, long-distance taxi journeys for appointments. These findings come as the government pledges to phase out the use of such hotels by 2029.</p>

          <p>Tuesday's UK newspaper headlines focus on multiple key stories, including widespread condemnation of Nigel Farage's proposal to deport some legal migrants, which critics are calling divisive and radical. Several papers also cover the reassurance from UK health officials regarding the safety of paracetamol for pregnant women, following President Trump's unsubstantiated claims linking the drug to autism. Additionally, the Royal Family is under scrutiny, with headlines questioning the future role of the Duchess of York due to her ties to Jeffrey Epstein. The papers also discuss a think tank's proposal for tax changes in the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, is in federal custody after allegedly firing at least three rounds into the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. No injuries were reported in the drive-by shooting. After being briefly released on bail for local charges, the suspect was rearrested by the FBI on federal charges of interfering with a radio communications station. A handwritten note found reportedly referenced FBI officials and Jeffrey Epstein, and also mentioned not supporting media figures.

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reflects on her unsuccessful presidential campaign, detailing several pivotal moments. She recounts a distracting pre-debate phone call from then-President Biden, which she felt was self-serving and rattled her. Harris also reveals that while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was her first choice for a running mate, she considered their combined identities a political liability. Additionally, she expresses regret over a gaffe on "The View," where she couldn't name anything she would do differently than Biden, an answer she admits was a gift to the Trump campaign.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Sean "Diddy" Combs have asked a federal judge to sentence him to no more than 14 months for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, which would result in his immediate release. In a court filing, his lawyers argue that Combs has been sufficiently punished, citing the destruction of his career and legacy, and the harrowing conditions he has faced in jail for nearly 13 months. The submission details how his businesses have been dismantled and his family has suffered. Prosecutors are expected to recommend a substantially longer sentence ahead of his sentencing on October 3.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese buyers have secured at least 10 cargoes of soybeans from Argentina after Buenos Aires temporarily eliminated its grain export taxes. This move makes Argentine soybeans more competitive and provides China with an alternative source for its fourth-quarter supply, a period typically dominated by U.S. shipments. The deals are a significant setback for American farmers, who have been largely excluded from the Chinese market due to the ongoing trade war and are already contending with low prices. The temporary tax suspension in Argentina is expected to last through October or until a specific export value is reached. (not investment advice)</p>

Abdel Fattah had been sentenced to five years for "spreading false news." His release follows a long campaign by his family, including an extensive hunger strike by his mother, and widespread international pressure from human rights groups and the UK government.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Europe is in a precarious diplomatic position, caught between an unreliable U.S. and a strategic rival in China. With the transatlantic relationship unmoored under the Trump administration, Europe's traditionally U.S.-aligned China policy is no longer viable. The author contends that Europe must now define its own stance on issues like trade, technology, and security, particularly regarding China's implicit support for Russia in the Ukraine war. China views Europe through the lens of its competition with the U.S., making it difficult for Europe to navigate its security interests without being drawn into superpower conflicts.</p>

Detroit controlled the game physically, outrushing Baltimore 224 to 85 yards and executing long, methodical scoring drives. Despite a late touchdown from Baltimore, a failed two-point conversion and onside kick allowed the Lions to seal the victory, moving them to a 2-1 record for the season.</p>
