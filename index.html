          <p>England is preparing for a crucial Women's Six Nations match against France, a team that nearly defeated them in 2023 with a strong second-half performance. The English team aims to secure a Grand Slam victory by focusing on accurate kicking to contain France's attacking flair, especially from scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Coach Mitchell emphasizes the need to counter France's tactical kicking game, and fly-half Zoe Harrison's kicking skills will be pivotal in controlling territory. Former player Katy Daley-Mclean highlights the importance of a strong kicking game to pressure France and prevent them from dominating in the 22.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, shortly after Walczak received an 18-month prison sentence for tax crimes involving the misuse of funds for personal luxuries. Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, played a role in attempts to publicize Ashley Biden’s diary during the 2020 election, hoping to undermine Joseph R. Biden Jr. Fago was contacted by someone in possession of the diary, which contained sensitive details about Ashley Biden’s recovery from addiction, adding a layer of political intrigue to the pardon.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has voiced concerns over the deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras by the Trump administration, potentially against the wishes of the child's father. Judge Terry A. Doughty questioned the legality and constitutionality of deporting a U.S. citizen, even with the mother's consent, and has scheduled a hearing to investigate whether the government circumvented due process. The judge asserted a 'strong suspicion' that the government deported the child without meaningful process, highlighting the complexities and potential violations of rights in immigration cases involving U.S. citizens.</p>

          <p>Westinghouse, a US nuclear giant, has withdrawn from the UK's small modular reactor (SMR) design competition, leaving only three finalists: Rolls-Royce, GE-Hitachi, and Holtec. The withdrawal may be due to concerns over the government's commercial offer, with potential savings leading to only one company being awarded a contract. Supporters of SMRs claim they could revolutionize nuclear power by reducing building times and costs, but there are fears that their economics may be difficult to justify due to lower electricity production and similar security and waste disposal issues as larger reactors.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have pledged to agree on a peace plan by May 2, signing an agreement to respect each other's sovereignty. The agreement was facilitated by the U.S. Secretary of State in Washington, aiming to address the conflict in eastern DR Congo where Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized territory. This agreement comes after the DR Congo sought assistance from the U.S. in exchange for mineral access.</p>
