          <p>Index funds, which have long dominated the market, are seeing a resurgence of active management, with actively managed ETFs experiencing net inflows while index funds see outflows. This trend marks a potential transformation in the ETF space, with a record number of new ETFs launching this year and active ETFs now rivaling index ETFs in number. Investors are advised to consider factors like R-squared to assess a fund's active nature and to avoid panic trading during market volatility, remembering that time in the market is more important than timing the market. This shift is also driven by younger retail investors and the increasing use of active ETFs by registered investment advisors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of US arts organizations have been notified that government grant offers have been terminated, following Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The proposed eliminations are part of the administration's 2026 discretionary budget request, aiming to decrease the size of the federal government. The NEA is updating its grant-making policy to focus on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the president, favoring historically Black colleges and universities and projects celebrating American independence. Democrats and arts unions criticized the cuts as disastrous to public access to creative expression.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This phrase, often used during arguments, conveys the message that the partner is inadequate and someone else would be a better fit. Over time, it can lead to insecurity and questioning of one's worth. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of openly expressing needs, and research suggests that partners who feel uncertain about the relationship are more likely to hold back and resort to comparisons.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports are negatively impacting toy exporters at the Canton Fair, with muted interest and concerns about research and development stagnation. Many exporters are hesitant to showcase new products due to plagiarism fears and reduced US participation. The tariffs are causing inventory and operational pressures, particularly for smaller toy manufacturers. While shipments to Walmart have recovered, other American retailers are holding off on new orders.</p>

          <p>Recent media reports suggest American workers are increasingly dissatisfied, engaging in behaviors like 'quiet quitting' and 'rage applying.' However, these claims are often based on surveys with small sample sizes conducted by HR firms with vested interests. The article argues that many people are content with their jobs and understand the pressures employers face, while dissatisfaction can be a motivator for improvement. The author suggests that instead of focusing on negative trends, individuals should seek to improve their work situation or find a new job if necessary.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal, a crucial passage for US East Coast-bound freight, faces potential business challenges due to President Trump's trade war with China. Tariffs on Chinese goods have led to a significant decrease in US imports from China, causing a rise in cancelled freight vessels. This decline in containers and vessels may impact the Panama Canal's revenue, which relies on the number of transits and containers moving through the waterway. The canal, already battling extreme weather, is now caught in the crosshairs of global trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a year-long investigation, the Los Angeles Innocence Project has made a court filing containing new evidence that it believes "eviscerates" the prosecutionâ€™s theory of what occurred, and proves Scott Petersonâ€™s innocence, the LAIP says. The burden on Peterson is high, but the LAIP appears to have conducted a substantial investigation and generated what they believe are compelling reasons to take another look. The question for the court will be: do all of these potential errors amount to enough in order to decide that had the jury heard about this new evidence they would have drawn a different conclusion?</p>
