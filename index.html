          <p>Over 85 international climate experts have published a detailed rebuttal to a report from the U.S. Department of Energy, labeling it as biased and "full of errors." The scientists argue the DOE report, which downplays the economic damage of carbon emissions, misrepresents scientific literature and cherry-picks data to support the fossil fuel industry. This response is part of a broader effort by the scientific community to counter what they perceive as misinformation from the Trump administration, which has been accused of politicizing scientific processes across various agencies.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has experienced a severe disruption to its vehicle production at its main UK plants due to a significant cyber attack. The company, owned by India's Tata Motors, proactively shut down its IT systems to mitigate damage, which has also impacted its retail operations. While JLR has stated there is no evidence of customer data theft, the incident has forced a halt in manufacturing and sent workers home. The National Crime Agency is now investigating the attack, which follows similar disruptive hacks on other major UK businesses.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man in Houston, Texas, has been charged with murder for allegedly shooting and killing an 11-year-old boy. The child, Julian Guzman, was playing a "ding dong ditch" prank with friends when the homeowner reportedly waited for them and opened fire as they ran away, striking the boy in the back. Authorities stated that the circumstances of the shooting do not appear to support a self-defense claim, despite Texas's laws on the use of deadly force. The incident highlights a tragic and disproportionate response to a childhood prank.</p>

          <p>As the price of gold approaches record highs, new investors may find it challenging to enter the market. This article suggests several strategies for beginners to gain exposure to the precious metal without paying top market prices for a full ounce. Methods include investing through gold ETFs or stocks, which offer lower entry points, and considering fractional gold options like smaller bars or coins. Additionally, employing a dollar-cost averaging approach can help build a position over time by investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, mitigating the impact of price fluctuations.

          <p>Argentine authorities are investigating the family of a deceased Nazi official after a 17th-century painting, believed to have been looted from a Jewish art dealer during WWII, was spotted in a property advertisement. The artwork, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was part of Jacques Goudstikker's collection, which was plundered after he fled the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands. After the painting was recognized in the ad, it disappeared from the home, leading police to place the Nazi's daughter and son-in-law under house arrest as the search, involving Interpol, continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Carolina is challenging a federal appeals court ruling that grants a transgender high school student access to the boys' bathroom, taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. State Attorney General Alan Wilson argues the ruling conflicts with a state law requiring facilities to be based on biological sex and creates an untenable situation for the school district. The state's emergency filing cites the Supreme Court's recent decision upholding a ban on gender-affirming care for minors as a guiding precedent. Attorneys for the student argue there is no emergency that justifies the Supreme Court's intervention in the ongoing lower court appeal.</p>

          <p>Following a Labor Day weekend heatwave, Southern California is now experiencing a surge of monsoonal moisture, bringing thunderstorms and lightning that significantly increase the risk of wildfires. Meteorologists tracked hundreds of lightning strikes, raising concerns about new fire starts, similar to the devastating lightning-sparked fires of 2020. A flood watch has also been issued for parts of Central and Southern California due to the potential for heavy rain and flash flooding, especially in recent burn scar areas. This combination of extreme weather highlights the state's ongoing vulnerability to climate-related events.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of prominent economists, including several Nobel laureates, have co-signed an open letter denouncing President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her position. The letter warns that such actions threaten the central bank's crucial political independence, a cornerstone of the U.S. financial system's credibility. The move came after the Trump administration accused Cook of "mortgage fraud" and initiated a criminal investigation, which the economists describe as resting on "unproven accusations." They argue the effort is part of a broader pattern of political pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the Trump administration's tariffs are illegal, a decision that could potentially require the government to refund billions of dollars in collected duties.

Shippers are currently in a holding pattern, awaiting the final legal outcome before making major changes to their operations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its key interest rate in September, homeowners and buyers should temper their expectations for a significant drop in mortgage rates. The anticipated cut is only a modest 25 basis points, which is likely to have a minimal immediate effect on the mortgage market. Furthermore, many lenders may have already "priced in" the expected cut, meaning current mortgage offers already reflect the anticipated change. Mortgage rates are also influenced by other factors, such as the 10-year Treasury yield, so a single Fed action is unlikely to cause a dramatic decline.</p>

          <p>Walmart is bolstering its Walmart+ subscription service to better compete with Amazon Prime by adding NBCUniversal's Peacock as a streaming option. Starting September 15, members will be able to choose between receiving an ad-supported version of Peacock Premium or Paramount+, with the ability to switch between the two services every 90 days. The move adds significant value to the $98 annual membership without increasing the price. This strategy allows Walmart to enhance its entertainment offerings and appeal to consumers without investing in its own original content, a key differentiator from Amazon's approach.</p>

          <p>Members of the Proud Boys, who were imprisoned for their roles in the January 6 Capitol riot before being pardoned by President Trump, are calling for Attorney General Pam Bondi's resignation. The demand comes after the Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss their $100 million civil lawsuit against the government, which alleges systemic abuse of the legal system and seeks reimbursement for their legal fees and imprisonment. The DOJ's motion argues for dismissal based on sovereign immunity and the plaintiffs' failure to exhaust other administrative remedies. The conflict creates an unusual situation where pardoned allies of the president are in a public dispute with his own Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, whose firm Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in Kraft Heinz, has stated he is disappointed with the company's plan to split into two separate entities. The move effectively undoes the major 2015 merger that Buffett and 3G Capital orchestrated. Shares of Kraft Heinz fell more than 7% following his comments. Buffett conveyed that while the original merger did not perform as expected, he does not believe that breaking up the company will solve its underlying problems. Despite the stock's long-term struggles, Buffett has stood by the investment, though he previously admitted Berkshire had overpaid for Kraft.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines for domestic law enforcement in Los Angeles. The 1878 law prohibits the use of the military for such purposes. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, blocks the administration from using military forces for crowd control, arrests, or searches within California. The lawsuit was brought by Governor Gavin Newsom in response to the deployment during protests against immigration enforcement operations, with the judge warning against the creation of "a national police force with the President as its chief."</p>

          <p>The military-governed nation of Burkina Faso has passed a new law that prohibits "homosexual practices," with penalties including prison sentences of up to five years and financial fines. The legislation, which was passed unanimously by the unelected parliament, was described by the justice minister as a move to uphold "marriage and family values." Human rights organizations like Amnesty International have condemned the law as an "alarming setback" that violates equality and creates discrimination. The move makes Burkina Faso the latest in a number of African nations to enact or toughen anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.</p>

A key component of this strategy is SRS's trade credit program, which allows contractors to buy materials and pay for them later, a feature described as a "hidden gem" of the deal. This financing option helps Home Depot attract and retain "complex pro" customers working on larger projects. The company has already seen a double-digit increase in spending from pros who use the trade credit accounts and plans to integrate the service into its physical stores.</p>

          <p>The deepening partnership between China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin, framed as a counterweight to the West, has paradoxically helped maintain the cohesion of U.S.-led alliances. Despite the Trump administration's disruptive approach to foreign policy, China has not capitalized on the opportunity to improve ties with European or Asian allies. Instead, Beijing has continued policies, such as supporting Russia's war in Ukraine and making aggressive claims in the South China Sea, that alienate those same nations. By treating the democratic world as a unified adversary, Xi and Putin reinforce the very alliances they seek to undermine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to pay a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to investors with taxable income below certain thresholds, which are now more attainable for some due to a higher standard deduction and other breaks. This allows for "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets can be sold tax-free during lower-income years. Investors can also use this to sell and immediately rebuy assets to reset their cost basis, potentially reducing future tax liabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To combat financial pressures that have led to closures and acquisitions, independent rural hospitals across the U.S. are forming "clinically integrated networks." These collaborations allow hospitals to remain autonomous while pooling resources to negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units and share specialists. By combining their patient populations, these networks can also better engage in value-based care contracts with insurers, which reward quality of care over quantity. This model provides a crucial alternative for survival, helping to preserve essential healthcare services and jobs in underserved rural communities.</p>
