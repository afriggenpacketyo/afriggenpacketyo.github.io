          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israeli forces recovered the bodies of Judy Weinstein-Hagi, 70, and Gadi Hagi, 72, from the Khan Younis area in southern Gaza. The couple, dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, were killed during Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack and their bodies were abducted. The IDF had previously determined they were killed on the day of Hamas' surprise attack by the same terror group that abducted and killed Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas and her two young children. Netanyahu vowed to continue efforts to bring all abductees home, both living and dead. Currently, 56 hostages remain in Gaza, with 20 believed to be alive, including two Americans.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka, two dominant figures in women's tennis, are set to face off in the French Open semi-final. This highly anticipated match marks their first encounter at the clay-court Grand Slam and their first competitive meeting since the Cincinnati Open last August. Swiatek, seeded fifth, is aiming for her fourth consecutive title, while Sabalenka seeks her first crown. Swiatek holds a head-to-head advantage with eight wins from 12 matches, including five of six on clay, but questions linger over her current form.

          <p>The British government announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 pupils in England from September 2026. Any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible, regardless of their income, saving parents £500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated £1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, with an additional £13 million pledged to food charities. While the change has been largely welcomed, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective in reducing child poverty. The total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population.</p>

          <p>Burundi held elections for a new parliament, with the ruling CNDD-FDD party expected to maintain its grip on power due to the effective sidelining of the main opposition party, the CNL. The CNL was suspended in 2023, and its leader was ousted in a move widely seen as government orchestrated. With the opposition weakened, the ruling party faces limited electoral threat, despite mounting internal pressure over economic mismanagement and political repression. Burundi is grappling with widespread shortages, soaring inflation, and rising public anger, compounding its existing status as one of the world's poorest countries.</p>

          <p>A Ryanair flight traveling from Berlin to Milan made an emergency landing at Memmingen Airport in Bavaria after encountering violent turbulence, injuring nine people. Eight passengers and one crew member were hurt, with three people hospitalized for treatment. The German police reported that severe storms in southern Germany caused the turbulence. Authorities deemed the plane unfit to continue flying, and the airline arranged bus transport for the passengers to Milan. Elsewhere in the region, storms damaged several homes in Ulm, Baden-Württemberg, with officials suspecting a small tornado or waterspout caused the damage.</p>

          <p>Boeing has agreed to pay $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, a deal criticized as "morally repugnant" by a lawyer representing victims' families. The agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice includes payments to the families and investments in compliance and safety programs. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for some of the victims' families, stated that the deal allows Boeing to sidestep true criminal accountability. The crashes, linked to faulty flight control systems, prompted the grounding of the 737 Max for nearly two years, and many relatives have sought a public trial and harsher penalties for Boeing.</p>

Trump has long questioned Biden's mental acuity, claiming his administration was influenced by radical policy shifts.

Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese, the MHRA says.

          <p>Differing attitudes to women’s and transgender rights activism are often attributed to generational differences, with younger people more likely to support transgender rights. The author argues that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy or fairness is sexist, disadvantaging women. She suggests that consciousness of sexual difference accumulates across the life-course, influenced by experiences like childbirth, menopause, and aging. The author supports transgender people’s right to be protected from discrimination, but she believes the law must recognize the different needs and experiences of women and men.</p>
