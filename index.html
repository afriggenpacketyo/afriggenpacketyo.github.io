          <p>A tribute from former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky celebrates the life and career of correspondent Mark Knoller, who passed away. Knoller was renowned for his 32-year tenure at CBS, where he became the unofficial statistician of the White House, meticulously tracking presidential activities across eight administrations. Revered by colleagues and presidents from both parties, he was remembered for his encyclopedic knowledge, distinctive radio voice, and selfless, generous character. His work provided an invaluable historical record of the American presidency.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Confirm 'Selective Hearing' as a Genuine Neurological Process</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 11:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientific research confirms that "selective hearing" is not a conscious choice but a real neurological function known as auditory selective attention. This cognitive process allows the brain to filter out background noise and focus on specific sounds, such as a single voice in a crowded room. Audiologists explain that the brain's auditory and prefrontal cortices work together to prioritize important auditory information, which can become more difficult with age-related hearing loss. While occasional zoning out is normal, persistent difficulty could indicate underlying hearing issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a plan to remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea, aiming to maximize fossil fuel extraction. This policy shift, contrasting with the Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses, is framed as a move to bolster the economy. Critics, including environmental groups and other political parties, have condemned the plan as "reckless environmental vandalism," warning it will not lower energy bills and will accelerate the climate crisis, undermining the UK's 2050 net zero commitments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Labor Day weekend, numerous beaches across the United States have been issued swimming advisories due to high levels of fecal bacteria in the water. Popular coastal destinations from Florida to Maine and California are affected, with health officials warning that the contamination can cause illnesses like nausea and rashes. A recent report from Environment America found that a majority of U.S. beaches tested experienced at least one day of potentially unsafe contamination levels. The pollution is primarily attributed to overflowing sewer systems and polluted runoff.</p>

          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as the CDC's immunizations chief, has voiced strong criticism of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, stating, "I only see harm coming." Daskalakis fears that the new administration is dismantling the barrier between science and political ideology, particularly concerning vaccination policies. He and other former health officials worry these changes, such as new limits on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, will undermine public health, erode trust in science, and leave the nation vulnerable to future health crises.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is publicly clashing with President Donald Trump regarding crime in Baltimore, stating he has no interest in fighting the president but will fight for his communities. The feud escalated after Trump called Baltimore a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore dismissed as "performative." While acknowledging the city's challenges, Moore highlighted recent reductions in crime and criticized the president for offering "arrogant criticism" instead of constructive federal support. The dispute also involves personal attacks on Moore's military record.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military forces into Chicago, labeling the potential move an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been contacted about the deployment and argued that President Trump's motives extend beyond crime reduction, possibly aiming to influence future elections. He asserted that such an action would be an unconstitutional attack on the American people and state sovereignty. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker's handling of Chicago's crime rate.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, comedian Jim Gaffigan shares his annual struggle with an overabundant summer garden, specifically an uncontrollable surplus of cucumbers. He recounts his initial gardening ambitions in May, followed by a misguided attempt at "succession planting" that resulted in a relentless wave of produce. After exhausting options like salads and pickles, he finds himself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of cucumbers. Gaffigan humorously concludes that despite his best intentions each year, he consistently proves he is not a farmer, but rather a man desperate to give away vegetables.</p>

In his new book, he explores how the brain can "memorize" pain signals, leading to persistent suffering even without a clear physical cause. The article features a patient with a rare pain syndrome who found relief through a groundbreaking clinical trial using deep brain stimulation to interrupt these pain signals before they reach consciousness. This innovative approach suggests a future where pain can be managed by targeting its neural origins.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. This prize ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history. The last jackpot win occurred on May 31, allowing the prize to accumulate over several months. The winner of the next drawing can choose between receiving the full amount in payments over 30 years or a lump sum of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. The odds of winning the grand prize are about 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is entering a new and dangerous multipolar arms race, significantly increasing the threat posed by advanced ballistic missile capabilities. The author contends that, much like during the Cold War, adversaries can now hold entire populations hostage under the threat of nuclear conflict, with war potentially being just one button press away. The piece suggests that while the "long peace" following World War II may have been an exception in human history, the current trajectory towards perpetual conflict is not inevitable and can be reversed, despite the radically changed nature of modern warfare.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, including the move to fire Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-held political independence. While the administration frames its actions as reforming an unpopular institution to lower interest rates and boost the economy, critics warn of severe consequences. Experts argue that politicizing the Fed could undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system, erode the dollar's credibility, and risk the kind of hyperinflation seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

          <p>The recently released transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with the Justice Department are being criticized for what they lack, particularly the failure to press for names of powerful individuals connected to Jeffrey Epstein. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that some of Epstein's associates were serving in Donald Trump's cabinet, but the interviewer did not ask for specifics. Critics and victims' attorneys argue this demonstrates a reluctance to pursue the full truth. They point out that despite the administration's claims of transparency, the interview seemed to avoid difficult questions and key victims have not been contacted for their testimony.</p>

The article posits that Trump's supreme confidence in his own "gut instinct," combined with his disinterest in reading briefing reports, leads to dangerous and nonsensical policy choices. This pattern is supported by comments from former top aides who have described him as an "idiot" or a "moron."</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, sheds light on the origins of surfing in the mainland United States. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—were studying at a nearby military school and decided to surf the local waves. They crafted boards from local redwood, replicating the giant boards they used back home, and demonstrated the "royal sport" to amazed locals. This event, documented in a local newspaper, planted the seed for surfing culture in America 140 years ago.</p>

The measure imposes a significant surcharge on second homes valued over $1 million, which could add over $136,000 to the pop star's annual property tax bill. Driven by tight budgets and populist anger over housing costs, states like Montana are adopting similar measures. Real estate brokers argue these taxes unfairly penalize seasonal residents who contribute heavily to local economies while using few public services, potentially driving wealthy buyers to other states.

However, these same traditions also advocate for feeling "sympathetic joy" or the happiness of others. The article argues against becoming fixated on either despair or forced positivity, concluding that experiencing both joy and sorrow is part of being a connected human, and allowing oneself to feel good can be a form of resistance.</p>
