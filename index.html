            <p>In response to mounting growth concerns and the implementation of U.S. reciprocal tariffs, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, the lowest since September 2022. The move comes as India faces a 26% tariff on goods entering from the U.S. and follows a weaker-than-expected GDP growth of 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024. HSBC predicts the tariffs will directly reduce India's full-year growth by 0.5 percentage points for the financial year ending March 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

Lesotho and Cambodia face significant tariff rates of 50% and 49%, respectively, while the EU, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan also face increased duties.

            <p>U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon supports national student testing and federal education research, but provides limited details on the Trump administration's threats to cut funding if diversity programs aren't eliminated. McMahon defends aggressive actions to reduce the Education Department's bureaucracy, arguing that American public schools have continued to decline despite vast spending. She emphasizes that discrimination is the 'bad thing' and that no one's rights should be taken away to serve others. McMahon pledges support for historically Black colleges and universities, and criticizes those who claim the President wants to eliminate education.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in funding for Cornell University and $790 million for Northwestern University, citing concerns over the protection of Jewish students on campus. The funding pause affects grants and contracts with federal departments, including health, education, agriculture, and defense. Cornell officials expressed awareness of the media reports and noted receiving over 75 stop work orders from the Department of Defense. Northwestern officials said they had not received any official notification but have cooperated in the investigation. The move is part of a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus protests.</p>

With the region staring down the barrel of more devastating trade consequences as the new tariffs are due to take effect on Wednesday, a shadow has fallen over economic growth in the region. The Post has calculated the share of exports from some major Asian economies to the United States, as a percentage of national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 â€“ used as one indicator to delve into their dependency and exposure to potential risks.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is expediting the construction of 2.5 miles of new border barrier between Mexico and California by bypassing environmental regulations. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem cited the need to prevent unlawful entries into the United States. The waiver covers projects near Jacumba Hot Springs, funded through CBP's fiscal year 2020 and 2021 budgets. The advocacy group Earthjustice criticized the move. Since Trump's inauguration, over 50 miles of permanent and temporary wall sections have been constructed, with a goal of completing about 1,400 miles of uninterrupted border barrier.</p>

            <p>Palm Springs, California, has installed 'Palm Springs Loves Canada' signs in its downtown area to reassure Canadian tourists amidst concerns that Trump's policies are scaring them away. The city relies heavily on Canadian tourism, with an estimated 300,000 Canadians visiting each year. Local businesses fear that the tariffs and rhetoric about Canada will deter Canadians from their annual trips. The city hopes to send a 'positive message' and encourage Canadians to reconsider their travel plans. Two Canadian budget airlines have already reduced flights between western Canada and Palm Springs due to reduced demand.</p>
