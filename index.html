        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a doubling of steel tariffs to 50% during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill near Pittsburgh, following his support for a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel. Trump stated the increase would secure the steel industry and also apply to aluminum, taking effect on June 4. The Nippon deal aims to keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pennsylvania, with Trump touting it as an investment controlled by the U.S. The United Steelworkers union expressed reservations, while U.S. Steel warned of potential job losses without the acquisition; the deal includes protections for workers and facilities, along with a $5,000 bonus for employees (not investment advice).</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 19:30:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times explores the potential connection between the rise of therapy culture and declining birth rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that heightened awareness of potential harm, abuse, and trauma in childhood has led to stricter parenting standards. This has resulted in a reluctance to have children, fearing they won't meet these unattainable standards, which were influenced by the cultural shift towards recognizing emotional and relational struggles as significant forms of harm. The article posits that this cultural shift may contribute to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, leading to generational dread of parenthood.</p>

          <p>Following John Mellencamp's criticism of Pat McAfee's explicit speech hyping up Indiana Pacers fans, Pacers legend Reggie Miller appeared to show support for Mellencamp. McAfee's speech during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals drew Mellencamp's disapproval, leading to a response from McAfee on X. Miller then posted a video montage of him greeting Mellencamp, emphasizing Mellencamp's importance to Indiana, further fueling the apparent divide. The Pacers won Game 4 but lost Game 5, sending the series back to Indiana for Game 6.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump reportedly fired the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, citing her support for diversity initiatives and alleged partisanship. The gallery had a caption referencing the January 6th Capitol attack in its collection of presidential portraits. Legal experts question Trump's authority to fire Sajet, as the gallery is part of the Smithsonian, which isn't directly run by the executive branch. Sajet, who emphasized even-handedness, previously stated that the gallery tried to be fair in its portrayals of American presidents.</p>

The images were originally commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz for discredited research aiming to prove white superiority. The agreement signifies a resolution in a debate about universities addressing historical ties to slavery, with Lanier expressing elation at the outcome.</p>

The SEC doesn't consider most meme coins securities under U.S. federal law, removing them from the agency's purview. Peirce advised investors not to expect SEC protection and to buy at their own risk, similar to the NFT situation in 2021. The $TRUMP token, largely controlled by the Trump Organization, has seen significant value fluctuations, and some lawmakers are concerned about potential conflicts of interest (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to that granted to legislative and executive branches. They claim prosecuting Dugan threatens public trust in the judicial system and would stifle independent decision-making by judges.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former Sinn FÃ©in leader, has been awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages over a BBC story about the murder of a British agent, Denis Donaldson. A court found that Adams was defamed in a BBC NI Spotlight program and an accompanying online article, in which an anonymous contributor alleged he sanctioned Donaldson's murder. Adams denies any involvement and stated the case was about putting manners on the BBC. The Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faces legal challenges to its use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, leading to uncertainty over its trade agenda. A federal court struck down the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), but a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the levies. Experts suggest alternative pathways for imposing tariffs, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The White House maintains its commitment to addressing trade deficits and using all available tools to advance trade policies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is suing President Donald Trump to block his attempt to cut off its federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the public broadcaster over perceived political slights in news coverage.

The White House responded that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was creating media to support a particular political party.
