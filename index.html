          <p>President Trump announced that Fox News host Jeanine Pirro would serve as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after withdrawing Ed Martin's nomination. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter and former Westchester County district attorney, has been a vocal defender of the president and received a pardon for her ex-husband during Trump's previous term. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and history as a top district attorney. Martin's nomination faced strong opposition due to his support for individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot, leading to the withdrawal of his nomination.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department, under President Trump, has initiated a criminal fraud probe into New York Attorney General Letitia James, who previously won a civil fraud case against Trump. The FBI is leading the investigation, which stems from allegations that James falsified bank documents and property records to obtain favorable loan terms. James denies the allegations, calling them baseless, and her attorney, Abbe Lowell, has criticized the investigation as political retribution. The investigation began after William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleging that James "has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.</p>

          <p>President Trump intends to appoint Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., following the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination.

Her appointment resolves a challenging situation for Trump, who faced pressure from Senate Republicans regarding Martin's nomination. Pirro's background in law enforcement and unwavering support for Trump make her a suitable choice for the role, which has a term limit expiring May 20th.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has decided to withhold bonus payments from many laid-off employees, despite the bonuses being earned for high performance in the previous year.

They criticized Alabama's deliberate disregard for the court's order to create a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect their preferred candidate.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is claiming a limited victory with a new trade deal with the United States, amidst a series of complex trade agreements. While ministers are highlighting the real-world benefits of the deal, critics argue it primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a deep free trade agreement. The agreement avoids issues related to the NHS and food standards and does not dilute the UK's Digital Services Tax. The deal provides some relief for key UK industries, particularly car manufacturing and steel, but the full implications will depend on further details and future actions by the US.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have reached an agreement to reduce import taxes on British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. This offers relief for key UK industries from some of the tariffs imposed by President Trump, though a 10% duty remains on most goods from the UK. The deal will reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and slashes tariffs on steel and aluminum. The two sides have also agreed to reciprocal access for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers.</p>

          <p>Coinbase shares experienced a decline following the announcement that first-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, despite the growth in stablecoin revenue. The company's consumer trading volume decreased by 17% compared to the fourth quarter, influenced by volatility stemming from Trump's tariff policy. While the first quarter saw positive developments for cryptocurrency, concerns about Trump's tariff policy dampened investor appetite for riskier assets. For the second quarter, Coinbase anticipates subscription and service revenue in the range of $600 million to $680 million.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing a lawsuit alleging that the Eaton fire exposed residents to dangerous levels of lead, asbestos, and other toxic substances. The suit claims Edison's negligence in maintaining its infrastructure caused the fire, leading to the contamination. The lawyers cite a Times investigation that found toxic heavy metals in soil samples even after federal crews removed ash and topsoil. The company acknowledges its equipment may have ignited the fire, but the cause remains under investigation. The lawsuit seeks compensation for residents harmed by the toxic substances and funding for medical monitoring.</p>

          <p>A mistrial has been declared in the murder trial of a Michigan police officer, Christopher Schurr, who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, during a traffic stop.

The incident, captured on multiple recordings, showed Schurr shooting Lyoya after a scuffle over the officer's Taser. The case sparked widespread protests and focused on racial injustice and policing.

          <p>The increasing public attention on individual federal judges, rather than on the law itself, is a concerning trend that could undermine the rule of law. This shift towards focusing on judges as personalities risks politicizing the judiciary and delegitimizing the court system. While scrutiny of public officials is necessary, the emphasis should remain on the law, precedent, and evidence, rather than on attacking or celebrating individual judges.

This change would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts. The president believes a tax increase on the rich would help protect Medicaid, a healthcare program for the poor, as Republicans prepare to cut spending on the program to offset the cost of tax cuts.</p>
