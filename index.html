          <p>Norman Tebbit, a prominent and often controversial cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. A loyal Thatcherite, he was known for his tough stance on trade unions and his famous "on your bike" speech encouraging the unemployed to seek work. Lord Tebbit and his wife were also seriously injured in the 1984 IRA bombing of the Conservative Party conference. Political figures from across the spectrum have acknowledged his significant, albeit divisive, impact on British politics.</p>

          <p>The world's first commercial deep-sea mining operation in international waters may soon be approved, led by The Metals Company (TMC) with US backing. The venture is framed as a matter of national security to compete with China's dominance in rare earth minerals essential for green technology. However, scientists warn of irreversible damage to poorly understood deep-ocean ecosystems, questioning the necessity of these metals as battery technology evolves. Critics also point to the company CEO's past involvement in a similar failed venture that resulted in significant public losses for Papua New Guinea. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former FBI special agent has warned that Iranian sleeper cells could be hiding in the United States, potentially targeting less-protected rural areas. This concern follows a Department of Homeland Security bulletin about a heightened risk of Iranian-backed terrorism after recent US military actions. The expert, Jonathan Gilliam, suggests that current border policies may have facilitated the entry of individuals who could pose a threat. Federal sources indicate that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has recently increased arrests of Iranian nationals.</p>

          <p>An early analysis of the NBA's free agency period identifies clear winners and losers based on recent trades and signings. The Atlanta Hawks, Denver Nuggets, and Houston Rockets are praised for making strategic moves that significantly improve their rosters and championship potential. Conversely, the New Orleans Pelicans are criticized for a baffling draft-day trade that mortgaged their future, while the Milwaukee Bucks made a costly decision to handle Damian Lillard's contract. The article also notes that superstars LeBron James and Luka Dončić may be left on a Lakers team that isn't making urgent win-now moves.</p>

          <p>Research teams in China have achieved notable breakthroughs in optical chip technology, which could help meet the massive computing demands of generative AI. These chips use light instead of electrons to transfer data, offering potentially greater speed and efficiency as traditional electronic chips approach their physical limits. While the underlying theory isn't new, Chinese scientists have demonstrated a significant increase in computability by expanding the number of light channels used for data transfer. This hardware innovation is seen as a key step in advancing AI development.</p>

The campaign for this change was spearheaded by Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Harvey Weinstein, who broke her own NDA.

          <p>Public records reveal that local officials in Kerr County, Texas, the site of recent deadly floods, had discussed the need for an improved flood warning system for nearly a decade. As early as 2016, commissioners acknowledged the area's high flood risk and the inadequacy of existing infrastructure. A 2016 study, which cost $50,000, recommended a comprehensive new system costing nearly $1 million, but the project appeared to stall due to a lack of commitment from local partners. Just this year, another government authority was in discussions to develop a new system, highlighting the long-recognized vulnerability of the region.</p>

Under the charismatic management of Renato Gaúcho, the underdog team has shown surprising defensive solidity, thanks in large part to Silva's leadership.

          <p>Beijing's implementation of export controls on rare earths has triggered a wave of international efforts to diversify supply chains for these critical minerals. Recent announcements include an Australian company beginning exploration at a project in Brazil and a US-Kazakh partnership to explore a site in Kazakhstan. These moves highlight a global pushback against China's long-standing control over the minerals, which are vital for high-tech and green-energy industries. However, analysts note that despite these efforts, Beijing still holds a "strong hand" in the strategically important market.</p>

The eruption, accompanied by a thunderous roar and glowing red lava, has led to the evacuation of over 4,000 people and caused flight cancellations on the neighboring island of Bali.

Thailand's finance minister expressed "a little shock" but remained confident a better deal could be reached. The reactions highlight the diplomatic and economic pressure these countries now face ahead of the August 1 deadline to avoid the punishing levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yorkshire Water has declared the UK's first hosepipe ban of 2025, affecting over five million customers, due to dwindling reservoir levels. The region experienced its driest and warmest spring on record, with reservoirs currently at just over 50% capacity, a record low for this time of year. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars, with potential fines for non-compliance. The measure highlights growing concerns about water scarcity and the UK's resilience to the combined challenges of climate change and population growth.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels secured a dramatic 6-5 victory over the Texas Rangers after Nolan Schanuel earned a walk-off walk with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning. A key contributor for the Angels was veteran catcher Travis d’Arnaud, who hit a two-run home run against his former battery mate, Jacob deGrom, and later drove in the tying run. The game was a back-and-forth affair, with the Angels rallying in the sixth inning to take a temporary lead before the ninth-inning heroics.
