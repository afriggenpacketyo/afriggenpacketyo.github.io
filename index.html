        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kremlin has dismissed a plan backed by 26 Western nations to deploy international troops in Ukraine as security guarantors after a potential ceasefire. A Russian spokesperson stated that such a presence, particularly of American and European forces, is unacceptable and cannot ensure Ukraine's security. This stance contrasts with the "unbreakable pledge" from Western leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, who are pushing for a robust international force to prevent future aggression while Moscow insists on being one of the guarantors itself. The disagreement highlights the deep divisions that persist in negotiations to end the war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.6% increase in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The growth was largely attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament, which spurred spending at clothing, footwear, and online stores. Despite the monthly rise, the ONS noted a 0.6% decline in sales over the three months leading to July and apologized for previous data errors that required significant revisions. Economists caution that this boost may be temporary and that future consumer spending could be dampened by potential tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya is in advanced negotiations with the Export-Import Bank of China to convert its US dollar-denominated debt into Chinese yuan. This strategic move aims to alleviate pressure on Kenya's foreign reserves and significantly reduce interest payments on loans, particularly those for the Standard Gauge Railway. Treasury officials anticipate that the interest rate could be halved from over 6% to approximately 3% by switching to the yuan. The plan is seen as a mutually beneficial arrangement that could provide financial relief for Kenya while expanding the international use of China's currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The commercial space industry is experiencing significant growth, highlighted by Rocket Lab's recent introduction of Launch Complex 3 for its new Neutron rocket in Virginia. This development addresses a rising global demand for launch capacity, a market long dominated by SpaceX, which conducted over half of the world's orbital launches in 2024. The expansion of launch providers is seen as crucial for reducing overreliance on a single company and fostering a more resilient space ecosystem. As new rockets from various companies are scheduled for liftoff in the coming years, the sector is poised for increased competition and innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) highlights that wildfires, likely exacerbated by climate change, were a significant contributor to air pollution in the past year. Major fires in regions like the Amazon, Canada, and Siberia have degraded air quality on a continental scale, spreading harmful PM2.5 particles far beyond their origin. For instance, emissions from Amazon wildfires affected air quality in densely populated Brazilian cities, while smoke from Canadian fires reached Europe. The WMO warns that this problem is expected to intensify as the climate warms, posing increasing risks to human health and ecosystems globally.</p>

The approach is considered lower risk than a startup because the business already has a proven track record, customers, and revenue. With outsized returns compared to traditional investments, search funds are gaining popularity as a way to build wealth and address a looming succession crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not move manufacturing to the United States. Speaking at a White House dinner with tech industry leaders, he confirmed that the tariffs would be implemented soon but would not apply to firms like Apple that are expanding their domestic investments. The policy is part of a broader effort to onshore the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, which has already prompted major foreign chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung to commit to building plants in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Multiple papers are calling it "judgement day" for Rayner as she awaits the results of an ethics investigation into her past financial conduct. Simultaneously, Dorries' move to Reform UK is being described as a "seismic blow" to the Conservatives, with her departure expected to boost Nigel Farage's party.

The challenge came after Cuomo, running as an independent, called for Mamdani to debate him one-on-one and suggested other candidates drop out. The situation is fueled by reports that the White House is exploring ways to consolidate the field to prevent a victory by Mamdani, whom Trump referred to as a "communist." Mamdani's move aims to frame the race as a direct contest against Trump's influence, calling Cuomo the president's "puppet."</p>

The administration argues that the name change projects a more powerful image and "conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve," with the president deeming the current title too "defensive." The Department of Defense was known as the War Department until 1947, when it was reorganized after World War II.</p>
