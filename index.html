          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has voiced concerns about the U.S. economy's vulnerability to a downturn, citing the fading impacts of pandemic-era government spending and monetary policy.

He also noted that lower levels of immigration and risks in private credit are complicating factors. Dimon advised against buying credit at current prices and spreads, while acknowledging his history of cautious economic outlooks.

          <p>Scientists have identified a new tyrannosauroid species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, which lived over 85 million years ago in Mongolia, representing a 'missing link' in the evolution of apex predators like the T. rex. This mid-grade tyrannosauroid, weighing around 1,700 pounds, possessed features not seen in later, more iconic tyrannosaurs, such as teeth incapable of crushing bone. The discovery, based on a skeleton found in the Gobi Desert in the 1970s, helps rewrite the family history of tyrannosaurs, showing how these Asian species eventually crossed into North America and evolved into apex predators. This new discovery has brought excitement to the paleontology community.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk secured a parliamentary vote of confidence in his pro-European government, days after a presidential election defeat. Tusk's call for the vote aimed to reassert his authority following the election of right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki as president. The vote saw 243 members of parliament backing Tusk's coalition, achieving the necessary majority. Despite the win, Tusk faces challenges in implementing key reforms due to the new president's expected opposition. This news provides a sense of potential stability.</p>

          <p>As Malawi prepares for elections in September, young candidates are pushing for greater political inclusion but face challenges such as entrenched party structures and financial barriers. Despite youth comprising over half of Malawi's population, older leaders often dominate candidate selection. Structural exclusion and cultural resistance further hinder youth participation, with many young people relegated to symbolic roles. Efforts to promote youth empowerment require structural reform, mentorship, and fair competition within political parties. The future of Malawi's political landscape depends on the inclusion of its youth. The future is uncertain.</p>
