          <p>The D.C. National Guard has announced a significant policy shift, stating that its members patrolling the city may now be armed, contradicting an earlier Army statement that they would not carry weapons. This change is part of a broader federal law enforcement surge initiated by the Trump administration, which has been met with criticism from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser, who view it as a federal overreach. While proponents claim the operation is making the capital safer by arresting hundreds, civil liberties advocates and some residents express alarm over the militarization of city streets and the potential for confrontations.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered across Israel, with the largest demonstration in Tel Aviv, calling for an immediate hostage release deal and an end to the war in Gaza. Organizers and families of hostages expressed fears that the government's military plans risk the lives of those still held captive, framing the conflict as a "pointless war." The protests, which included a one-day national strike, were criticized by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed they would only harden Hamas's position. This widespread civil action occurs amid a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the vast majority of the population is displaced.</p>

          <p>Terence Stamp, the distinguished English actor renowned for his portrayal of General Zod in the original "Superman" films, has passed away at the age of 87. His six-decade career began with an Oscar-nominated debut in "Billy Budd" and included memorable roles in films like "The Collector" and "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." Known for his striking looks and intense performances, Stamp became an icon of 1960s London before reinventing himself as a character actor. Colleagues and institutions like BAFTA have paid tribute to his extraordinary body of work and lasting impact on cinema.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is forecast to regain strength as it moves over the ocean. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 intensity, is currently located north of the Caribbean, prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large and growing size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast later in the week. Forecasters explained its temporary weakening is due to an eyewall replacement cycle.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O'Rourke's political organization, Powered by People, from transferring funds out of the state. The order stems from a complaint by Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argued the group's fundraising for Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to block a GOP-led redistricting effort was deceptive. The judge found that the state would be "irreparably injured" without the order. This legal action represents a major escalation in the contentious political battle over congressional redistricting in Texas, a fight that has drawn national attention.</p>

Witnesses reported that the victim, a resident of La Puente, was transported to a local hospital by other partygoers but succumbed to his injuries. As of Sunday, no arrests have been made, and Covina police are actively investigating the circumstances that led to the fatal shooting while trying to piece together the sequence of events.</p>

          <p>An early goalkeeping mistake by Altay Bayindir was the deciding factor in Manchester United's 1-0 opening day defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford. Manager Ruben Amorim's decision to start Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana drew criticism after the Turkish keeper failed to handle a corner, leading to Riccardo Calafiori's winning goal. Despite an improved attacking performance from United's new forwards, the focus remained on the team's persistent goalkeeping issues. Amorim defended his player, suggesting he was fouled, but the loss immediately highlights a key area of concern for the club's season.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that ending the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both sides. In a Sunday interview, Rubio emphasized that a realistic peace agreement cannot be achieved if one side expects to get everything it wants, describing such a scenario as a surrender, which neither party is close to. His comments signal the difficult diplomatic road ahead as the U.S. prepares to discuss the framework for a potential deal, including security guarantees and territorial lines, with Ukrainian and European leaders in Washington.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil liberty and anti-racism groups is calling on London's Metropolitan Police to cancel plans to deploy live facial recognition (LFR) technology at the Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to the commissioner, the organizations argue that LFR is an inaccurate mass surveillance tool that unfairly treats attendees as suspects and has a history of racial bias. The Met Police defends its use, insisting the technology is accurate at the settings they use and is a crucial tool to identify individuals who pose a public safety risk and help keep the massive event secure.</p>

          <p>A new study of 300,000-year-old teeth discovered at a Chinese archaeological site reveals a complex picture of human evolution in Asia. The dental remains exhibit a unique mosaic of traits, combining archaic features typical of Homo erectus with more advanced characteristics found in Homo sapiens. Researchers suggest this indicates that human evolution was not a simple, linear process and points to the possibility of interbreeding between different hominin species. The findings challenge existing timelines and suggest that modern human traits may have emerged in Asia far earlier than previously understood.</p>

          <p>Spain is grappling with multiple large wildfires across the country as a relentless heatwave enters its third week, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104°F). The fires have already claimed at least three lives, destroyed over a thousand square kilometers of forest, and forced the evacuation of thousands of residents. Regions like Galicia, Castile and Leon, and Extremadura are among the worst affected. The Spanish government has deployed military emergency units to support overwhelmed firefighters, and has requested assistance from the European Union as the crisis continues.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has shifted his stance on ending the war in Ukraine, now favoring direct negotiations for a comprehensive peace agreement over an immediate ceasefire. This new position aligns with Russia's long-held preference but puts the U.S. at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has advocated for a ceasefire as a necessary first step. This diplomatic pivot creates a tense atmosphere for Monday's meeting at the White House, where Zelenskyy and European leaders will meet with Trump to discuss the future of Western support and the path to peace.</p>

          <h2>Draft Government Health Report Appears to Avoid Strict New Rules on Pesticides</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leaked draft of the Trump administration's second "Make America Healthy Again" report indicates it will not recommend stringent restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods. This represents a potential setback for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal critic of chemical additives in the food supply. Instead of bans, the document reportedly calls for more research and "targeted" pesticide applications, a position that aligns with the intense lobbying efforts from the agriculture industry. A White House official cautioned that the document is speculative and could be altered before its official public release.</p>
