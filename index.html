        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Producer Price Index, a key measure of wholesale inflation, rose by 0.9% in July, significantly higher than the 0.2% gain that economists had anticipated. This represents the largest monthly increase since June 2022, signaling that inflationary pressures may persist as a threat to the economy. The unexpected spike has created market uncertainty and slightly lowered the odds of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Analysts suggest businesses might be absorbing tariff costs for now rather than passing them directly to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An inquest jury has concluded that the death of 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz at a failing mental health hospital was an unlawful killing. She was left unsupervised for approximately 15 minutes by a staff member on his first shift, who had used fake credentials, allowing her to self-harm in her room. The jury cited contributing factors such as insufficient staff training and unsuitable care conditions at the now-closed Huntercombe Hospital. Her parents stated the system meant to keep their daughter safe ultimately harmed her instead, leaving a permanent void in their family.</p>

          <p>Recent border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have amplified the Thai military's influence in national politics, raising concerns about a potential shift away from civilian governance. The conflict has allowed the military to operate with minimal oversight, a situation exacerbated when a leaked phone call appeared to show Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra criticizing her own army. Public trust in the military has surged amid rising nationalism, while the civilian government faces accusations of treason, creating a fragile political environment where another military coup, while not imminent, remains a possibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent move to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force was justified by claims of rampant crime, but federal data indicates a different reality. While the city saw a crime spike in 2023, violent crime has since dropped to a three-decade low in 2024. Despite this, polls show a majority of residents perceive crime as a serious, rising problem, highlighting a significant gap between public perception and statistical trends. Analysts suggest this divide is influenced by political rhetoric and the personal impact of crime, which can overshadow broader data showing improvements in public safety.</p>

The potential strike, set to begin Saturday, could disrupt travel for 130,000 customers daily during the peak summer season. The Canadian government has urged both parties to resume bargaining, while the airline warns the shutdown poses a major risk to its operations and employees.</p>

          <p>Major fast-food chains McDonald's and Wendy's have reported a slowdown in breakfast sales, attributing the trend to economic pressures on low-income consumers. Executives suggest that as financial anxiety rises due to factors like inflation and tariffs, skipping a morning meal purchased out-of-home is one of the first ways people cut discretionary spending. This decline marks a shift from a nearly decade-long breakfast boom in the industry. Economists view this trend as an indicator of broader financial stress, as consumers become more cautious with their spending amid a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

While analysts are skeptical of the offer, it underscores the potential for a forced breakup of Google's parent company, Alphabet.

          <p>Following President Trump's federal takeover of police in Washington, D.C., the mayors of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, and Oakland have responded to his suggestions that their cities could be next. The mayors, all of whom are Black and Democrats, have rejected the idea, pointing to data showing that crime rates are decreasing in their communities. They have characterized the president's rhetoric as a politically motivated attack and an overreach of authority, noting that Trump lacks the same legal power over their cities as he does over the District of Columbia.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has warned of "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operations, citing a net loss of $26 million and significant debt obligations. This financial struggle comes even as the company experiences a surge in demand for its camera film, driven by a retro trend popular among members of Generation Z. Despite increased sales and investments in its production facilities, the 133-year-old company, which previously filed for bankruptcy in 2012, is once again facing challenges in navigating its legacy business in the modern economic landscape.</p>

          <p>A recent collision between a Chinese coastguard ship and a People's Liberation Army Navy destroyer near Scarborough Shoal could prompt Beijing to review its maritime operational procedures. Footage released by the Philippines shows the coastguard vessel sustaining significant damage after the larger naval destroyer cut across its path during a confrontation with a Philippine ship. The incident, occurring in a highly contested area of the South China Sea, highlights potential coordination issues between China's different maritime forces. Analysts suggest that a review is likely to prevent similar accidents during future encounters.</p>

When asked about the potential distraction, Ohtani stated that his focus remains on the field and helping his team win. This is the second off-field legal issue to involve the two-way star in the last two years, following his former interpreter's illegal gambling scandal.</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the country's election authority of enabling large-scale "vote theft" that favored Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP party in the 2024 elections. Gandhi claims that an analysis of electoral rolls in a key constituency revealed over 100,000 fraudulent entries, including duplicate voters and bogus addresses. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has refuted the allegations, demanding Gandhi provide evidence under oath.

          <p>The move by France, the UK, Canada, and Australia to recognize a Palestinian state is being interpreted as a gesture aimed more at appeasing domestic political pressures than at achieving a breakthrough in the Middle East. These governments face growing anti-Israel sentiment within their progressive coalitions, and recognition offers a way to appear proactive. However, critics argue the policy is detached from reality, as conditions like Hamas's disarmament are unachievable. The initiative has not quieted domestic protests and may have destabilized the region by causing cease-fire talks to collapse.</p>

          <p>In a break from tradition, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will be the first to allow corporate naming rights for its venues. The agreement between the LA28 organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) abandons the long-standing "clean venue" policy that prohibited commercial names. This change will generate additional revenue to help cover the privately funded event's $7.1 billion budget and will simplify logistics by allowing well-known venues to retain their existing names. While venue exteriors can feature sponsor branding, the actual fields of play will remain commercial-free.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill" could create new complexities for individuals considering a Roth IRA conversion, according to financial experts. The legislation makes lower income tax rates permanent but introduces several new, temporary tax breaks with varying income limits. While these breaks might create more room for conversions within lower tax brackets, incurring too much income from a conversion could reduce or eliminate eligibility for deductions aimed at older Americans, tipped workers, and others. Financial planners advise a careful multi-year analysis to navigate the trade-offs and avoid unexpected tax consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are pressing the Trump administration for information on severe staffing and budget cuts at the U.S. Forest Service, raising concerns that these reductions have compromised the nation's ability to respond to a dangerous wildfire season. Despite official assurances of preparedness, internal data from July showed over a quarter of federal firefighting roles were unfilled, with some regions facing vacancy rates near 40%. Lawmakers are requesting a detailed accounting of the staffing changes, arguing that cuts to both firefighters and support personnel are forcing crews to cover administrative tasks instead of fighting fires.</p>
