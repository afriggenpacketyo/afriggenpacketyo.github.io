          <p>A massive Russian drone and missile attack targeted Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulting in at least 15 deaths, including four children, and 48 injuries. This significant assault, the first in weeks, comes as U.S.-led peace efforts falter, prompting President Zelenskyy to demand stronger international sanctions against Russia. Dozens of civilian buildings, including the European Union Delegation to Ukraine, were hit, drawing condemnation from European and British leaders who emphasized Russia's apparent disinterest in peace. The attack also follows President Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war, with the U.S. now considering changes to its policy on Ukraine's use of American-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drones continue to target Russian oil infrastructure, causing disruptions and price spikes, highlighting the escalating economic dimension of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A former Metropolitan Police volunteer officer, James Bubb, now identifying as Gwyn Samuels, has been convicted of multiple child sexual assault offenses. Bubb groomed one victim online before sexually assaulting her at age 12, and also assaulted an adult woman met online while posing as a 16-year-old girl. The court heard details of violence, including choking and punching, inflicted on the child victim. These offenses, spanning from 2018 to 2024, underscore a severe breach of trust by someone affiliated with law enforcement. The case, which included the defendant being referred to by biological sex during the trial, has been described as "challenging" by the presiding judge, highlighting the profound impact on those involved and the broader community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumers, including higher-income households, are increasingly struggling with credit card debt, which hit $1.21 trillion in the second quarter, nearing last year's all-time high. A National Foundation for Credit Counseling survey indicates a rise in "negative debt behaviors" across all income levels, from making less than minimum payments to consolidating debt. Experts cite inflation, sustained high interest rates, and a worsening employment environment as key drivers, pushing many to a "tipping point" where interest expenses exceed affordability. This widespread financial strain is also leading lenders to tighten credit standards, impacting consumer demand for significant purchases like mortgages and auto loans, with a notable increase in auto payments exceeding $1,000 monthly.

The employees were part of a protest organized by "No Azure for Apartheid," demanding Microsoft sever ties with Israel following reports of the Israeli military using its Azure cloud platform for surveillance in Gaza and the West Bank. Microsoft confirmed the firings were due to "serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct," and Smith announced a formal investigation into Israel's reported use of Azure, committing to uphold human rights principles.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) concluded the officer has a case to answer regarding the accuracy of his statements, potential inconsistencies, and his driving, which may have been outside his training. While no contact between the police vehicle and the e-bike was found, the fatal incident ignited widespread riots, injuring 31 police officers and damaging property. The boys' families are challenging the Crown Prosecution Service's decision not to prosecute, underscoring continued community concerns and the need for accountability.</p>

          <p>Iran is solidifying its "Eastward orientation" by actively participating in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, a strategic move to counter the U.S.-dominated global order and strengthen alliances with Russia and China. This geopolitical pivot gained momentum following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and recent U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, diminishing hopes for reconciliation with the West. By joining the SCO and BRICS, Tehran aims to prevent a regional anti-Iranian axis and enhance military cooperation, particularly in procuring Chinese air defense equipment. Despite internal dissent regarding Russia's support, Iran views these alliances as crucial for its security and economic insulation against Western pressure.</p>

          <p>Syria's interim government has excluded the Druze-majority province of Sweida and Kurdish-dominated regions of Hassakeh and Raqqa from the upcoming parliamentary election, citing security concerns and lack of central control. These areas, home to over 5 million people, will have their allocated seats remain vacant until conditions allow elections. The Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration and Druze leaders have vehemently criticized this exclusion as undemocratic, with some calling for a separate Druze governorate. This decision, following the ouster of Bashar Assad and the self-appointment of Ahmad al-Sharaa as interim leader, casts a shadow over the election's legitimacy and threatens Syria's unity, despite al-Sharaa's vows for an inclusive government.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump and the Fed's Board of Governors, challenging Trump's attempt to remove her from office. Cook's attorney argues the firing is "unlawful and void," asserting that the Federal Reserve Act explicitly requires "cause" for a Governor's removal, which an unsubstantiated allegation about her private mortgage applications does not meet. Trump, however, claims "sufficient reason" based on accusations of lying in financial documents, intensifying his pressure on the Fed over interest rates. This unprecedented legal battle is poised to bring up constitutional challenges, potentially reaching the US Supreme Court, and raises significant questions about the autonomy of the U.S. central bank.</p>

The first-quarter decline was largely attributed to a surge in imports, a trend that reversed in Q2, significantly contributing to the growth. However, experts note that the overall strength for the first half of the year averages only 1.4%, with underlying private-sector demand remaining weak apart from an ongoing surge in AI-related investments.

          <p>Russian and Chinese submarines have carried out their first-ever joint patrol in the Pacific, signifying a notable advancement in military cooperation between the two countries. The Russian Pacific Fleet's diesel-electric submarine Volkhov, alongside a Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy submarine, navigated an approved route through the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. This joint operation represents the latest in a series of expanded military collaborations, following a recent 15-day annual joint naval patrol. The increased coordination underscores a deepening strategic alliance and a more assertive naval presence by both nations in the highly contested and strategically important Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Australia has taken unprecedented diplomatic action by expelling Iran's ambassador and three other officials, while also designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese cited "credible intelligence" linking Iran to several antisemitic attacks against Australian Jews, including arson incidents on a kosher restaurant and a synagogue. This decisive move, the first ambassador expulsion since World War II, highlights Australia's firm stance against state-sponsored terrorism and Iran's consistent use of decentralized criminal networks for such operations. The incident underscores Iran's persistent efforts to destabilize Western nations and intimidate its diaspora, despite internal divisions within the Iranian regime regarding its foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome has been airlifted to a hospital in southern France following a serious training crash, sustaining multiple injuries including five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a lumbar vertebrae fracture. The 40-year-old British cyclist is reported to be in stable condition and conscious, with no head injuries, but is expected to undergo back surgery and will likely miss the remainder of the season. This incident marks another significant setback for Froome, who previously suffered severe injuries in a 2019 crash that ruled him out of the Tour de France. With his contract expiring at year-end and previous suggestions of 2025 being his final competitive year, this raises questions about his cycling future.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests the Trump administration should extend its successes in the war on drugs by prioritizing diplomatic cooperation with Mexico over unilateral military force against drug cartels. Despite initial tensions, Presidents Trump and Sheinbaum have resumed collaboration on extraditions, border deployments, and military training, which are seen as less diplomatically costly. The article argues that unilateral military action risks undermining the bilateral relationship for little strategic gain, as historical supply-side interventions have been largely ineffective, particularly against synthetic drugs like fentanyl. Instead, it advocates for focusing on demand-side solutions and harm reduction efforts, noting encouraging declines in U.S. overdose deaths and successful state-level programs as a more promising path forward.</p>

          <p>Australian police are conducting an extensive manhunt for 56-year-old Dezi Freeman, a radicalized conspiracy theorist believed to be heavily armed, who allegedly killed two officers and wounded a third near Porepunkah, Victoria.

Deadly shootings and police fatalities are rare in Australia, which implemented strict gun control laws after a 1996 mass shooting. Authorities are cautioning the public to avoid the alpine area and have warned that anyone harboring the suspect will face prosecution, emphasizing the seriousness of the ongoing search.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director, is challenging her reported firing by the White House, with her lawyers asserting that only President Donald Trump has the authority to remove a presidential appointee. Monarez, who served for only a month, accuses Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "weaponizing public health" and states she refused to "rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives." Her termination, attributed to not aligning with the president's agenda, has prompted resignations from other senior CDC leaders concerned about vaccine misinformation and proposed budget cuts. This high-profile dispute underscores a significant clash over public health policy, scientific integrity, and institutional independence within the administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order targeting cashless bail policies, threatening to withhold federal resources from jurisdictions that have eliminated cash bail for various crimes. Trump claims these policies endanger public safety by allowing individuals to re-offend, but critics argue his assertions are fact-free and unsupported by evidence. Studies by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Brennan Center for Justice indicate that the vast majority of defendants released without bail appear for court and do not commit new crimes. The article emphasizes that cash bail disproportionately impacts racial minorities and the economically disadvantaged, while primarily benefiting the highly profitable bail bond industry, which actively campaigns against reform efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. banking industry is undergoing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks almost halved since 2005 due to large institutions acquiring smaller regional and community banks. This trend contrasts sharply with Canada's highly concentrated system, which, with only 79 banks, was recognized as the soundest in the G7 during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts attribute Canada's stability to its few, large players who collectively rely on the nation's economic strength. However, critics like former FDIC chair Sheila Bair warn that market domination can lead to reduced competition and innovation. Proposed lower capital requirements for big U.S. banks are expected to further accelerate this consolidation, raising concerns about the future landscape of American finance.

          <p>A High Court ruling that temporarily blocks asylum seekers from being housed at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, is now under appeal, with lawyers warning it could establish a damaging precedent. The injunction, initiated by Epping Forest District Council on planning grounds, mandated the removal of 138 asylum seekers. Barristers for the Home Office argue the case risks inciting further disorderly protests around other asylum accommodations and impedes the government's legal obligation to house migrants. The hotel's owners contend the ruling disregards the potential hardship for asylum seekers and the scarcity of alternative housing. This legal battle underscores the highly contentious nature of migrant accommodation policy in the UK.</p>

While the government claims to have "listened" to feedback, critics from the Professional Association of Self-Caterers and Welsh language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith argue these "small changes" are insufficient. They contend the existing 182-day threshold is harming the tourism industry and local economies, with many businesses struggling to meet the criteria. (not investment advice)</p>

The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan is now often the best alternative, though its loan discharge component is paused. Other plans like ICR and PAYE no longer offer forgiveness and are being phased out.

Written by Tony McNamara, the film unleashes brutal humor and sharp dialogue as the couple fights over their California dream mansion, reflecting on their complex, love-hate relationship. Unlike the original, which faced criticism for unlikable characters, this version delves deeper into the nuances of their dissolution, making them more relatable despite their escalating antics.
