          <p>Search operations for Natalia Nagovitsyna, a Russian climber stranded on Kyrgystan's 24,406-foot Victory Peak, have been suspended indefinitely due to severe weather conditions, leading authorities to believe she is no longer alive. Nagovitsyna, whose husband died on a different mountain four years prior, broke her leg at around 23,000 feet and has been stranded for nearly two weeks. Previous rescue attempts, including a helicopter crash and a group of climbers stopping due to illness, proved unsuccessful. Tragically, an Italian climber, Luca Sinigaglia, died on August 15 while attempting to save her, underscoring the extreme perils and near impossibility of high-altitude evacuations on such a formidable peak.</p>

          <p>China Evergrande Group, once the country's largest developer, has been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking an ignominious end for the former high-flying company and symbolizing China's protracted property bust. With over $300 billion in debt, Evergrande's 2021 default triggered a sector-wide liquidity crisis following Beijing's "three-red-line" policy, which aimed to curb aggressive borrowing. The housing downturn persists, affecting economic growth, though analysts anticipate the drag will ease in coming years. Beijing is now implementing various measures to boost home demand, and consolidation around state-backed developers appears inevitable as many private firms face similar delisting risks.

          <p>Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny is using his current 30-concert residency in San Juan and his latest album, "DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS," to highlight the archipelago's complex history of colonialism and resistance. Collaborating with historian Jorell Meléndez-Badillo, the artist integrates historical narratives into his visualizers and concert texts, exploring themes like surveillance, colonial governance, and the influence of Afro-Caribbean rhythms on reggaeton. This project aims to educate global audiences about Puerto Rico's realities beyond tourism, fostering a deeper connection to the island's identity and politicizing a generation that has known only crisis.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argues that President Trump has a historic opportunity to help Lebanon reclaim its sovereignty from Iranian manipulation and Hezbollah's control. Pompeo asserts that Lebanon cannot thrive with two militaries, advocating for the Lebanese Armed Forces as the sole legitimate force and calling for Hezbollah to be recognized as a terrorist organization. His strategy includes ending the UNIFIL mission, providing robust support to the LAF, and systematically destroying Iran's weapons pipeline to Lebanon, using leverage over Syria. This approach prioritizes decisive military solutions over diplomatic niceties to advance American interests and ensure regional stability.</p>

          <h2>The Case for Banning Phones in Schools: A Parent's Perspective on Distraction and Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parent and former teacher argues passionately for banning cellphones in schools, citing their detrimental effects on student learning, social development, and mental well-being. Despite parental desires for emergency communication, phones act as constant distractions, increase social anxiety, and suppress opportunities for intellectual growth by allowing students to avoid real-world interactions. With 31 states already implementing or planning phone limits, early results from countries like Australia show reduced distractions and improved socialization. The article highlights the challenge of enforcement and the need for parents to embrace discomfort for their children's long-term development.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Homelessness Policy Mirrors Controversial Practices Long Used by Blue States</h2>

          <p>President Trump's proposed homelessness solution, emphasizing involuntary commitments and increased criminalization, is gaining traction despite its controversial history. This approach, which forces unhoused individuals into mandatory drug or mental health treatments, has been enabled by state laws for centuries and was historically abused. While Trump seeks to expand its use nationwide, blue coastal states like California have already extensively employed civil commitments, often with limited success in reducing unsheltered homelessness. Experts argue that such measures are only effective when coupled with accessible and affordable housing, highlighting a complex issue that transcends partisan divides.</p>

China vowed to take necessary measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea.

This article argues that the focus on protecting girls highlights an unaddressed issue: the self-destructive underbelly of patriarchy that teaches boys to ignore injuries.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent independence day greetings to Ukraine, acknowledging the steady development of bilateral relations and cooperation over 33 years. Ukrainian President Zelensky posted Xi's message on social media, expressing appreciation and interest in continued dialogue for mutual respect, peace, stability, and prosperity. This diplomatic gesture comes amidst international scrutiny of China's increasing closeness with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing, while maintaining its neutrality, uses such exchanges to balance its strategic partnerships with broader international relations, reflecting a complex foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A special general election for Iowa state senate district 1 between far-right Republican Christopher Prosch and Democrat Catelin Drey is drawing national attention as a potential indicator for the 2026 midterms. Prosch, known for extreme views on abortion and conspiracy theories, represents the GOP's embrace of extremism. A victory for Drey would break the Republican supermajority, offering Democrats hope for national momentum by connecting with voters on economic issues and countering the perception of being out of touch. The race highlights the importance of state legislatures in shaping policy and political trends.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's rhetoric consistently exaggerates urban crime, portraying cities as "cesspools of blood" despite significant declines in violent crime across most major American cities. While statistics show crime rates are at decades-lows in places like Washington D.C. and Chicago, Trump effectively taps into a rising public "fear of crime," which is at a 30-year high. This fear is fueled by gruesome news coverage, social media, and a generalized sense of disorder. Democrats are urged to acknowledge and address this pervasive fear, rather than solely relying on statistics, to build credibility and offer effective solutions beyond federal deployments.</p>

          <p>A new study by UC Berkeley economists reveals that America's 400 richest individuals pay an average tax rate of just 24 percent, significantly lower than the previously reported 34 percent and even less than many middle-class professionals. This disparity is attributed to sophisticated accounting strategies, deductions, and loopholes in the corporate tax code, which allow billionaires to shelter fortunes and make profitable businesses appear to operate at a loss. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act have further reduced these rates, contributing to growing economic inequality. (not investment advice)</p>

Polls show strong Democratic support for a permanent ceasefire and unfavorable views of Israel, with Gaza being a top issue for many swing voters.

Meanwhile, California Democrats are hoping Latino voters will bolster their candidates, despite recent shifts towards Trump.

          <p>New research challenges the perception of fish as simple-minded, suggesting they can experience and actively seek out pleasure, particularly from being groomed by other fish. Scientists studied bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, observing that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been cleaned, even without parasites. Experiments with opioid mimics increased this preference, while opioid blockers diminished it, indicating that the fish's opioid system mediates this pleasurable sensation. This finding suggests a more complex emotional life in fish and could prompt a rethinking of their treatment in aquariums and aquaculture.</p>
