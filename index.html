          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases, including several terms popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha on social media. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, "delulu," short for delusional, and "tradwife," describing women embracing traditional gender roles online. Lexicographers noted that these additions reflect the significant impact of internet culture on the evolution of the English language. Other new terms include "lewk" for a distinctive fashion look and "mouse jiggler" for a device used to feign activity while working remotely.</p>

The mixed results reflect a cautious market sentiment, influenced by geopolitical events and regional economic data, such as Singapore's unexpected contraction in non-oil domestic exports.

Whisper Owen, 36, and her 8-month-old daughter, Sandra McCarty, were found inside their Chevy Trailblazer weeks after they were reported missing. The discovery was made by a volunteer dive team in San Joaquin County. Authorities had previously stated they did not suspect foul play in the disappearance, and the California Highway Patrol is now investigating the circumstances that led to the vehicle being in the water.</p>

This development, described as a "game-changer," emerged from recent talks and represents a significant potential shift in Russia's long-standing opposition to such alliances for Ukraine. While European leaders have welcomed the move as a positive step toward a peace deal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has cautiously noted that the specific details of how these guarantees would function remain unclear.</p>

The storm is forecast to pass north of the Caribbean, with warnings issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. While a direct impact on the U.S. mainland is not expected, the hurricane's large size is projected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the entire Southeast coast. Forecasters are closely monitoring its path, urging residents in potentially affected areas to remain vigilant.</p>

          <p>Australia's Federal Court has imposed a A$90 million ($58.64 million) fine on Qantas Airways for illegally terminating 1,800 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and replacing them with contractors. The judge stated the significant penalty was intended to serve as a strong deterrent against large corporations viewing such contraventions as a mere cost of doing business. The case was brought by the Transport Workers' Union, which will receive A$50 million of the penalty on behalf of the fired employees. This ruling follows a separate A$120 million settlement Qantas previously agreed to with the union for the affected workers.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed actor Dame Helen Mirren has asserted that the iconic role of James Bond should continue to be played by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, Mirren believes changing the character's gender would fundamentally alter the franchise into something else entirely. Her sentiment was echoed by former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his belief that a male actor should portray the spy. This public discussion comes as Amazon MGM Studios prepares for the 26th film in the series, with plans for a "fresh" take that still honors the character's legacy.</p>

          <p>An upcoming meeting at the White House involving Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, President Trump, and European leaders is being framed as potentially more decisive for Ukraine's future than the recent U.S.-Russia summit. Analysts suggest the European contingent aims to present a united front to ensure Ukraine's direct involvement in any peace negotiations and secure concrete security guarantees. The talks follow reports that Russia may be open to Article 5-style security protections for Ukraine, a proposal that trades some occupied land for guarantees against future aggression. The central challenge remains whether Ukraine could accept a deal that involves ceding territory.</p>

This transition is expected to continue, with generics projected to form a much smaller portion of the company's revenue in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a historically low birth rate, with the total fertility rate falling below the level needed for natural population replacement. This trend mirrors demographic challenges seen in countries like Japan, where a declining population is already causing significant economic and social strain. Experts point to multiple factors, including a sharp decline in teenage pregnancies, women delaying childbirth, and broader societal shifts in values regarding family and careers. While the Trump administration is considering proposals like financial incentives to boost fertility, some experts argue that addressing issues like childcare affordability would be more effective.</p>

          <h2>Large Croatian Nationalist Concert Highlights Deep Societal Divisions</h2>

          <p>A massive concert by ultra-nationalist singer Thompson in Croatia has exposed deep divisions within the country regarding its history and national identity. The event featured chants of "Za dom, spremni" ("for homeland, ready!"), a slogan associated with the World War Two-era fascist Ustasha regime, which has been ruled unconstitutional. While supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, human rights groups and opposition parties condemn its use as neo-fascist. The controversy reflects ongoing debates over Croatia's past and its impact on contemporary society.</p>

          <p>Nearly a quarter-century after the September 11th attacks, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its mission to identify the remains of victims. Using advanced DNA extraction and analysis technologies, scientists are still making new identifications from the thousands of remains recovered from Ground Zero. The painstaking process has provided long-awaited answers for some families, like that of John Niven, whose remains were first identified 22 years after the attack. Despite the passage of time, the effort persists, as approximately 40% of the victims have yet to be formally identified.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population declining for 15 consecutive years due to a plummeting birth rate and one of the world's highest life expectancies. This trend is creating significant challenges, including labor shortages, a shrinking economy, and a strained social security system. Factors contributing to the decline include a punishing work culture, economic stagnation, and shifting social norms away from marriage and family. The government has attempted various measures, such as launching a dating app and promoting rural living, but has so far failed to reverse the country's population decline.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old man was killed after he and another man confronted individuals attempting to steal their car in a South Los Angeles alley. The incident occurred when the men heard their car alarm and went to investigate, finding three people trying to take the vehicle. As they confronted the thieves, a fourth person opened fire, fatally wounding one man in the upper torso and injuring the other in the leg. The suspects fled the scene in a red or burgundy coupe, and no arrests have been made as of Sunday afternoon.</p>

The result also had implications for other players, as Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter both performed well enough to avoid relegation from the league for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Jing Qian, a vice-president at the Asia Society, provides an analysis of the recent trade talks between the United States and China, framing them as a continuation of principles established at a prior summit in Geneva. He notes that when negotiators met, a shared interest in de-escalation was paramount due to rattled markets and a dim global economic forecast. The discussions involved high-level officials from both nations, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s Vice-Premier He Lifeng. The article positions the ongoing dialogue as an effort to manage a complex and often tense rivalry.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members deployed in Washington as part of the Trump administration's increased policing initiative may be armed. This appears to be a shift from earlier statements that Guard members would not carry weapons or make arrests, but would serve as a visible deterrent. The federal takeover of the city's policing has drawn significant criticism from local officials and residents, who view it as a federal overreach. The White House, however, maintains that the surge in law enforcement is making the nation's capital safer, citing hundreds of recent arrests.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued an expanded restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O’Rourke and his political organization, Powered by People, from sending funds to Democratic lawmakers who left the state. The lawmakers fled to block a legislative session on congressional redistricting. The judge ruled that the group's fundraising constituted deceptive practices and that financial institutions must restrain any funds belonging to O'Rourke or his group from leaving Texas. The ruling is a victory for Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is investigating the organization for its support of the absent legislators.</p>
