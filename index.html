          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck Texas's Hill Country, causing at least 24 deaths in what officials term a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, catching communities and a children's summer camp by surprise, leaving dozens of campers missing. Hundreds of people have been evacuated, and extensive search and rescue operations are underway, supported by state and federal resources. The event's severity far exceeded weather forecasts, highlighting the region's vulnerability to extreme weather.</p>

          <p>A man was killed and a woman left in critical condition after commercial-grade fireworks ignited a massive fire at a home in the Pacoima neighborhood of Los Angeles. The blaze, which occurred on Thursday night, quickly spread to four houses and a car, prompting a large-scale response from over 130 firefighters. Officials described the scene as chaotic and resembling a "war zone" due to the continuous explosions. The incident also caused a gas leak, downed power lines, and resulted in injuries to four other people and several animals.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers from several prominent institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have potential as a cancer treatment. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug could combat tumors by strengthening dendritic cells, which are crucial components of the immune system's anti-tumor response. As tumors progress, these cells can become depleted or impaired. The study indicates that sildenafil could reverse this process and restore the cells' function, opening a potential new avenue for tumor immunotherapy strategies.</p>

          <p>A federal jury acquitted Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking but found him guilty of transporting individuals for prostitution. The verdict came after a trial featuring graphic testimony from his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and others, who detailed years of physical abuse and coercive sexual encounters. Despite the acquittal on major counts, Combs's own defense team conceded his history of domestic violence, which was corroborated by surveillance footage. The outcome has sparked debate about celebrity justice and the difficulty of prosecuting complex cases involving coercive control.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of AI tools like ChatGPT for completing assignments is creating a crisis in higher education, with many professors feeling overwhelmed and unsupported. Students are increasingly offloading their work to AI, leading to a degradation of learning and classroom discussion. While some educators are trying to adapt, many university administrators appear to be turning a blind eye, creating a situation where AI may be grading essays written by AI. This trend raises fundamental questions about the value of a college degree and the future of critical thinking in a post-literate society.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing tech layoffs, workers are increasingly anxious about artificial intelligence replacing their jobs, as major companies like Amazon and Salesforce signal a shift toward AI-driven efficiency. While some executives predict significant job displacement, particularly in white-collar roles, economists suggest the transition may be slower than anticipated. The debate continues over whether AI will primarily eliminate jobs or augment them, creating new roles and rewriting workflows. For now, companies are becoming more selective in hiring, seeking specialized skills, while workers face uncertainty about the future landscape of their professions in an AI-integrated world.</p>

          <p>Despite Israeli and U.S. airstrikes that damaged Iran's nuclear facilities, a lasting victory remains uncertain as questions linger about the long-term impact. While the attacks destroyed key infrastructure, experts believe Iran retains the knowledge and likely some materials to reconstitute its program, potentially in more fortified, hidden locations. In response, Iran has suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, further complicating monitoring efforts. The conflict has devolved into a tense standoff, with analysts viewing the recent ceasefire not as a conclusion but as an intermission before the next round of hostilities or difficult negotiations.</p>

          <p>This column critiques the resurgence of the "tradwife" movement, where conservative influencers advocate for women to prioritize marriage and homemaking over careers. The author argues this is a tired trope, similar to Phyllis Schlafly's anti-feminist crusade decades ago, that ignores the significant progress and freedoms gained through feminism. The article points out the hypocrisy of successful career women like Dana Loesch telling other women they "cannot have it all." It suggests that this movement overlooks the historical context of women's rights and the very real burnout that can come from a traditional domestic life.</p>

The mayors of Adana, Antalya, and Adiyaman were detained on allegations of extortion. This follows the high-profile jailing of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in March, a key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

          <p>China has achieved a new milestone in renewable energy by launching a large offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. Developed by state-owned Sinopec, the project is part of a larger initiative that is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This will significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The solar panels, which rise and fall with the tide, benefit from the cooling effect of the water, boosting their energy generation efficiency by up to 8 percent, marking a breakthrough for the industry.</p>

          <p>Following recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a new international agreement to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a "nuclear disaster." He emphasized that any new deal must place Iran's nuclear activities under the strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The call positions China as a key mediator and critic of the recent military actions, advocating for a diplomatic solution to the long-standing crisis.</p>

          <p>This column uses the return of champion eater Joey Chestnut to the Coney Island hotdog eating contest as a lens to examine modern culture. The author describes the event as a bizarre spectacle of self-loathing and aggression that honestly reflects a society obsessed with consumption and excess. While rooted in the American ideal of abundance, the contest has become a "klaxon of decay," symbolizing a dysfunctional relationship with food and freedom. The article suggests that Chestnut's performance, in its extreme nature, acts as a form of punkish satire, holding a mirror to a world of insatiable wants.</p>

          <p>Two recent studies offer conflicting views on whether culture shapes how people see the world, reigniting a long-standing scientific debate. One study found that people from Western, "carpentered" environments perceive an illusion with rectangles, while rural Namibians see circles. However, another study convincingly argues that the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion is not culturally dependent, as it affects non-human animals and even people blind from birth. The discrepancy suggests that while our brains are shaped by our environments, the relationship between culture and perception is complex and resists simple stereotypes, highlighting that we all experience a constructed reality.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, public swimming is officially permitted in Paris's Seine River.

          <p>Sweden, the country that originated the "flight shaming" movement, has scrapped its air travel tax in an effort to boost its struggling economy. The levy, introduced in 2018, contributed to a significant drop in air travel and a corresponding rise in train ridership. However, facing a recession, the new right-wing government has reversed the policy, arguing there are "few reasons to feel flight shame." The U-turn exposes the tension between environmental goals and economic growth, and it is being closely watched by other European nations that have implemented similar taxes or bans on short-haul flights.</p>

The research, published in the journal Science, identified a "genetic switch" involving retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, that can be reactivated to promote the complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage. The researchers believe this discovery proves the existence of a mechanism for organ regeneration that may also be present in other organs.
