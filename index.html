          <p>The U.S. has announced it will stop funding Gavi, the international vaccine alliance, due to concerns about vaccine safety raised by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Kennedy criticized Gavi for allegedly ignoring scientific data on vaccine safety, while Gavi maintains its decisions align with WHO expert recommendations.  This decision raises concerns among global health experts, who predict it could lead to scaled-back vaccination efforts in lower-resource countries and potentially increase the risk of preventable diseases globally.  The Gates Foundation, a major Gavi donor, has pledged additional funding and urged others to do the same.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man deported and then returned to the U.S. for prosecution, will remain in jail as lawyers debate his potential deportation if released.  A judge ordered his release pending trial, but he could be detained by ICE.  The Justice Department is appealing the release order, arguing it could jeopardize the case.  Abrego Garcia's deportation was previously deemed an "administrative error."</p>

          <p>At least eight people were killed in Kenya during protests marking the anniversary of deadly unrest last year.  Protesters are angry over tax hikes, economic hardship, and police violence.  Authorities have closed parliament and banned live broadcasts of the protests.  The death of a blogger in police custody earlier this month has further fueled public discontent.</p>
