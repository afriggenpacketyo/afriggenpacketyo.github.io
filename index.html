          <p>Three men, Jayqwan Hamilton, Robert DeMaio, and Jacob Barroso, were sentenced for the murders of Julio Ramirez and John Umberger, who were drugged and robbed after encounters at Manhattan gay bars. The men were convicted of murder, robbery, and conspiracy, with Hamilton and DeMaio receiving 40 years to life and Barroso receiving 20 years to life. The judge highlighted the defendants' callous disregard for their victims, noting they spent stolen money on luxury goods while the victims died. The case was initially treated as isolated overdoses until families pushed for further investigation, revealing a pattern of similar incidents. The prosecution presented evidence of the men posing with Umberger's incapacitated body and showed text messages implicating DeMaio in obtaining fentanyl.</p>

          <p>Freedom Debt Relief, founded in 2002, offers debt settlement services, negotiating with creditors to reduce debt in exchange for lump-sum payments. The process involves a free debt evaluation, dedicated account setup, negotiation, and approval/payment stages. To qualify, individuals generally need at least $7,500 in unsecured debt, demonstrable financial hardship, and regular income. While the company claims to have resolved over $20 billion in debt for over a million clients, fees typically range from 15% to 25% of the total debt enrolled. Potential drawbacks include damage to credit scores and the possibility of creditors pursuing lawsuits, so it is important to remember that debt settlement should be viewed as a serious financial intervention, not a quick fix.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill faces significant hurdles in Congress due to Republican infighting. Key sticking points include the amount of spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The bill combines an extension of tax cuts passed in 2017 with other tax measures and spending cuts, aiming to satisfy both budget hawks and Republicans seeking tax reductions. However, concerns over the national debt, cuts to Medicaid, and the SALT deduction cap have created deep divisions within the party, threatening the bill's passage. Trump met with dissenting Republicans to try to convince them to support the bill.</p>

          <p>The State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction has emerged as a significant point of contention in the Republican debate over President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill." The SALT deduction, which allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes, has divided Republicans representing high-tax districts from fiscal hardliners. Trump's initial support for limiting the deduction in 2017, followed by his reversal during the 2024 campaign, has added to the confusion. The debate centers on whether to raise the cap on SALT deductions, potentially benefiting wealthier taxpayers in states with high taxes, or to maintain the cap to reduce the national debt.</p>

          <p>South Africa’s Presidential spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, told ABC News President Cyril Ramaphosa “expected” to be confronted with a “show” from President Donald Trump on Wednesday. Magwenya said Ramaphosa remained calm and dignified throughout the meeting and that the “show” that Trump put on was “noise” that doesn’t change the fundamentals of the relationship. Magwenya pointed out that South Africa has minerals that the U.S. needs and the country wants to expand its trade with the U.S. He also called the videos that Trump played “an absolute lie.”</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has made significant progress in cleaning up its streams, largely by implementing a simple solution: providing clean drinking water for cows and keeping them out of the streams. Farmer Grant Victor fenced off his cattle from Horse Creek, leading to improved water quality and a return of wildlife. As a result of such practices, about 100 Oklahoman streams once polluted by runoff from farmland have been restored to health. Horse Creek is no longer on the state’s list of most contaminated waterways.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold bars and coins can be a prudent decision, especially for beginners, as a hedge against inflation and for portfolio diversification. Gold bars and coins are easily accessible through local jewelry stores, pawn shops, and online retailers. Fractional gold investments offer a lower entry point, allowing investors to build their holdings over time. Given the potential for gold prices to rise due to various economic factors, it's advisable to invest sooner rather than later, while maintaining a diversified portfolio with gold capped at 10% or less.
