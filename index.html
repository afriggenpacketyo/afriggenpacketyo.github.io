          <h2>Police Conclude Investigation into Kneecap's Glastonbury Performance Without Further Action</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:30:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have concluded their criminal investigation into the Irish language rap trio Kneecap's Glastonbury performance, stating there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for any offense. The inquiry was launched last month after reviewing footage for potential criminal comments made on stage, following the group's pro-Palestinian stance and prior controversies, including calls for their US visas to be revoked. Despite the police's decision, the BBC notably did not livestream their performance, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had deemed their performance 'not appropriate.' This outcome closes a chapter of significant public debate and political commentary surrounding the group's artistic expression and activism, with the police recording the initial events as a public order incident.</p>

          <p>US flight cancellations have surged by 29% this summer compared to last year, reaching 1.8% of flights, while delays increased by 2.2% to an average of 62 minutes. Despite an 18% reduction in scheduled flights, about 1,000 more flights have been canceled. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) saw the highest increase at 274%, with nearly 6% of its flights canceled. Other East Coast airports like Atlanta (ATL) and Boston (BOS) also experienced significant spikes, while some, like Miami (MIA) and San Francisco (SFO), saw improvements. This trend points to ongoing operational challenges for the aviation industry.</p>

          <h2>Short-Term CDs Offer Strategic Advantage Amidst Rising Inflation and Federal Reserve Pause</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:24:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the US inflation rate rose to 2.7% in June, moving further from the Federal Reserve's 2% target, expectations for near-term interest rate cuts have diminished, likely extending high-rate opportunities for savers. A $10,000 short-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) is highlighted as a strategic investment, offering flexibility with maturities under 12 months. This allows savers to adapt to changing economic conditions while still earning hundreds of dollars in interest, such as a 4.40% rate on a 1-year CD. The current climate provides more time for consumers to shop for the best rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal prosecution, responding to public pressure for transparency. This move follows a Wall Street Journal report about a "bawdy" letter from Trump found in Epstein's birthday album. While Trump frames it as ending a "SCAM perpetuated by Democrats," critics, including Rep. Daniel Goldman, argue grand jury transcripts are limited and other evidence like videos or witness interviews would be more revealing. The Justice Department previously stated a systematic review found no "client list" or evidence of blackmail.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" and the entire "Late Show" franchise will conclude in May 2026, citing a "purely financial decision" despite the show's consistent No. 1 rating for nine seasons. Stephen Colbert informed his audience, expressing gratitude to CBS, his team, and viewers, emphasizing that he will not be replaced and the format is ending. The network praised Colbert's contributions, acknowledging the difficult decision. The news also sparked political commentary, with Senator Adam Schiff suggesting potential political motivations behind the cancellation, especially given Colbert's criticism of Paramount's settlement with former President Trump.</p>

          <p>Millions of Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollees could experience double-digit premium increases and a sharp decline in federal subsidies next year. Insurers are proposing a median 15% rate hike for 2026, up from 7% in 2025, due to rising medical costs and uncertainty over the expiration of COVID-era enhanced subsidies. If these subsidies lapse, average out-of-pocket costs could jump over 75%, potentially leading to millions going uninsured and significant political pushback. This situation, driven by Trump administration policies, could drastically reshape the healthcare market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kids' programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" are proving crucial for streaming services aiming for profitability and subscriber retention.

While live sports and hit series attract initial subscribers, children's content provides a long-term reason for parents to maintain subscriptions. Major players like Disney and Netflix are heavily investing in this genre, with YouTube also emerging as a dominant platform for children's viewership, prompting traditional media to forge partnerships and create platform-specific content.</p>

Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water were responsible for the majority of serious incidents. The Environment Secretary called the figures "disgraceful," attributing them to years of underinvestment and weak regulation.

This legislation was delayed by Democratic efforts to attach language requiring the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents, a move that exposed divisions within the GOP over transparency regarding the financier's case.

          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps defended the decision to keep secret a data breach that exposed details of nearly 19,000 Afghans and over 100 British officials, including spies and special forces. He stated his focus was on "sorting out the mess and saving lives," justifying the "super-injunction" that prevented reporting, fearing retribution from the Taliban. The breach, discovered in August 2023, stemmed from an accidental email in February 2022. While a resettlement scheme was covertly set up for affected Afghans, concerns remain about the lack of transparency and potential harm to those still in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a "benign and common" condition where leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing pooling and swelling. White House physician Captain Sean Barbabella stated that a comprehensive examination revealed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and confirmed normal cardiac function. The diagnosis followed public observations of Trump's swollen ankles and hand bruising, the latter attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. Experts affirm the condition is common in his age group and manageable, with the official memo concluding President Trump "remains in excellent health."</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reached an agreement with Brentford to sign Cameroon international Bryan Mbeumo for an initial £65 million, with potential add-ons raising the total to £70 million. The 25-year-old winger is expected to undergo a medical before joining United's pre-season tour to the United States, becoming the club's third summer signing. This transfer marks Brentford's largest ever sale. Mbeumo's versatility, ability to play as a central striker or on the wing, and proven Premier League quality are seen as significant positives for United. The club seeks consistency in forward positions, and Mbeumo is expected to provide a reliable and energetic presence fitting Ruben Amorim's system.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the New York mayoral race, particularly the treatment of candidate Zohran Mamdani, exposed profound Islamophobia in American politics. Mamdani faced racist attacks, including an ad darkening his beard and false associations with antisemitism and "global jihad." Despite apologies from some critics, the attacks intensified after his primary victory, with Republican figures making overtly bigoted remarks and questioning his citizenship. The author argues that Islamophobia has deep institutional roots, reproducing biases through societal structures and power dynamics. Mamdani's visibility and success are presented as a challenge to these ingrained prejudices, as new information combats old stereotypes.</p>

His lawyers argue the government's reasoning is "illogical" and potentially retaliatory for a previous lawsuit.

While businesses face labor shortages due to declining birth rates, the far-right insists Japan should not rely on foreign workers.
