          <p>President Trump has approved a deal through executive order to maintain TikTok's U.S. operations, with Vice President JD Vance valuing the business at $14 billion. This agreement aims to satisfy national security requirements by transferring majority ownership to American investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund. Oracle is set to oversee the app's security and provide crucial cloud computing services for the new U.S. entity, ensuring American operational control and data integrity. The transaction, however, still awaits final approval from the Chinese government, and ByteDance has not yet publicly acknowledged the agreement, adding a layer of uncertainty to its full implementation and long-term implications for the popular platform.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook have urged the Supreme Court to reject President Trump's request to fire her, arguing that such a move would undermine the Federal Reserve Board's independence. Cook's legal team contends that Trump's stated reasons for her dismissal—allegations of mortgage fraud predating her appointment—are "flimsy" and politically motivated, following his criticisms of the Fed's interest rate policies. A coalition of former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries also supported denying Trump's request, emphasizing the importance of the Fed's autonomy. The article highlights a high-stakes legal battle over presidential authority and institutional independence.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has issued a stern warning to Democratic leaders, accusing them of risking a government shutdown by making "partisan spending demands" and refusing a short-term continuing resolution. Johnson's memo highlighted past statements from prominent Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Bernie Sanders, cautioning against the negative impacts of a shutdown on average Americans. Democrats, however, argue that Republicans are pushing for a shutdown by not negotiating on key issues like the Working Families Tax Cut and healthcare for undocumented immigrants. This article frames the ongoing federal funding stalemate as a political blame game, with both parties entrenched in their positions.</p>

          <p>New car sales in the U.S. are experiencing a surprising boost, with Cox Automotive raising its 2025 sales forecast, as consumers accelerate purchases due to fears of impending tariffs and higher prices. This "pull-ahead" in demand was initially triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements and more recently by the upcoming expiration of federal EV tax credits. While the current sales pace is strong, analysts anticipate a slowdown in the fourth quarter and next year as these factors subside. This article details how major automakers like GM, Toyota, and Hyundai are benefiting, while smaller brands like Tesla and Stellantis are losing market share.</p>

          <p>Shares of CarMax plummeted 20% after the used auto retailer reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations, marking its lowest stock price in over five years. CEO Bill Nash attributed the "challenging" fiscal second quarter to changing market conditions, earlier "tariff fear-buying" that pulled sales forward, and depreciation in its inventory. The company reported declines in revenue, overall vehicle sales, and net income compared to the previous year. This article notes that other car retailers' stocks also fell, as CarMax's performance is often seen as an early indicator for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

She was subsequently wounded when officers returned fire. Under the terms of the two-year diversion agreement, Lauren must refrain from owning firearms, avoid drugs and alcohol, and attend therapy, with all charges to be dismissed upon successful compliance, a decision prosecutors did not oppose.</p>

This article provides specific calculations, showing that a 10-year HELOC at 7.88% would cost approximately $482.78 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $379.49. These figures represent a noticeable decrease compared to earlier in 2025 and last fall. The article also explains that borrowers can opt for interest-only payments during the initial draw period, making it even more manageable, especially with rates expected to decline further.

          <p>Starting September 30, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will fully transition to electronic payments, marking the end of 85 years of issuing paper checks to its nearly 70 million beneficiaries. This modernization effort, initiated by a Trump executive order, aims to significantly improve efficiency, bolster security, and reduce the risks of fraud associated with paper checks, which are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Recipients are required to enroll in direct deposit or obtain a prepaid debit card, though the article notes that exceptions will be granted for individuals who genuinely have no other means of receiving payments. Advocates, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have raised concerns about the impact on "unbanked" individuals who traditionally rely on paper checks.</p>

          <p>This article, drawn from The Atlantic's archive, delves into the complex persona and enduring poetic legacy of Allen Ginsberg, affectionately terming him a "Great American Poet-Buffoon." It portrays him as a figure of "swashbuckling vulnerability, ridiculous and unstoppable," a champion of the dispossessed and a frequenter of life's edges. The piece references his influential pro-marijuana essay, "The Great Marijuana Hoax," and his groundbreaking poem "Howl," celebrated as a hymn to society's marginalized. It also draws a poignant contrast with his father, Louis Ginsberg, a minor poet whose more formal work was published in the same magazine, highlighting the mutual respect and distinct artistic paths of father and son in American letters.</p>

His strong determination to make the team after missing the previous Ryder Cup is underscored, alongside his stated respect for rivals like Rory McIlroy.

          <p>Amazon has agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) case alleging it misled customers into signing up for Prime and made cancellations difficult. The settlement includes $1.5 billion in refunds for approximately 35 million affected Prime customers, potentially yielding $51 each, and a $1 billion civil penalty—the largest in FTC rule violation history. Amazon, without admitting wrongdoing, stated it has "always followed the law" and the settlement allows it to "move forward."

This landmark inclusion is celebrated by advocacy groups as a "watershed moment," holding particular significance for lower-income countries where dementia often encounters denial and pervasive stigma. The article notes that while the World Health Organization had a global action plan on dementia, its integration into broader non-communicable disease frameworks has historically been insufficient. This declaration aims to galvanize governments worldwide to implement improved care, support systems, and risk reduction campaigns, although full, tangible implementation is anticipated to be a multi-decade endeavor.</p>
