          <p>A federal jury has found Ryan Routh guilty on all five counts for the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Florida golf course in 2024. Routh, who represented himself during the trial, argued he lacked the capacity to kill, but prosecutors detailed a methodical plan involving surveillance and a military-grade weapon. Following the verdict, Routh was subdued by marshals after he attempted to stab himself with a pen in the courtroom. He is scheduled to be sentenced in December and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.</p>

          <p>Consumers are rushing to dealerships to capitalize on federal tax credits for electric vehicles before they expire at the end of September. The credits, $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones, were established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act but are being phased out by new legislation. This deadline has fueled a surge in EV sales, with dealers offering additional incentives to clear inventory. While September is expected to be a record sales month, industry experts are concerned about a potential sharp decline in demand once the credits are gone.</p>

Sources suggest her team is preparing for a higher office bid, and she has hired former senior advisers from Bernie Sanders' campaigns. A DNC Vice Chair commented on the party's need for a wide range of voices, from Ocasio-Cortez to more moderate figures, to effectively challenge the current administration and define the party's future direction.</p>

          <p>In a significant change of stance, President Trump stated he believes Ukraine is now in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. This declaration, made after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine should consider ceding land for peace. Trump asserted that the ongoing war is causing Russia significant economic trouble, making it appear like a "paper tiger" and creating an opportune moment for Ukraine to act. The statement came amid other administrative news, including a new probe into the White House border czar.</p>

          <p>Disney is raising the monthly subscription prices for its various streaming packages, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN, starting in late October. The ad-supported Disney+ plan will increase by $2, while the premium ad-free plan will jump by $3, with similar hikes applied to bundled offerings. This move comes as the company faces scrutiny over its handling of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," which was temporarily pulled from the air following controversial comments by the host. The price adjustment follows a similar increase from the previous year, reflecting a broader trend among streaming providers.</p>

          <p>A recent monsoon in Southern California triggered severe mudslides and flash floods, resulting in destroyed homes, a closed highway, and the death of a two-year-old child. The storm was particularly destructive in areas with burn scars, unleashing debris flows that damaged over a dozen properties in San Bernardino County. In a separate incident caused by the same weather system, a vehicle was washed away in Barstow, leading to the child's death. Authorities are continuing to assess the damage as forecasts predict more potential storms in the coming days.</p>

          <p>A top Department of Justice official, Aakash Singh, who is currently directing aggressive prosecutions of minor crimes, pleaded guilty to a DUI charge four years ago. Singh, now an associate deputy attorney general, was arrested and charged while serving as an assistant U.S. attorney in 2021. Legal experts note that his subsequent promotion to such a high-ranking position is unusual given the DOJ's typically strict stance on criminal backgrounds. The revelation adds another layer of scrutiny to his current role, where he has reportedly encouraged prosecutors to pursue harsh charges against protesters.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's recent warnings against using Tylenol during pregnancy due to a purported link to autism, medical experts and physician groups are pushing back. They emphasize that the scientific evidence for such a connection is uncertain and inconclusive, with major studies showing no causal link. Experts in maternal-fetal medicine stress that untreated fever or pain during pregnancy poses known risks to both the mother and fetus, and that acetaminophen remains one of the safest available options. They advise concerned parents to consult their medical providers rather than making decisions based on political statements.</p>

It also contrasts these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), noting that while HELOCs currently offer lower payments, their variable nature introduces long-term financial uncertainty.

This article suggests that threats from FCC Chair Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses are likely not the primary motivator, as such actions are historically rare and legally difficult. Instead, the station owners' decisions may be driven by a desire to remain in the FCC's good graces for future business deals, such as mergers and acquisitions. This dynamic creates a powerful incentive for self-censorship to align with the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>England has selected what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia. The squad features a formidable pace attack including Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Ben Stokes, signaling a strategic shift away from the style of bowling often used on previous tours. The selection aims to counter Australia's strengths on their home pitches, particularly in the opening Tests in Perth and Brisbane. The article notes that the fitness of key players, especially captain Ben Stokes, will be crucial to England's chances of reclaiming the urn.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that Rex Heuermann, the man accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, will be tried for all seven alleged murders in a single proceeding. Heuermann's defense team had argued for separate trials, citing disparities in the evidence across the different cases, which span nearly two decades. However, prosecutors successfully contended that an overlapping modus operandi and Heuermann's familiarity with the locations where the remains were found warranted a consolidated trial. The judge also denied a defense motion to exclude advanced DNA evidence from the case.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system starting in the 2026 season, officially bringing "robot umpires" to the highest level of the sport. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still calling balls and strikes but teams receiving two challenges per game to have a call reviewed by the ABS technology. The move, approved by MLB's competition committee, aims to improve accuracy and is expected to reduce ejections related to ball and strike disputes. The technology has been tested extensively in the minor leagues since 2019.</p>

          <p>A potential massive aircraft order from China is being viewed as a significant positive development for Boeing, according to financial analyst Jim Cramer. The deal is reportedly in the final stages of negotiation as part of a broader trade agreement between the U.S. and China. This follows a pattern where recent trade deals with countries like Japan, South Korea, and Qatar have included substantial orders for Boeing jets. The prospect of renewed business with China, a major market, is seen as a key reason for a bullish outlook on the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has forcefully pushed back against accusations that the central bank's decisions are politically motivated, calling such claims a "cheap shot." Without naming President Trump directly, Powell addressed the ongoing pressure campaign from the White House, which has sought to influence the Fed's interest rate policies. His comments come amid an intense battle over the Fed's independence, with the administration attempting to reshape its board of governors. Powell reiterated that the Fed's decisions are driven by economic data, not political considerations.</p>

          <p>Infections from highly drug-resistant bacteria, often called "nightmare bacteria," have increased by nearly 70% in the U.S. between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from CDC scientists. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort treatments. Researchers suggest the surge may be linked to increased antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report warns of a grave public health danger, as common infections could become difficult or impossible to treat, and community spread is a growing concern.</p>
