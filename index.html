          <p>Chinese electric carmaker Nio's Hong Kong-listed shares surged over 14% on Monday, marking their seventh consecutive session of gains. This significant rally follows the recent unveiling of the new ES8 SUV, priced affordably at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, making it one of Nio's most accessible models. The company is strategically expanding its offerings amid intense competition in China's electric vehicle sector, having also launched cheaper brands like Onvo and Firefly to capture a broader customer base beyond its traditional high-end focus. This article highlights Nio's efforts to diversify its market presence, with ES8 deliveries anticipated to begin in late September, indicating a positive market response to its strategic shifts.</p>

          <p>North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) fighters on Sunday intercepted a Russian Il-20 surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) for the third time within the past week.

An ADIZ is a defined stretch of international airspace requiring ready identification of all aircraft for national security interests.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021 and falling below economists' forecasts. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, driven by a decrease in retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) projects inflation to remain moderate in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price hikes. This article suggests the latest data strengthens the case for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in its upcoming October meeting, serving as a buffer if economic growth weakens and indicating inflation is no longer a primary obstacle.

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper, known for brands like Dr Pepper and Green Mountain Coffee, is set to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in an approximately $18 billion deal. This strategic acquisition aims to bolster Keurig Dr Pepper's struggling U.S. coffee business, which has seen declining sales in its single-serve pods and coffee makers. Following the takeover, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies at the earliest opportunity, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This article details the significant industry move, which is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years and create a coffee company with $16 billion in annual net sales, reshaping the market.
