          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's tariffs, asserting they won't significantly raise consumer prices. He claimed other countries bear much of the tariff burden due to inelastic supply, leading them to negotiate with the U.S. Trump's tariffs, including a 10% tariff on all imports, have sparked market volatility and retaliatory measures from trading partners. Hassett maintains that the tariffs are necessary to address long-run trade deficits and are prompting other nations to come to the negotiation table. (not investment advice)

          <p>An internal White House investigation revealed that *The Atlantic*'s Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to a Signal group chat discussing plans for US strikes in Yemen. The error stemmed from National Security Advisor Mike Waltz accidentally saving Goldberg's number under the contact for Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes, after Goldberg emailed the Trump campaign. The incident, which involved discussions of a military operation on an unclassified system, triggered a forensic review and nearly cost Waltz his job. Despite the breach, Trump decided against firing Waltz, partially to avoid giving the media a victory.</p>

Nissan is considering shifting some US-bound production to the US, while Stellantis will temporarily close its Canadian plant due to the tariffs.

          <p>An assistant editor at *The Atlantic* recommends B.J. Novak's *Vengeance* as a film that accurately captures the complexities of the American South, contrasting it with other portrayals that often rely on stereotypes. The film's portrayal of the North-South disconnect is praised, and it pays homage to the honey-butter chicken biscuit. The author appreciates that Novak spent time in West Texas to better understand its people, resulting in a film that is both funny and insightful.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author reflects on the challenges of parenting in the face of climate change and finds inspiration in foraminifera, single-celled organisms that have survived numerous mass extinction events. By studying these tiny creatures and their ability to adapt to specific environments, the author learns the importance of focusing on local, place-based conservation efforts. This realization helps her to reconnect with her immediate surroundings and find agency in caring for both her daughter and the planet.</p>

          <h2>The Comfort Class's Disconnect From Financial Realities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 08:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author argues that America suffers from a class apartheid, with systems dominated by a "comfort class" disconnected from the financial realities of most Americans. This disconnect leads to policies and rhetoric that fail to address the concerns of working-class individuals, contributing to social and political unrest. The author highlights the need for greater awareness and understanding of class dynamics to bridge the gap between the powerful and the rest of the population.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Americans to "hang tough" as the 10% universal tariffs on U.S. imports went into effect. He described the tariffs as an "economic revolution" aimed at bringing back jobs and businesses. The tariffs, along with reciprocal tariffs on imports from other nations, have sent global markets plummeting. China has retaliated by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products. Trump claims that China has been hit harder by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Texas is on the verge of passing America's largest school voucher scheme, providing parents with $10,000 annually for private school tuition. Governor Gregg Abbott, who made the bill his top priority, successfully ousted Republican opponents in primary challenges. The bill has cleared committee, signaling its likely passage, which Abbott plans to celebrate with a "Texas-sized party".

          <p>Stanley Plumly's poem "Chickadee" reflects on the simple beauty of nature and the contrast between the sublime and the small. The poem evokes the image of chickadees filling a feeder outside a kitchen window during winter, providing a sense of warmth and life amidst the cold. It contrasts this with the grandeur of a hawk and the vastness of the sky, suggesting a preference for the intimate and tangible aspects of the natural world.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's directive to remove "improper ideology" from the Smithsonian Institution, including the National Zoo, the author investigates potential targets of the order. The author explores various exhibits, looking for signs of political bias or controversial content. While some panels touch on sensitive topics, such as the impact of European colonists on turkey populations, the author finds little evidence to support the notion that the zoo is promoting divisive or anti-American ideologies.</p>
