          <p>Moody's Ratings lowered the United States' credit rating by one notch, citing concerns over the increasing government debt and high interest rates, which pose a significant budgetary challenge. The ratings agency highlighted that the debt and interest payment ratios have risen over the past decade to levels exceeding those of similarly rated countries. The U.S. is currently grappling with a substantial budget deficit, exacerbated by rising interest costs on Treasury debt, driven by higher interest rates and increased borrowing. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield experienced a slight increase following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a large-scale manhunt. According to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office, the inmates, one of whom has been apprehended, are considered armed and dangerous and may have received assistance from jail workers. Sheriff Susan Hutson cited defective locks and security failures as contributing factors, noting that a toilet had been removed from a cell wall, possibly with inside help. Officials are investigating multiple security breaches and are working to determine who aided the escape, with the district attorney considering a grand jury investigation.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in May declined for the fourth consecutive month, despite President Trump's rollback of some tariffs. The University of Michigan survey data indicates that consumer attitudes are nearing their lowest levels since a severe bout of inflation three years prior. The decline is attributed to inflation fears and recession warnings triggered by Trump's initial tariff implementations. Despite a recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China, which eased some tariffs, uncertainty remains due to ongoing tariffs and potential price increases, particularly for perishable imports and electronics.</p>

While lexicologists note that "86" commonly means to eliminate or throw out, particularly in restaurant settings, it can also refer to killing someone. Trump and his advisors, including Tulsi Gabbard and Kristi Noem, accused Comey of inciting violence, prompting investigations by the Homeland Security Department and the Secret Service. Comey has since stated that he did not intend any violent message.</p>

          <p>Months after the Los Angeles County fires, the safety of swimming at L.A.’s beaches remains a complex question. While tests have not revealed fire-related contamination levels that pose significant health risks, the scale of ecological damage caused by the fires dwarfs current pollution measurement tools. The existing water safety testing is designed for sewage, not fire debris, and there are no established health guidelines for safe exposure levels to fire-related contaminants. This lack of clear guidelines has made it difficult for public health officials to provide definitive answers about beach safety.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump launched a series of social media attacks targeting the Supreme Court, fellow Republicans, and several celebrities. He criticized Bruce Springsteen, accusing him of speaking negatively about the President in a foreign country. Trump also accused the Supreme Court of being "played" and admonished Republicans in Congress threatening to derail his legislative agenda. He even took a swipe at Taylor Swift, claiming she's no longer "HOT" and taking credit for her purported decline.</p>

          <p>Airlines, hotels, and analysts are forecasting a weak tourism season in the United States, influenced by threats of tariffs and unpopular policy decisions. Canadian travel to the U.S. has declined for three consecutive months, and airlines have reduced fares due to softening demand. Hotel chains like Marriott, Hyatt, and Hilton are experiencing slower growth and have lowered revenue outlooks. Political and economic confusion created by the Trump administration’s “America First” agenda is causing both domestic and international tourists to reconsider their travel plans, leading to a projected $12.5 billion loss in travel spending.</p>

The government's lack of a plan to manage the policy's impact on hospitals, states, and families highlighted the potential for chaos and legal challenges. The Fourteenth Amendment's citizenship clause was added to the U.S. Constitution in 1868 in part to overturn Dred Scott v.
