          <p>This article examines the difficulties the U.S. faces in implementing industrial policy, particularly in containing China and revitalizing American manufacturing. It highlights the contradiction between these goals and restrictive immigration policies, exemplified by a raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia targeting workers with alleged visa issues. The author argues that these policies, driven by anti-immigrant sentiment, undermine efforts to reshore manufacturing, especially in advanced sectors like semiconductors. The article suggests that the U.S. needs to address its labor shortages and immigration policies to effectively compete globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Green Bay Packers started their season with a 2-0 record after defeating the Washington Commanders 27-18 at Lambeau Field. The Packers' defense stifled the Commanders' offense, forcing them to punt on their first three possessions. Jordan Love led the Packers' offense, connecting with Romeo Doubs and Tucker Kraft for touchdowns, while Josh Jacobs contributed with a rushing touchdown. Despite a late effort from the Commanders, the Packers maintained control and secured the victory in their first home night game of the season.</p>

The incident occurred during Kirk's "American Comeback" tour when a single shot was fired from the roof of a nearby building, hitting Kirk in the neck. Authorities are searching for a suspect described as being of college age, and have released photos of a person of interest. The FBI has recovered a rifle believed to be used in the shooting, and Utah's governor has vowed to pursue the death penalty if the suspect is caught, highlighting the seriousness of the crime.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has cautioned Mexico against increasing tariffs on cars made in Asia, particularly China, to 50%. The ministry stated that it would take necessary measures to protect its interests if Mexico proceeds with the tariff hike, which is part of a broader budget proposal. This comes amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., with China emphasizing the importance of free trade and warning against actions that could harm economic cooperation between China and Mexico.

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a contentious housing bill that allows for increased housing density near public transit stops, overriding local zoning laws. The bill, introduced by Sen. Scott Wiener, aims to address California's housing shortage by permitting taller buildings near transit corridors. Critics argue that it strips local authorities of control and will negatively impact single-family neighborhoods. The bill gained support after amendments were added to include union hiring on certain projects, and it now awaits a final Senate vote and the governor's signature.</p>
