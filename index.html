          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," calling it "outrageous" and "pork-filled," leading to a clash with GOP leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the bill, stating Musk is "flat wrong," while acknowledging their friendship and policy differences. The Senate is proceeding with the legislation despite Musk's criticism, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune downplaying Musk's influence. Musk's opposition stems from concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit and specific provisions like the electric vehicle tax credit. This situation underscores the divisions within the Republican party regarding fiscal policy and the influence of external figures like Musk. </p>

          <p>The FDA will review the latest data on mifepristone at the request of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., raising concerns about access to the abortion pill. The review follows a report questioning the drug's safety, though experts argue such concerns are misguided. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review deemed it safe and effective, and has been used by over 5 million patients. This review comes after the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the pill's availability in 2024, preserving access to the drug. The review's impact on access remains unclear, but it highlights the ongoing political and medical debate surrounding reproductive healthcare.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's "Beige Book" report indicates that the U.S. economy has slightly declined over the past six weeks, with slow hiring and rising prices. The report cites "elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty" as factors contributing to cautious business and household decisions. Hiring was largely unchanged, with many districts reporting flat employment amid increased applicant pools and lower turnover rates. The report also notes that higher tariff rates are putting upward pressure on costs and prices, with businesses expecting these increases to be passed on to consumers within three months. This paints a picture of economic challenges and uncertainty, particularly related to trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government is exploring a simplified process to designate countries of origin as safe, aiming to decrease the number of asylum seekers. Chancellor Merz's Cabinet has approved a draft policy that would allow a country to be declared safe through a simple statutory order, without requiring the consent of the Bundesrat. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that this measure is part of a broader set of national initiatives to implement an "asylum turnaround." Under German asylum law, safe countries of origin are those where individuals are not subject to political persecution or inhuman punishment, and migrants from these countries are less likely to have their asylum applications approved.</p>

          <p>According to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, President Trump's proposed tariff plan would reduce the deficit by $2.8 trillion over ten years but would also shrink the economy. The CBO estimates that the tariffs would increase the average annual inflation rate by 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026. The analysis assumes that the tariffs, implemented through executive action, will remain in place permanently. While the deficit would decrease, household wealth would also decline, and the GDP growth rate would be reduced by 0.06 percentage points per year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is facing scrutiny as critics argue it would roll back key provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill could cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage and make it harder to sign up for health plans on ACA marketplaces. While Republicans avoid framing it as an ACA repeal, the bill includes measures that would significantly reduce access to healthcare. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could leave 11 million more people without health insurance by 2034. This bill represents a significant shift in healthcare policy and could have substantial impacts on Americans' access to coverage.</p>

Experts say the tariffs could increase costs on everything from homes and cars to household and office supplies. While the U.S. has a domestic metals manufacturing sector, it still relies on imports to fill gaps. The increased tariffs are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, but they could also have negative consequences for consumers.
