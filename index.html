            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering forming a task force to address potential supply chain disruptions resulting from tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. The task force would include key figures like the Vice President, Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and U.S. Trade Representative. This move comes as the administration anticipates challenges in sectors such as medicines, semiconductors, and critical minerals due to retaliatory tariffs between the U.S. and China. The escalating trade war has raised concerns among investors about inflation and economic slowdown, prompting the administration to proactively address potential disruptions.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status amid disputes over antisemitism on campus and compliance with administration demands. Legal experts note that revoking tax-exempt status is a complex process, citing the case of Bob Jones University as a potential precedent. Harvard argues there is no legal basis for such an action, stating it would severely impact its educational mission and financial aid programs. The administration's actions follow a freeze on federal funding and pressure to release disciplinary records of international students.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government has released thousands of files related to the 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, including handwritten notes by the assassin, Sirhan Sirhan. The notes reveal Sirhan's obsession with killing Kennedy and his determination to eliminate him, mirroring the fate of his brother, John F. Kennedy. The released documents also include interviews with people who knew Sirhan, providing insights into his political convictions and mental state. The release of these files aligns with President Trump's commitment to transparency regarding high-profile assassinations and investigations.</p>

            <p>The Australian government is shooting koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park due to starvation and injuries caused by a recent bushfire, which exacerbated existing habitat loss issues. The government states that euthanasia is necessary to end the koalas' suffering, but animal welfare advocates criticize the approach as indiscriminate. The underlying issues of habitat loss due to logging and development, as well as climate change contributing to more frequent and severe wildfires, are highlighted as key factors in the koalas' plight. Experts emphasize the need for rescue efforts and long-term solutions, such as habitat preservation and climate action.</p>
