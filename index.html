          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old Silicon Valley semiconductor company, is experiencing a significant surge in its market valuation and stock price, driven by its specialized purple active electrical cables (AECs) that are crucial for high-performance AI data centers. Major hyperscalers, including Elon Musk's xAI, Amazon, and Microsoft, are increasingly adopting these cables, which analysts predict will fuel substantial revenue growth for Credo through 2028, with sales potentially nearing $1 billion. The company's unique AEC technology offers enhanced reliability over traditional fiber optics by preventing "link flaps," positioning it as a key supplier in the expanding trillion-dollar AI infrastructure market. Despite its impressive growth, Credo's future remains susceptible to potential spending pullbacks from major cloud providers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:52:54 EDT</div>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its sixth known boat strike in the Caribbean Sea since last month, with officials confirming survivors aboard the vessel, which President Trump described as a "drug-carrying submarine." Two individuals were rescued by a Navy helicopter and transported to a U.S. Navy ship, marking the first known survivors from these operations that have previously resulted in at least 27 fatalities. The administration justifies the strikes as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels, amid a wider military buildup targeting Venezuela, whose president, Nicolás Maduro, is accused of drug trafficking. The legality and evidence supporting these strikes have faced scrutiny from lawmakers and human rights experts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court injunction blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, arguing that the injunction impedes presidential authority and endangers federal personnel. Solicitor General John Sauer urged immediate administrative action, citing the pressing risk of violence. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, questioning the administration's ability to prove a "rebellion" against the U.S. government. This ongoing legal battle highlights significant constitutional tensions between federal and state powers regarding military force deployment within domestic borders.</p>

          <h2>Northern Metropolis Urged to Prioritize Culture Beyond Tech Hub Status</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:30:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis should evolve beyond a mere tech and housing hub to become a significant zone for cultural emancipation within the Greater Bay Area, rather than just another new town. The article contends that Hong Kong's development thinking has been overly focused on transport infrastructure, while the current era demands a shift towards cultural influence and innovation, especially given the sophisticated technological hardware already present. By prioritizing cultural content creation and moving past a property-led development model, the Metropolis could elevate the region's global standing and foster a unique identity. This approach would address deeper societal needs beyond economic growth.</p>

          <p>Shares of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk fell after President Trump stated his administration aims to cap the cost of brand-name GLP-1 weight loss drugs at $150 per month, a significant reduction from their current list prices. Trump highlighted the stark disparity between U.S. and international drug costs, indicating a strong push for drugmakers to align prices with those in other developed nations. This proposal, if implemented, could make popular medications like Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy competitive with cheaper compounded alternatives, potentially impacting pharmaceutical companies' revenues while significantly increasing consumer access and affordability. The administration is actively engaging in price discussions with drugmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of more "cockroaches," indicating a broader concern about credit quality and the opaque nature of NDFI lending, where losses can be sudden and severe.

          <p>The Trump administration announced it will freeze an additional $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects in Democratic states, escalating pressure amidst the ongoing government shutdown. White House budget director Russell Vought stated the Army Corps of Engineers would pause "low priority" work in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Boston, with projects potentially facing cancellation. This article highlights the administration's strategy to target political opposition by impacting critical infrastructure, including water systems and bridge expansions, predominantly in states that voted against Trump in the 2024 election.
