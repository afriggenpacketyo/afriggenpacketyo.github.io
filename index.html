          <p>Authorities in East Sussex have released images of two individuals they wish to identify in connection with a suspected arson attack at a mosque in Peacehaven. The incident, which is being investigated as a hate crime, caused damage to the building's entrance and a vehicle, though no one was injured. A volunteer stated that two people were inside the mosque at the time but managed to escape the fire. Community leaders have condemned the act, calling for unity and highlighting the increased need for security at all places of worship following other recent attacks.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined the U.S. approach to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, emphasizing a two-phase plan for peace. The immediate priority is the logistical arrangement for the release of all hostages, a framework Hamas has reportedly accepted, which requires a cessation of bombardments to proceed. The second, more complex phase involves establishing a new governing body in Gaza composed of Palestinian technocrats, free from terrorist influence, which Rubio acknowledged would require significant time and international support. He stressed that a permanent end to hostilities is contingent on ensuring Gaza can no longer be used as a base for terrorist activities against Israel.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has defended her leadership strategy, stating that she is willing to accept a temporary drop in opinion polls to formulate well-thought-out policies, unlike rival parties Labour and Reform UK. As her party's conference begins, she outlined a plan to remove 750,000 illegal migrants by banning them from claiming asylum and leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to expedite deportations. Badenoch asserted that this methodical approach will ultimately prove effective, even as she faces internal and external pressure over the party's declining support and the rise of Reform UK.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new powers that will allow police to impose conditions on recurring protests, considering their cumulative impact on communities. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the measures are about placing restrictions, not banning protests, in response to concerns from communities, particularly the Jewish community, who feel intimidated by repeated demonstrations. The move follows the arrest of nearly 500 protesters supporting the banned group Palestine Action. Critics, including the Liberal Democrats and Amnesty International, argue the new rules could undermine the fundamental right to peaceful protest without effectively addressing hate speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has become a dominant force in social media political advertising, outspending entire countries' political parties combined. An analysis by the think-tank Political Capital reveals that Fidesz's spending on platforms like Facebook and YouTube far exceeds that of its domestic opposition and even the total political ad expenditure in larger nations like Poland and Czechia during their election periods. As social media platforms begin to ban political ads, Orban's party is pivoting to a new strategy, mobilizing a network of online activists, or "digital freedom fighters," to maintain its influence.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza conflict are intensifying as negotiators prepare for crucial talks in Egypt, even as Israeli military operations continue in the region. The U.S.-backed 20-point peace plan proposes an immediate cessation of fighting and the exchange of 48 hostages for hundreds of Palestinian detainees, a framework Hamas has cautiously engaged with after pressure from regional mediators. However, an Israeli government spokesperson clarified that no formal ceasefire is in place, and defensive military actions will continue. The talks are seen as highly consequential for establishing a potential path toward ending the prolonged and devastating war.</p>

          <p>A cluster of small earthquakes, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near Big Bear Lake in San Bernardino County, California, from late Saturday into Sunday morning.

Brown suggests that effective communication involves clarity, accountability, and choosing direct conversation over text to avoid misinterpretation of tone. To help navigate conflict, experts recommend phrases that validate the other person's perspective and show you are actively listening, such as "It sounds like what's most important to you is..."</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Union secured Major League Soccer's Supporters' Shield, awarded for the best regular-season record, after a 1-0 victory against New York City FC. A goal from Danish striker Mikael Uhre in the 40th minute was enough to clinch the title, guaranteeing the Union the top seed heading into the postseason playoffs. The achievement marks a significant turnaround for the club under coach Bradley Carnell, who took over in January after the team failed to make the playoffs last season. Carnell credited the entire organization for the successful season, highlighting the team's investment from day one.</p>

          <p>The Wayne National Forest, Ohio's sole national forest, is facing the threat of large-scale logging under a Trump administration executive order aimed at increasing timber production on 100 million acres of federal land. The administration has cited wildfire prevention as a reason for the move, but environmental groups and local advocates argue that clear-cutting in Ohio is not an effective fire mitigation strategy. They warn that logging could destabilize soil containing coal waste from past mining operations, potentially polluting waterways and increasing flood risks in the Appalachian region.</p>

          <p>Democrats have coalesced around healthcare as their central demand in the ongoing government shutdown, using it as their primary leverage against the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. Activists and party leaders are framing the fight as a necessary stand to protect the Affordable Care Act's subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, issues that resonate strongly with their base. While the strategy carries political risks, many Democrats believe it is their best opportunity to rein in the president and rebuild trust with voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Polling suggests the public is currently more inclined to blame Republicans for the shutdown.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is advancing a program to integrate AI-piloted drones, like the XQ-58, to fly alongside human pilots, representing a potential revolution in aerial combat.

These AI drones are designed to process vast amounts of data quickly and can be deployed in high-risk environments, though military leaders insist that humans will retain control over life-or-death decisions for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>A woman was shot by federal agents in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood after, according to the Department of Homeland Security, agents were boxed in and rammed by multiple vehicles. DHS stated that one of the drivers was armed, prompting agents to open fire and strike the woman, who was later taken into custody. The incident led to a tense standoff between protesters and a heavy presence of federal law enforcement, with agents using pepper balls and one pointing a weapon at the crowd from an armored vehicle.

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more weight than the actual words spoken, and a sharp or sarcastic tone can quickly escalate a minor issue into a major conflict. To de-escalate, he advises individuals to become self-aware, apologize for unintended harshness, and rephrase their statements. When on the receiving end, one should calmly ask their partner to try again with a different tone, interrupting the negative cycle without becoming defensive.</p>

While this could save companies significant time and money, it poses a major threat to the revenue of the "Big Four" accounting firms—Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC—which could lose a substantial portion of their audit business. Proponents argue the change would reduce regulatory burdens and encourage more private companies to go public, potentially offsetting some of the accounting firms' losses. (not investment advice)</p>
