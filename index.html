          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly kept its key interest rate at 3.85%, diverging from economists' predictions of a rate cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time to assess incoming data and confirm that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2.5% target. Recent monthly inflation indicators were slightly stronger than anticipated, although the annual rate remains at a four-year low. The decision comes as Australia's economy faces a slowdown, with weaker consumer demand and shrinking public spending contributing to lower-than-expected growth in the first quarter.

          <p>Indonesia’s Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki volcano on Flores island has erupted again, sending a towering ash cloud 18 kilometers into the sky and triggering further evacuations. Authorities have raised the alert to the highest level, expanding the exclusion zone to a 7km radius and warning of potential lahar mudflows. The eruption disrupted air travel, with dozens of flights to and from Bali cancelled. Over 4,000 residents have been evacuated, but those remaining face shortages of clean water and food as thick volcanic ash blankets the region.</p>

          <p>Beijing has cautioned the Trump administration against reinstating tariffs on Chinese goods, threatening to take firm action if trade tensions escalate. The warning comes as President Trump prepares to impose sharply higher U.S. tariffs on multiple countries starting in August. China's state-run media emphasized that dialogue is the only correct path but affirmed that the country will uphold its principled positions to protect its interests. The commentary also targeted nations striking supply chain deals with the U.S. that exclude China, stating that Beijing would "respond resolutely" to any such agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed a widespread increase in import tariffs but has notified 14 countries of new, specific levy rates effective August 1. President Trump renewed threats of a 25% tax on goods from Japan and South Korea and outlined rates for other nations, including a 40% tariff on items from Myanmar and Laos. While the move extends a previous 90-day pause, it signals a firm stance on trade, which economists warn could raise consumer prices in the U.S. International partners like Japan and South Korea have expressed regret but stated they will continue negotiations.

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed hearing loss in a clinical trial involving both children and adults with a specific genetic mutation. The research, published in Nature Medicine, involved delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear. All ten participants showed considerable hearing improvement within six months, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope that similar treatments could one day be developed for other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

The rising costs of materials and electronic components are severely hampering Russia's goal of becoming self-sufficient in aviation. To cope with the inability to purchase from Boeing and Airbus, Russian airlines have resorted to a gray market for smuggled parts and manufacturing counterfeit components, raising significant safety concerns.

The study identifies cities like San Bernardino, California, where parking lots comprise nearly half the downtown area, creating vast, poorly regulated "danger zones." Major contributing factors include driver distraction, with a high percentage of drivers admitting to using phones or texting, and design flaws like poor lighting and unclear markings. The report suggests safety improvements for both property owners and drivers, such as enhanced visibility and the use of backup cameras.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominated U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, praising his efforts in the Middle East. The meeting's primary focus was expected to be a push for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas ongoing. Netanyahu also addressed the future of Gaza, suggesting Palestinians should have the "free choice" to leave, while Trump indicated he hoped not to strike Iran again. The discussion also touched on Ukraine, with Trump stating he would resume sending weapons to help them defend against Russia.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% decline in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of analyst expectations. The South Korean tech giant is struggling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a key component for AI processors dominated by leader Nvidia. The disappointing forecast is attributed to losses in its foundry business and delays in getting its advanced HBM chips certified by major customers. This puts Samsung behind competitors like SK Hynix and Micron in the lucrative and rapidly growing AI chip market. (not investment advice)</p>

As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund tuition to hundreds of students and agreed to greater transparency in its marketing. The move is a significant development in the scrutiny of online program managers that partner with prestigious universities to sell courses of sometimes questionable quality.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The VA is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, which has eliminated the need for the previously considered RIF. The initial plan, which aimed to cut the workforce by up to 15%, had drawn criticism from some lawmakers who worried about the impact on veterans' care and a toxic work environment contributing to staff losses.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has activated another flight route, W121, near the median line of the Taiwan Strait, a move made without consulting Taipei that has raised alarms in Taiwan. This is the last of three branch routes off the main M503 flight path, which at its closest point is only 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial dividing line. Beijing claims the new route is a technical adjustment to improve air traffic safety and efficiency. However, Taipei views the unilateral action as a potential security risk and a further escalation of pressure on the self-governed island.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and FBI has concluded that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that investigators found no evidence of a "client list" or of him blackmailing prominent individuals. The findings, detailed in a memo, aimed to address years of public speculation and conspiracy theories. The review confirmed that video footage showed no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death. The DOJ stated that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no purpose and that no further disclosure of materials is warranted.</p>

Kershaw expressed gratitude for the "tremendous honor," calling the selection "weird but cool." While his limited workload would not normally warrant a spot, his performance has been solid, and the pick celebrates his status as a future Hall of Famer.</p>

Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to participants who faced potential fines. The march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>

          <p>The chief inspector of prisons has warned that an overwhelming amount of drugs being smuggled into prisons is severely destabilizing the system and undermining rehabilitation efforts. A new report finds that criminal gangs are using drones and other methods to supply contraband to inmates, leading to "uncontrolled levels of criminality" that inexperienced staff cannot contain. Overcrowding and a lack of purposeful activities contribute to the problem, with 39% of surveyed prisoners saying it was easy to get drugs. The watchdog called the issue a threat that needs to be taken seriously.</p>
