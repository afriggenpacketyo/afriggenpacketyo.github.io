          <p>A property developer has been engaged in an eight-year legal fight with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family over a multi-million pound penthouse in Mayfair, London. The dispute, documented in High Court filings, began over a lift installation and has since escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched refurbishments, and a noisy lift being run at night. The article situates the conflict within the context of Al Fayed's famously combative business style and also references the building's connection to past allegations of sexual assault against him.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive rally. An early six-run deficit, largely due to a difficult outing for pitcher Dustin May, proved too much to overcome. The team showed signs of life by scoring five runs in the sixth and seventh innings, and Shohei Ohtani hit a notable home run into McCovey's Cove. However, the team's inability to complete the comeback further shrinks their division lead as they continue to struggle.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece by Raja Shehadeh contends that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah amounts to a crime against humanity. The author argues that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians since 1948, rendering institutions ineffective in preventing the horrors occurring in Gaza. He places hope not in legal frameworks but in the power of Palestinian resilience and the belief that the truth of their suffering will eventually emerge and hold Israel and its allies accountable.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the former Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to multiple charges including drug trafficking and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. Prosecutors stated that Guzman Lopez, known as "El Raton," admitted to his role in leading the cartel alongside his three brothers after their father's 2016 arrest. As part of a plea deal, he will cooperate with authorities and forfeit $80 million in assets, facing a reduced sentence for his crimes.</p>

          <p>A proposal by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle and replace a 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague is facing significant opposition from preservationists. Critics, including architects and a foundation of experts, argue the iconic Vysehrad bridge is a key part of the city's panorama and can be repaired in place, a view endorsed by UNESCO. The authority contends that a new, wider bridge with a third track is necessary to handle projected increases in rail traffic, promising to move the old structure for use as a pedestrian crossing elsewhere.</p>
