          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly terminated at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, the firings targeted individuals identified by a departmental working group and included support staff who may have had minor roles. This action has reportedly caused significant concern among career employees at the DOJ, reminiscent of previous purges during the Trump presidency.</p>

          <p>The family of Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Tampa, Florida, reports he was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.

The U.S. State Department confirmed the death of a citizen and is providing consular assistance, while the family is demanding a direct U.S. investigation into the killing.</p>

The arrests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester were primarily for showing support for a banned organization, which is now a criminal offense. The proscription followed an incident where activists damaged aircraft at an RAF base, but critics argue the government is misusing anti-terror legislation.</p>

          <p>During a visit to flood-damaged areas in Texas, President Trump responded to a reporter's question about the timeliness of emergency alerts by calling the inquiry "evil." The reporter had conveyed the concerns of some families who felt that earlier warnings could have saved lives. Trump defended the official response to the disaster as "heroism" and suggested that it was inappropriate to question the handling of the situation under the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England have initiated a legal challenge against the government, campaigning for a mandatory ban on smartphones in all schools. They are seeking a judicial review, arguing that the current guidance, which allows individual headteachers to set their own policies, is unlawful and fails to protect children from dangers like cyberbullying and harmful content. The Department for Education responded that schools already possess the power to ban phones.</p>

          <p>The killing of a 21-year-old U.S. citizen, Sayfollah Musallet, allegedly by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, has intensified focus on the region's rising tensions. This article places the event in the broader context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noting the historical rarity of prosecutions for settler violence. It also points to internal criticism within the U.S. Justice Department over perceived disparities in how it investigates crimes committed by various parties in the region.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed a baffling cockpit event where both engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position just after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other pilot denying he had done so. This action, normally performed only after landing, starved the engines of fuel and is now a central focus of the investigation.</p>

          <p>Officials in Travis County, Texas, have ordered the complete closure of Lake Travis to all public activities, including recreational, commercial, and navigational use. The decision follows recent severe flash floods that have left the lake with hazardous debris, high bacteria levels, and dangerously fast-flowing water. The closure, which only exempts emergency responders, will remain in effect until the public safety threat has subsided.</p>
