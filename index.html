          <p>Two-time Olympic medalist Fred Kerley was arrested in Miami for allegedly punching his ex-girlfriend, Alaysha Johnson, at a hotel in Dania Beach, Florida. Kerley was scheduled to compete in the Grand Slam Track meeting but was charged with battery. He appeared in court, posted a $1,000 bond, and was released. Kerley's arrest has raised concerns about violence and abuse in sports, and the potential impact on his career and reputation, as well as Johnson's well-being.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease. The drug, traditionally used for type 2 diabetes, was administered to participants diagnosed with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). After 72 weeks, 62.9% of participants experienced reduced inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, compared to only 34.3% in the placebo group. While some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group, researchers are optimistic about its potential as a new treatment option for fatty liver disease.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has banned imports from Pakistan in response to a deadly attack on tourists in Kashmir. The ban, effective immediately, is imposed in the interest of national security and public policy. Pakistan, in turn, has conducted a training launch of a surface-to-surface missile.

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), a school leaders' union, is taking legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The NAHT seeks a judicial review of the plans for new school report cards, arguing they represent another crude grading system. This action follows concerns raised by educators, including the sister of Ruth Perry, a head teacher who died by suicide after an Ofsted inspection, who fear the changes will negatively impact the wellbeing of education staff. Ofsted maintains that the proposals aim to support mental health and calls the union's claims untenable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 25% tariff on key auto parts, including engines, impacting Japan's car industry. This measure follows the earlier imposition of a 25% tariff on automobiles. To mitigate the impact, the administration is offering manufacturers assistance to relocate supply chains for car parts used in the United States. Japan, a major exporter of vehicles and auto parts to the U.S., faces significant economic consequences from these tariffs, which could disrupt trade relations and affect the global automotive market.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, injured nearly 50 people, including an 11-year-old child.

The attacks underscore the ongoing conflict and the continued targeting of civilian areas, prompting calls for increased international pressure on Russia to end the war.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, envisioned by former President Nana Akufo-Addo, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy.

The new government has halted funding and launched an anti-corruption initiative, leaving the half-finished cathedral as a major target. The project has drawn criticism from citizens and religious leaders alike, who question the use of public funds for a cathedral amid pressing economic needs.</p>

South Korea's KF-21, while currently a 4.5-generation fighter, is planned for upgrade to full stealth capabilities, while Turkey's TAI TF Kaan is claimed to be a fully fledged stealth fighter. These developments could make advanced stealth aircraft more accessible to countries previously unable to acquire them due to cost and geopolitical constraints.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts express skepticism about Ukraine's ability to supplant China as a leading supplier of critical minerals for the United States, despite a recent deal between the two countries. Most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in Russian-occupied territories, and extraction will take years due to limited processing capacity. China currently controls about 60% of the world's rare earth reserves and 90% of refining, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the near future. This reliance on China leaves American companies vulnerable amid ongoing trade disputes and supply restrictions.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people have died in Syria following violence that began with a blasphemous audio recording allegedly made by a member of the Druze minority. The unrest spread across several Druze-majority areas, prompting intervention by Syrian government forces. Israel has also conducted airstrikes in Syria, citing concerns for the Druze community and security. The situation is complicated by ongoing negotiations between the Druze community and the new Syrian government, as well as external interference, potentially destabilizing the country's transition.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an 'unparalleled' antivenom using the blood of a US man, Tim Friede, who has been deliberately injecting himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Antibodies in Friede's blood have demonstrated protection against fatal doses from various venomous snakes in animal tests. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's mission could lead to a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. Friede's dedication stems from a desire to improve snakebite treatments, particularly for those in remote areas.</p>

Garcia acknowledged his year-long layoff impacted his performance and expressed interest in a rematch with Romero or a fight with Haney. The bout was best summed up by Scotland's former undisputed light-welterweight world champion Josh Taylor, who said on social media that Haney looked "terrified" and "frantic".</p>
