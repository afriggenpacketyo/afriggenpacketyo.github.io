          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the recently fired director of the CDC, has accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "weaponizing public health for political gain." Through her lawyers, Monarez stated she was targeted for refusing to approve "unscientific, reckless directives" and is contesting the legality of her dismissal, arguing only the president can fire her. The standoff highlights a deep rift within the administration over the direction of the nation's top public health agency.</p>

          <p>Researchers are analyzing the DNA of the "Druids Oak," an 800-year-old tree in Buckinghamshire, to understand how ancient oaks survive for centuries. The project, led by The Woodland Trust, aims to identify the genetic traits responsible for their remarkable resilience to disease, climate change, and other threats. This genetic information could be vital for selecting the best trees to plant in the future, helping to restore Britain's woodlands and the diverse wildlife they support.</p>

These fabricated images and stories, often depicting fictional scenes from concentration camps, are distressing survivors and their families. The Auschwitz Memorial has condemned the practice as a "dangerous distortion" that disrespects the victims and turns a historical atrocity into an "emotional game" for online engagement.</p>

Citing "heightened safety concerns," Superintendent Alex Cherniss used his executive authority to halt the plan, stating that only the U.S. and California flags will be displayed for now. The initial 3-2 board vote was contentious, with supporters viewing it as a stand against antisemitism and opponents raising concerns about campus safety and political messaging.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before initiating the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, a BBC investigation has found. The government's claim that merging councils could save £2.9 billion was based on a 2020 report from a lobbyist group, the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting that some merger scenarios could result in no savings or even cost taxpayers money.</p>
