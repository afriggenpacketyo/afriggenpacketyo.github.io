          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's earnings fell 17% from the prior year, a period which included a significant gain from Visa shares, but still beat expectations when accounting for this. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the results while reiterating concerns about geopolitical risks and trade uncertainty. The positive report also led the bank to increase its guidance for net interest income for the full year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is voting on two significant cryptocurrency bills this week, aiming to establish a regulatory framework for the industry. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill, has already passed the Senate, while the more comprehensive CLARITY Act, which defines regulatory oversight between the SEC and CFTC, faces a more uncertain path. Some Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over how the Trump family's involvement in crypto could create conflicts of interest. The crypto industry, including major players like Coinbase, is heavily lobbying for the bills' passage to bring regulatory certainty and encourage investment.</p>

          <p>A grandfather and grandmother in Flintshire, UK, have been found guilty of murdering their two-year-old grandson, Ethan Ives-Griffiths. The toddler died in August 2021 from a catastrophic head injury while also being dangerously dehydrated and severely underweight. The boy's mother was also convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child and child cruelty. The court heard that Ethan was subjected to abuse and casual cruelty during the seven weeks he lived with his grandparents. The judge indicated that the grandparents face mandatory life sentences for the murder.</p>

          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, with both earnings and revenue beating estimates. The bank's performance was bolstered by a 16% year-over-year increase in markets revenue and an 18% rise in banking revenue. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as a positive sign for her ongoing turnaround plan for the company. However, the bank also reported a 16% growth in the cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook as a key factor for increasing its allowance for credit losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retail giant Target is experiencing a period of struggle, marked by stagnating sales, declining store traffic, and a falling stock price. This article explores the multifaceted issues contributing to the downturn, including a perceived loss of its "cheap chic" identity, inconsistent inventory, and reduced in-store service quality. Former employees and analysts suggest that cost-cutting measures and a shift away from its previous diversity and inclusion efforts have damaged morale and alienated some loyal customers.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a new multi-billion dollar weapons package for Ukraine and a threat of "severe tariffs" on Russia's trading partners, Russian officials have signaled indifference. Former president Dmitry Medvedev stated that "Russia didn't care" about the "theatrical ultimatum," while the Kremlin indicated it would take time to analyze the statements. The new U.S. aid reportedly includes 17 Patriot missile systems sourced from European allies. The White House also confirmed that President Trump had questioned Ukrainian President Zelenskyy about the possibility of striking Moscow, framing it as a question rather than an encouragement.</p>

The prolonged lack of rainfall, combined with record-breaking warm temperatures, has left many rivers at critically low levels, impacting the environment and agriculture.

          <p>Chinese tech giant Alibaba is reportedly planning to launch a "Super Saturdays" promotional event for its on-demand delivery services, escalating the price war with competitors like Meituan and JD.com. This move is part of a broader battle for market share in China's instant commerce sector, which is projected to grow into a multi-trillion yuan market by 2030. Rivals have also been offering aggressive discounts, such as free milk tea from Meituan and heavily subsidized crayfish from JD.com. The intense competition highlights the strategic importance of this rapidly expanding segment of the Chinese digital economy.</p>

          <p>Recent reports that a senior Pentagon official discouraged European allies from military involvement in the Indo-Pacific are being interpreted by some analysts as a strategic shift by Washington. This move could signal that the U.S. intends to ask its key Asian allies, such as Japan and South Korea, to shoulder more of the responsibility for militarily countering China in the region. According to one analyst, the U.S. still wants Europe to be tough on China economically but prefers to manage regional defense cooperation with its Indo-Pacific partners directly. This potential policy change reflects the complexities of managing global alliances against a rising China.</p>

          <p>The UK government has revealed the existence of a secret, multi-million-pound scheme that relocated thousands of Afghans to the UK after their personal data was inadvertently leaked by a Ministry of Defence official in 2022. The leak, which exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK assistance, was kept secret for over three years under a superinjunction. So far, 4,500 people have been moved under the £400 million Afghan Relocation Route. Defence Secretary John Healey issued a "sincere apology" for the "serious departmental error" as the details were made public following a High Court ruling.</p>

          <p>In the current elevated interest rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) against more liquid money market accounts. This article analyzes the potential earnings of a $5,000 deposit in both, finding that top money market accounts currently offer slightly higher rates than even five-year CDs. However, the key difference lies in rate stability; CD rates are fixed for the term, guaranteeing the return, while money market rates are variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve lowers rates. The choice depends on prioritizing a guaranteed return or flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

For individual taxpayers, the bill aims to encourage more giving from average Americans but also places new limits on deductions for the wealthiest donors. Specifically, itemizers will not be able to deduct the first 0.5% of their adjusted gross income given to charity, a move intended to offset other provisions. (not investment advice)</p>

While the court dismissed the specific lawsuit brought by relatives of individuals killed in a 2012 strike in Yemen, it established an important precedent. The ruling states that the German government has a duty to protect human rights abroad when there is a sufficient connection to German state authority and a risk of systematic international law violations. However, the court granted the government significant leeway in foreign policy, finding no such systematic violation in this instance.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the recently signed tax-and-spending bill, which extends the 2017 tax cuts, will increase federal deficits by at least $3.4 trillion over the next decade. This adds to a national debt that has already surpassed $36 trillion. Economists warn that persistent, large deficits can lead to higher interest rates for consumers on mortgages and credit cards, drive inflation, and reduce the government's budgetary flexibility for other priorities or future crises. While the bond market has remained stable for now, continued deficit spending poses long-term risks to the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>
