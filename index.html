          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 13:26:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Argentina have discovered a new species of megaraptoran dinosaur, named Joaquinraptor casali, which lived approximately 70 million years ago. The fossil, one of the most complete skeletons of this mysterious dinosaur group, was found in Patagonia with an ancient crocodile bone in its jaws. This finding provides crucial insights into its predatory behavior, suggesting it used its long arms and powerful claws for hunting, a different method from the bite-focused T. rex. The discovery helps fill a significant gap in the understanding of these unique predators from the late Cretaceous period.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has commented that by many measures, equity prices in the stock market seem "fairly highly valued." During a speech, he explained that the central bank monitors overall financial conditions to ensure its policies are achieving their intended goals. Despite acknowledging the lofty stock values, which have recently set record highs following an interest rate cut, Powell asserted that this is not a time of elevated financial stability risks. His remarks provide insight into the Fed's current assessment of the market environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced its decision to close all 19 of its till-free Amazon Fresh grocery stores in the United Kingdom, less than five years after their launch. The company plans to convert five of the locations into Whole Foods stores, a brand it also owns, while shifting its primary focus to online grocery delivery services through partnerships with Morrisons, Co-op, and others. The move affects 250 employees who have entered a consultation process, with Amazon offering redeployment opportunities where possible. Analysts suggest the closure reflects the highly competitive UK grocery market and Amazon's experimental approach to its physical store strategy.</p>

He accused the UN of being ineffective, stating it relies on "empty words" instead of action to solve conflicts. Trump also targeted European allies for purchasing Russian energy while opposing the war in Ukraine and urged nations to reject green energy initiatives, which he called a "scam." He touted his administration's achievements, claiming the U.S. is the "hottest country anywhere in the world."</p>

          <p>Following ABC's decision to reinstate "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," major local television station owners Nexstar and Sinclair have announced they will not air the program.

Both station groups, which control a significant portion of ABC's affiliate stations nationwide, cited the remarks as "inappropriate and deeply insensitive." Their decision means the show will be unavailable on dozens of local channels, highlighting a significant rift between the network and its affiliates.</p>

          <p>Numerous Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations across the United States have been canceled or postponed due to widespread fear within communities over the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns. Organizers in cities from Chicago to Sacramento cited concerns that large public gatherings could become targets for ICE raids, putting attendees at risk. The changed political climate, including an anti-diversity push, has created a sense of caution that is altering how the month-long observance is celebrated.

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a revised selection process for the H-1B visa program, which would prioritize applications from employers offering higher wages. This change would be implemented once the annual quota of 85,000 visas is met. The Department of Homeland Security stated the goal is to better protect American workers from unfair wage competition from foreign labor. This proposal follows the recent introduction of a controversial $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a move that has caused significant uncertainty for tech companies and skilled foreign workers, particularly from India.</p>

          <p>Amidst a political landscape dominated by an aging leadership in both parties, speculation is growing about a potential 2028 presidential or Senate run for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This article explores her political trajectory, noting her shift from an unapologetically left-wing insurgent to a more established figure within the Democratic party. While her charisma and appeal to voters seeking change are undeniable, her evolving positions, particularly on foreign policy, have drawn criticism from some of her original progressive base. The piece argues that despite these complexities, AOC's fighting spirit may be what is needed to challenge the current political establishment.</p>

          <p>The New York Liberty have announced they will not renew the contract of head coach Sandy Brondello, less than a year after she led the team to its first-ever WNBA championship. The decision comes after a season plagued by injuries to key players, which resulted in a first-round playoff loss to the Phoenix Mercury. Despite the disappointing end to the season, Brondello had the public support of her players. She leaves the organization as the winningest coach in franchise history, with a record of 107-53 over her four seasons with the team.</p>

          <p>Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker from Ethiopia, was sentenced to one year in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex.

His arrest triggered large demonstrations outside the hotel where he was housed. Kebatu was found guilty on multiple charges, and the Home Office has confirmed it will seek his deportation after he completes his sentence.

The company earns hundreds of millions annually by licensing the S&P 500 name and data to financial firms that create index funds and ETFs, which now hold trillions in assets. This success is protected by a strong brand, economies of scale, and its status as a common language for financial benchmarks, creating a nearly impenetrable moat against competitors. Despite recent criticism over its heavy concentration in a few tech giants, the index continues to fulfill its primary role: accurately reflecting the current state of the U.S. stock market.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest level in three years. For a new $350,000 mortgage, this rate drop translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of about $2,128, representing a monthly saving of around $210 compared to rates at the beginning of the year. The lower borrowing costs have sparked a surge in both new home loan applications and refinancing, offering significant potential savings for both prospective buyers and current homeowners.

          <p>The 2026 Georgia governor's race is taking shape with the entry of two prominent figures who resisted Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election: Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and former Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. Raffensperger, a Republican, famously refused Trump's demand to "find" votes. Duncan, who has since switched to the Democratic party, also repudiated the stolen election claims. Their candidacies highlight the enduring political fallout from the 2020 election crisis in Georgia, setting up a contest that will test the influence of the state's pro-Trump GOP base against candidates advocating for constitutional adherence.</p>
