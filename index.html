          <p>A beverage trend known as "heavy soda," featuring fountain drinks with an extra portion of syrup for enhanced sweetness, is gaining traction online, particularly in Southern Missouri. The trend, which aims to provide a stronger flavor that withstands melting ice, has sparked a mix of curiosity and disgust on social media platforms. Health experts, including dentists and orthodontists, are expressing concern over the high sugar content, warning of increased risks for cavities, gum disease, and other health issues linked to excessive sugar consumption.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have formally requested a meeting with President Trump. In their letter, they accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government funded beyond the September 30 deadline. Both parties appear positioned to blame the other for a potential shutdown after competing short-term spending bills failed to pass in Congress, escalating the political standoff.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has intensified its conflict with sanctuary states, issuing letters to California, New York, and Illinois demanding compliance with ICE detainer requests. The administration has threatened to involve the Department of Justice to sue these states and block future federal funding if they continue their policies of limited cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The states argue that honoring these detainers, which they consider requests rather than mandates, could violate state law and lead to liability for wrongful detention.</p>

          <p>Joanna Page, star of the popular British sitcom "Gavin and Stacey," has revealed in her new book that she was groped by a television host during filming. She stated that a female producer had warned her beforehand that the host could be "very handsy" and that she confronted him after the incident occurred. Page, who did not name the individual for legal reasons, described the experience as bizarre and reflective of what was once considered a normal part of the industry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intervened to stop U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights secured during the company's acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel, giving the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. The move underscores the administration's increasing influence in the private sector and its commitment to protecting American manufacturing jobs as outlined in the national-security agreement for the takeover.

          <p>Police in Sacramento have arrested a 64-year-old man suspected of firing multiple shots into the lobby window of the local ABC affiliate station, KXTV. The incident occurred a day after protesters had gathered at the station to demonstrate against ABC's suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. While a motive is still under investigation and it is unclear if the shooting was targeted, the building was occupied at the time, though fortunately, no one was injured in the event.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, elements of the Christian nationalist movement in the U.S. are framing him as a martyr for their cause. Analysts note that eulogies have heavily emphasized his faith, with some prominent figures casting his death as a catalyst for a "holy war" against perceived evil forces. This narrative aligns with the growth of Christian nationalism during the Trump era, which has seen a shift towards more aggressive, anti-democratic ideologies aimed at establishing Christian dominion over American society.</p>

          <p>According to Dr. Adam Friedman, a professor of dermatology, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while sitting indoors near a window. While glass may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, it does not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are associated with accelerated aging and skin cancer. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially for those who spend extended time near windows, to protect against this "silent" exposure.</p>
