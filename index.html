The White House Press Secretary defended the move, stating it was necessary for a modern and stable structure, based on advice from architects. The project, reportedly funded privately by the president and donors, has sparked public backlash and questions regarding the lack of public notification and the approval process for such a major alteration to the historic building.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for five-year home equity loans have fallen to an average of 8.11%, nearing their lowest point since 2023 and offering a more affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. Financial experts suggest that homeowners considering this option may not benefit from waiting for further rate cuts, as anticipated Federal Reserve actions are expected to have a minimal impact. By securing a loan now, borrowers can lock in a fixed, affordable rate and gain immediate access to funds, avoiding potential future rate increases. (not investment advice)</p>

The governor stated the initiative is necessary to hold agents accountable for what he described as unlawful attacks on minority communities, as he believes there is no oversight from federal leadership.

          <p>Eastside Brewing Co. in Ohio has received widespread online support after publicly defending its policy to prohibit children after 7 p.m., stating its taproom is an adult environment, not a playground. The brewery's management explained the decision was made in response to issues with unsupervised children, which led to complaints and threats from some patrons. Despite some negative reactions, the majority of online commenters praised the brewery for setting clear boundaries, with many pledging their future business and sparking a broader conversation about children in establishments that serve alcohol.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his intention to endorse former Governor Andrew Cuomo for the city's mayoral race, a surprising reversal after months of public tension between the two. Adams, who recently ended his own re-election campaign, stated he will campaign alongside Cuomo to engage Black and brown communities, despite having previously called him a "snake and a liar." This development comes as the race intensifies between Cuomo and democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, with both candidates having previously stated they would refuse an endorsement from Adams.</p>

          <h2>Search for New Head of UK Grooming Gang Inquiry Faces Months-Long Delay</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The process of appointing a new chair for the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs is expected to take months after two leading candidates withdrew from consideration. The inquiry has been beset by turmoil, with four members of its survivors' panel quitting and calling for the Safeguarding Minister's resignation, creating what one former candidate called a "highly charged and toxic environment." The government plans to re-engage with victims and survivors to restore trust and find a suitable leader for the investigation into the sexual exploitation of children.</p>

          <p>California will permit the hunting of mute swans year-round starting January 1, as part of a new legislative effort to manage the invasive, non-native species. State wildlife officials classify the birds as destructive, noting that their population has grown to nearly 7,000 and that they compete with native species for limited aquatic vegetation. Under the new law, which expires in 2031, licensed hunters can kill the swans at any time, and landowners can do so without a permit, treating them similarly to other invasive birds like the English sparrow.</p>

          <p>With a small number of mega-cap tech stocks now representing nearly 40% of the S&P 500, investors are increasingly seeking uncorrelated assets to mitigate portfolio concentration risk. According to market strategists, exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows show a clear trend towards cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies as investors look for alternative ways to hedge against volatility. While allocations to assets like gold and bitcoin remain relatively small for most, their adoption is becoming more mainstream as traditional diversification strategies face new challenges.

          <p>President Trump's pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge, has been sharply criticized by lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren as an act of "corruption." The pardon followed reports that a Trump family crypto venture was aided by a platform administered by Binance, raising questions about conflicts of interest. The White House defended the decision, portraying Zhao as a victim of the Biden administration's "war on crypto" and arguing that the requested three-year prison sentence was excessive.</p>

Duffy stated he does not want controllers working additional jobs and warned that staffing shortages could lead to more flight delays and cancellations as the department prioritizes safety over volume.</p>

          <p>A new scientific report has concluded that a record-setting marine heat wave in 2023 led to the "functional extinction" of staghorn and elkhorn corals along Florida's reef. These two "reef-building" species, which have provided the structural foundation for Caribbean reef ecosystems for thousands of years, experienced a mortality rate of nearly 100%. The extreme and prolonged heat stress was so severe that some corals died before they could even bleach, with their tissue simply melting away, marking a devastating and likely permanent loss for the marine environment.</p>

          <p>The recent functional extinction of Florida's staghorn and elkhorn corals, caused by a 2023 marine heat wave, poses a direct threat to coastal human life and property. These corals were crucial for protecting shorelines by growing in shallow waters and absorbing up to 97% of a wave's energy, acting as a natural seawall against storm surge and flooding. Their disappearance not only leaves coastal communities more vulnerable to hurricanes but also threatens Florida's multi-billion dollar fishing and tourism industries, which depend on the healthy reef ecosystem these species once supported.</p>
