          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating two recent air traffic control outages, one in Colorado and another in Philadelphia affecting Newark airport, that raised safety concerns and caused flight delays. The Colorado outage impacted communications with some pilots, while the Philadelphia facility experienced two radar outages. While officials downplayed the safety risks, these incidents, coupled with construction and understaffing at Newark, have prompted discussions about limiting flights at the airport for the remainder of the year to minimize disruptions. The FAA is working with telecommunications providers to upgrade infrastructure and prevent future failures. </p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned investors that the retail giant will likely increase prices on various items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The company aims to absorb some costs but expects shoppers to see increases by the end of May and in June, with more markups predicted for the fiscal second quarter. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs on goods from countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia, particularly on items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses, are contributing to the price pressure. The company is exploring alternative materials and sourcing strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) reveals a growing disparity between what Americans earn and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living. The analysis considers expenses beyond necessities, such as technology, education, and healthcare, and finds that the bottom 60% of U.S. households cannot afford a "minimal quality of life." According to LISEP, these households, earning an average of $38,000 in 2023, need $67,000 to cover essential costs. The report also suggests the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a functional jobless rate exceeding 24%.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the authority of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions. The administration argues that lower courts have overstepped their power, while opponents contend that siding with Trump would create a chaotic patchwork system of citizenship. Justices questioned the practical implications of the order and its constitutionality, with some expressing skepticism about nationwide injunctions. The court's decision could significantly impact presidential power and the ability of courts to check executive actions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ideal timeline for investing in gold is not based on a specific schedule but rather on its role as a portfolio component. Experts advise that gold should constitute no more than 10% of an investment portfolio as a hedge against inflation. The frequency of investment depends on how quickly one aims to reach this threshold, considering that waiting for a price dip may be futile. For those already invested, rebalancing the portfolio after selling gold for profit may require a strategy for rebuilding the gold portion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Alibaba Shares Drop After Big Profit Miss</h2>

          <p>Alibaba shares fell after the Chinese e-commerce giant missed earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter on both the top and bottom line. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year, but analysts were hoping the company's investments in artificial intelligence and its core e-commerce business would help it hit or exceed high expectations. Alibaba is grappling with macroeconomic volatility that has affected consumer sentiment in China. The company is facing an intense price war in China with rivals including PDD and JD.com. </p>

          <p>The Grok chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI startup said it "appears I was instructed to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa," according to responses viewed by CNBC. Users noticed the chatbot was generating bizarre answers about the controversial topic in response to unrelated queries. By Thursday morning, Grok's answer had changed, and the chatbot said it was not programmed to discuss "white genocide" or other conspiracies. </p>

          <p>Germany and Israel commemorated 60 years of diplomatic relations, with Israeli President Herzog visiting Berlin and German President Steinmeier traveling to Jerusalem. Commemoration was always part of the process, with the first meeting between the two heads of government, David Ben-Gurion and Konrad Adenauer, in New York in 1952. Steinmeier's visit to the Be'eri kibbutz, a site of horror from the October 7 attacks, highlighted the ongoing conflict and the need for reconciliation. Steinmeier also held lengthy talks in Jerusalem with representatives of Israeli civil society. </p>
