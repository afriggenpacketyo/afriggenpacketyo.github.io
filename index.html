          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has put forward a theory that the recent Blue Origin space flight, which featured an all-female crew including Jeff Bezos's fiancÃ©e Lauren Sanchez and singer Katy Perry, may not have actually occurred. O'Neal cited discrepancies within the video released by Blue Origin, including the lack of hair movement in zero gravity and an already open hatch upon landing. O'Neal believes Bezos would not risk sending Sanchez into actual space, suggesting the use of green screen technology to simulate the experience. Blue Origin has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA is not fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, despite the acting administrator's claims of being 80-85% ready. The review cites staffing limitations, hiring challenges, and a lack of coordination with states as key issues. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson stated the agency is working to finalize a plan focused on safeguarding Americans, empowering states, and coordinating federal assistance when necessary, emphasizing the president's vision for a streamlined FEMA. Morale within FEMA is reportedly low following discussions about potentially eliminating the agency.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who used his commencement speech to condemn the "genocide" in Gaza and accuse the U.S. of complicity.

NYU is currently pursuing disciplinary action against Rozos, citing a violation of university policies. The university is among several being investigated by the Trump administration for alleged antisemitism on campus since the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 600 employees, primarily journalists, at Voice of America (VOA), a federally funded news network providing independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. This action represents over a third of VOA's staff and signals a continuation of the administration's efforts to dismantle the broadcaster, despite a previous court ruling. In addition, the federal building housing VOA in Washington has been put up for sale. Trump has accused the outlet of spreading "anti-American" propaganda, and the administration intends to incorporate content from One America News Network into VOA's programming.</p>

The study examined fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations.

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism regarding President Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship through an executive order. The order aims to deny citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents, a move that contradicts the 14th Amendment. The court is also considering whether federal judges should be able to issue nationwide injunctions, which the Trump administration argues unfairly restricts the president's power. Several lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration that have led to dozens of nationwide injunctions blocking the implementation of his policies.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Decision to Lift Syria Sanctions Surprises Treasury Staff</h2>

          <p>President Trump's recent announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria surprised senior officials inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy. The announcement, made at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, lacked specifics, causing Treasury officials to scramble to understand the implications. The Syrian government has blamed sanctions for its inability to pay civil service salaries and rebuild war-ravaged infrastructure. Some work was underway at Treasury before the president's announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year due to a sharp decrease in exports. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations of a 0.1% fall. The decline in exports, which fell by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, was attributed to uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. The Bank of Japan had previously warned that the country's economy was likely to moderate due to the effects of trade policies worldwide, and the U.S. tariff policy will exert downward pressure on both economic activity and prices in Japan.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. diplomat Marco Rubio stated that he does not have high expectations for the Ukraine-Russia peace talks due to be held in Turkey, and that a meeting between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is necessary for progress to be made. Trump echoed this sentiment, suggesting that significant progress in peace talks was unlikely until he and Putin met in person. Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed Ukraine would send a delegation for the talks in Istanbul, but criticized the "low-level" delegation being sent by Moscow. Delegations from Turkey, the US, Ukraine and Russia had been due to meet in Istanbul on Thursday for the first face-to-face Ukraine-Russia talks since 2022.</p>

          <p>Official figures reveal a concerning rise in homelessness among disabled people in England, with over 60,000 disabled households facing homelessness last year, an increase of nearly 75% since 2019. Analysis by the charity Crisis also shows a decline in the amount of social housing allocated to disabled people. A government spokesperson stated that Â£1bn was being given to councils this year to "support families faster and stop people becoming homeless in the first place." The numbers are likely to add to unease in the Labour Party over planned cuts to disability benefits.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are experiencing financial instability due to President Trump's changing tariffs on Chinese goods. The fluctuating tariff rates, initially set at 145% and later reduced to 30%, have created challenges for businesses trying to plan for the future. Business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports small kitchen appliances from China, said he's just trying to stay afloat amidst tariff chaos. Many U.S. businesses are now facing a dilemma: They can either pay more to ship at the current 30% tariff rate on China, or wait in the hope that the Trump administration will lower the tariffs further.</p>

          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, has lost an appeal against a landmark defamation judgment which found he committed war crimes. A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging the Victoria Cross recipient had murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Mr Roberts-Smith had argued the judge made legal errors. The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces. A panel of three Federal Court judges on Friday upheld the original verdict. Mr Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence and has not been charged over any of the claims in a criminal court, where there is a higher burden of proof.</p>

A vote to pass or reject the bill is not likely to take place on Friday, but rather in June. Friday's debate comes as the government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on limiting the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a significant check on presidential authority. The cases involve President Trump's executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which has been deemed unconstitutional by lower courts. The justices appear ideologically divided, and the outcome is expected to depend on the decisions of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Brett M. Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. The Trump administration argues that nationwide injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its constitutional duties, while opponents argue they are necessary to stop unconstitutional actions.</p>
