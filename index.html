          <h2>Paul Tudor Jones Predicts New Stock Market Lows Despite Potential Tariff Reductions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones anticipates the stock market will decline to new lows even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China. Jones cites Trump's focus on tariffs and the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates as factors detrimental to the stock market. He suggests that any tariff reduction would still represent a significant tax increase, hindering economic growth. Jones, known for predicting the 1987 stock market crash, believes macroeconomic conditions are worsening, requiring substantial dovish action from the Fed to prevent further declines.

          <p>Israel's military launched airstrikes targeting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, disabling Sanaa's international airport and striking power plants. This action follows a Houthi missile strike on Israel's main airport near Tel Aviv, marking the first time a missile hit the airport grounds since October 2023. The Houthis have been targeting Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, raising their profile as part of Iran's "Axis of Resistance." The U.S. military has also intensified airstrikes against the Houthis since March, aiming to restore freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's next chancellor after a second vote in parliament, overcoming an initial defeat. The first vote saw Merz fall short of the required majority, an unprecedented event in post-war German history. Despite his coalition with the Social Democrats having enough seats, some members dissented. After negotiations, a second vote was held, where Merz secured the chancellorship. He will be sworn in by the president, and his cabinet will take office, averting a potential crisis for the coalition.</p>

          <p>The federal government has resumed collecting on defaulted student loans, ending a five-year pause that began during the Covid-19 pandemic. This decision impacts nearly 43 million Americans with federal student loan debt, with over one in five borrowers at risk of defaulting. The Trump administration has criticized student loan forgiveness policies, leading to limited access to loan forgiveness programs and changes to repayment options. Republicans on the House education committee are planning to overhaul the student loan system, replacing income-contingent repayment options with a new "Repayment Assistance Plan."</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Constitution and Supreme Court rulings reveals that all non-citizens on U.S. soil are entitled to "due process of law," though the specifics vary. The government must provide notice and a hearing in many cases, but not all. While migrants do not have extensive procedural protections from removal, the law requires steps to ensure fairness and the safety of vulnerable individuals. The type of "notice" and "hearing" depends on an immigrant's status and circumstances.</p>

          <p>Palantir's shares fell after the company reported earnings that met expectations and raised its full-year revenue guidance. The artificial intelligence software company saw growth in both its commercial and government sectors. CEO Alex Karp attributed the company's growth to increased adoption of its tools, particularly in the U.S. defense sector. Analysts, however, raised concerns about international growth and the company's high software multiple, contributing to the stock's decline.</p>
