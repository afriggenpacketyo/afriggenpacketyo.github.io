          <p>Governors Wes Moore of Maryland and Tim Walz of Minnesota addressed Democrats at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry in South Carolina, urging the party to adopt a more forceful approach. Both governors emphasized the importance of building coalitions and engaging with diverse constituencies, highlighting the urgency of the current political moment. While denying any immediate presidential aspirations for 2028, they stressed the need to focus on the challenges of 2025, advocating for the party to present a clear alternative to Trump's policies and actively compete in every district. The governors' remarks underscored a call for greater impatience and proactive engagement to win back lost American voters.</p>

          <p>A sperm donor in Europe, who was used to conceive at least 67 pregnancies, carried a rare cancer-causing mutation that has been linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 of the conceived children. The European Sperm Bank confirmed the presence of the TP53 genetic variant, which causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, increasing the risk of developing cancer. The variant was reportedly undetectable through standard screening methods at the time of donation in 2008, and the donor remains in good health. This case has prompted calls for a European limit on the number of births or families per donor, and the European Sperm Bank supports an internationally binding family limit.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes are offering a supportive environment for individuals with dementia and their caregivers, providing camaraderie and recreational activities. These cafes, numbering over 600 across the United States, offer a low-cost way for people with cognitive impairment and their families to socialize and cope with the challenges of memory loss. A recent report indicated that caregivers experience stress coordinating care, and memory cafes address social isolation for both patients and caregivers. The cafes distinguish themselves from other programs by including caregivers, offering mutual support through shared experiences and social interaction, potentially becoming more crucial given potential federal health funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of its privacy and integrity reviews, replacing human evaluators with AI systems for assessing risks associated with new features on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. This shift aims to expedite product development, but some current and former Meta employees worry about the potential for AI to make critical decisions regarding user privacy and platform safety. While Meta claims human expertise will still be used for complex issues, concerns remain that engineers, who are not privacy experts, will now have greater autonomy in judging risks. The changes come after Meta ended its fact-checking program and loosened its hate speech policies, reflecting a new emphasis on unrestrained speech and rapid updates.</p>

          <p>Veteran lawyers are raising concerns about the validity of agreements between President Trump and several major law firms, suggesting they may not be legally sound. These deals involve the firms committing to provide pro bono services in exchange for curtailing investigations into their hiring practices and maintaining access to federal buildings. Critics argue that these agreements are made under coercion, as the firms are essentially pressured into compliance through executive orders, some of which have been deemed unconstitutional. Concerns also exist regarding potential conflicts of interest and violations of federal bribery statutes, as the firms' actions could be seen as promising something of value in exchange for favorable treatment from a public official.</p>

What started as a pandemic-era binge-watching hobby has evolved into a highly anticipated annual event, involving friends from across the country who travel to different locations for a three-day weekend of competition. The games are meticulously planned by two designated 'Jeffs' each year, who spend months devising challenges and twists, while other friends serve as producers, recording content for their Instagram fanbase. This past Memorial Day weekend, the fourth annual games were held in Collegeville, PA, with participants strategizing, blindsiding, and voting each other off for the chance to win bragging rights.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal that North Korea has deployed what appear to be balloons alongside its damaged 5,000-ton warship, which has been partially submerged since a failed launch. Experts suggest the balloons could be used to help right the ship or to shield it from drone surveillance. The destroyer, intended to showcase North Korea's naval modernization efforts, suffered damage when its stern prematurely slid into the water during a launch event. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the upcoming Workers' Party plenary session.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's initiative to sell stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice becoming available in stores, attracting eager consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to offer the rice at a reduced price of 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. The rice, sourced from 2021 and 2022 stockpiles, is part of an effort to alleviate the burden of rising rice prices on households. Ito-Yokado secured 5,000 tons, and Iris Ohyama secured 10,000 tons of the 2022 harvest.</p>
