          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 17:10:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the UN's cultural and educational agency, with the move taking effect at the end of 2026. The State Department cited the agency's promotion of "divisive social and cultural causes" and a "globalist, ideological agenda" as primary reasons for the departure. This action reverses the Biden administration's 2023 decision to rejoin and also stems from long-standing objections to UNESCO's 2011 admission of Palestine as a member state, which the administration views as contributing to anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76, his family announced. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's distinctive vocals and on-stage antics defined a genre, while a later career in reality television on "The Osbournes" introduced him to a new generation. He had been battling Parkinson's disease, which he was diagnosed with in 2019, alongside other health issues that ultimately led him to retire from touring. His death comes just weeks after performing a final farewell show in his hometown of Birmingham, England.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah reportedly posted and then quickly deleted a fake letter on social media announcing the resignation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The letter, which appeared to be AI-generated with a distorted Fed seal and unusual formatting, was shared with the caption "Powell's out!" before being removed. Lee later stated he deleted the post "out of an abundance of caution" as he was unsure of its legitimacy. The incident occurs as President Trump has been openly critical of Powell and has urged him to resign over the central bank's interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is set to appoint Gita O’Neill, a career city attorney, as its new interim chief executive. O'Neill will lead the agency for a 12-month term as it undergoes significant downsizing, with its budget being reduced by about 40% due to the creation of a new county homelessness department. The leadership change comes as LAHSA faces scrutiny over its financial management and contracting practices following critical audits. O'Neill's appointment is scheduled for a vote just as the current CEO, Va Lecia Adams Kellum, departs from the role.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, named the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), has been established under a bill recently signed into law by President Trump. This income-driven repayment option, set to be available by July 2026, will calculate payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% with a $10 minimum. The plan offers forgiveness after 30 years, longer than existing plans which are being phased out for new borrowers. While it includes benefits like a monthly credit for dependents, it differs from previous plans by not shielding a portion of income from the payment calculation. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision is considered a rare move, as judges typically allow interim prosecutors to remain in their roles pending Senate confirmation.

          <p>A recent analysis suggests President Donald Trump's social media behavior has become increasingly erratic, particularly amid public scrutiny of his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Over a recent weekend, Trump posted dozens of times on Truth Social, sharing bizarre, contextless videos and AI-generated images of political rivals being arrested. The article posits that this spree, resembling low-quality "soft-brain scrolling" content, could be a defensive coping mechanism, a sign of feeling powerless, or an indication of a president increasingly detached from reality. This behavior marks a shift from his previous, more directive social media use.</p>

AFP's global news director stated that their local reporters are physically weakened by the struggle to find food, suffering from constant headaches and dizziness that impair their ability to work. The situation has grown so dire that AFP's journalists' union warned it cannot remember a time when colleagues faced the risk of dying from hunger. This plea underscores the dangerous conditions for media operating within the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. According to the White House, the deals will see the Philippines and Indonesia become "Open Market" to American goods, with Indonesia agreeing to eliminate tariffs on 99% of its trade with the U.S. The announcement with the Philippines followed a White House meeting with its president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. These agreements are part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reshape global trade relationships ahead of an August 1 deadline for countries to reach deals.</p>

          <p>House Republican leadership announced an early start to the annual five-week summer recess, a move Democrats claim is intended to avoid politically difficult votes related to the Jeffrey Epstein files. Democrats on the House Rules Committee have repeatedly tried to force votes compelling the release of documents from the Epstein investigation, putting pressure on their Republican colleagues. Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed the efforts as "political games," insisting the administration is already handling the matter. The decision to cut the workweek short effectively paralyzes the House floor and delays any potential legislative action on the issue until September.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team secured a 2-1 series victory over England by winning the decisive third one-day international by 13 runs. Chasing a record 319 for victory, England's effort was anchored by captain Nat Sciver-Brunt's 98, but the team ultimately fell short, being bowled out for 305. India's formidable total was built on a century by captain Harmanpreet Kaur and supported by a strong bowling performance from 21-year-old Kranti Goud, who took six wickets. The result gives India victories in both the T20 and ODI series, leaving England with significant questions ahead of the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that an extension of the current trade tariff suspension with China is likely to be negotiated during upcoming talks in Stockholm. The current 90-day truce, which halted most of the heavy tariffs each country had imposed on the other, is set to expire on August 12. Bessent stated that he believes trade relations with China are in a "very good place" and that the talks will formalize an extension. The discussions are also expected to cover other topics, including China's manufacturing output and its purchases of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil, signaling a potentially more constructive phase in U.S.-China relations.

          <p>U.S. automakers are reportedly absorbing the costs of new tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers, leading to significant impacts on their profitability. General Motors revealed that tariffs cost the company $1.1 billion in the last quarter, reducing its profit margin, while Stellantis reported a tariff impact of $387 million. Industry data suggests this is a widespread trend, as car manufacturers are hesitant to raise already high vehicle prices for fear of deterring buyers. This strategy of taking a direct hit to profits highlights the financial strain that current trade policies are placing on the automotive industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to rescind a ban on the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chip to China has drawn sharp criticism from China hawks in Washington. The reversal was part of a broader trade deal negotiated in June, where the U.S. eased some export controls in exchange for access to Chinese rare earth minerals. Critics are concerned that providing China with advanced technology, even if it is not top-of-the-line, undermines national security. Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, have defended the move, arguing it keeps Chinese developers dependent on the American technology ecosystem while withholding the most powerful U.S. chips.</p>
