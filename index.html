          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence will allocate over £1 billion to advance battlefield technology, including a new Digital Targeting Web that connects soldiers with satellite, aircraft, and drone data for faster threat targeting. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized that this investment, made possible by increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, reflects lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, where AI and software are used to identify and engage Russian targets. A new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command will also oversee military cyber operations and electronic warfare, responding to rising cyber-attacks, with over 90,000 attacks faced by the UK military in the past two years. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte urges allies to increase defence spending beyond 3.5% of GDP.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for leading a criminal enterprise while incarcerated, in addition to a 200-year state sentence for a 1973 murder. Despite the commutation, Hoover still faces the remainder of his state sentence in Illinois, with prosecutors expressing disappointment, emphasizing Hoover's history of running a large-scale drug operation from prison. Hoover's attorneys celebrated the commutation, highlighting his rehabilitation efforts and the advocacy that led to his release from federal custody.</p>

Both representatives acknowledged reservations about certain aspects of the bill, with Flood admitting unawareness of a provision that could hinder judges' ability to hold parties in contempt of court.

          <p>The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) has implemented additional rule changes for the upcoming girls' track and field state championship due to the controversy surrounding a trans athlete, AB Hernandez, competing in girls' events. The CIF will now expand the pool of competitors and medal recipients to accommodate biological female athletes displaced by a biological male competitor in long jump, high jump, and triple jump events. This decision follows increasing pressure from residents and the Trump administration, with the Department of Justice launching an investigation into the CIF and California Attorney General Rob Bonta over the state's law allowing trans athletes to compete with girls. While some families believe the changes are insufficient, the CIF maintains it is committed to protecting the rights and safety of all students.</p>

This move is in response to China's recent restrictions on exports of critical minerals to the United States, which threatened to disrupt U.S. company supply chains. The Commerce Department has reportedly suspended licenses allowing American companies to sell products and technology to COMAC, a Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer, impacting the development of its C919 aircraft.

One of the female suspects allegedly used a stolen French bulldog as part of the group's cover, walking the dog to blend in with the neighborhood while acting as a lookout.

          <p>Canada's decision to cull 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm due to the avian flu has sparked controversy, with figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Oz advocating for further testing instead. Kennedy urged Canadian authorities to study the ostriches for scientific knowledge, while Oz offered to relocate the birds to his Florida ranch. Despite these efforts, most veterinarians argue that keeping potentially infected birds alive poses a public health risk, especially considering the ongoing avian flu outbreak in the United States. The farm owners, who have lost a legal battle to save the birds, argue that the animals should be kept alive to test their antibodies.</p>

          <p>Massive wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, with crews also battling fires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Firefighters have made progress, and all Minnesota evacuations were lifted on Memorial Day, but the fires now cover approximately 30,000 acres. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was human-caused, while the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources leads the fight against the Jenkins Creek and Munger Shaw fires. Interactive maps updated by the National Interagency Fire Center provide details on the affected areas, and donations are being collected to support relief efforts for affected communities.</p>

          <p>Two men have been sentenced for their roles in the deaths of an Indian family who froze to death while attempting to cross into the US from Canada. Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel and Steve Anthony Shand were convicted of human trafficking, criminal conspiracy, and culpable homicide. The Patel family, including two children, died during a blizzard in January 2022, while trying to cross the border. Patel, described as a human trafficker, oversaw the operation, while Shand was meant to pick up the migrants after they crossed.  The smugglers prioritized profit over the lives of the family.</p>

          <p>There are growing concerns that President Trump's depletion of the federal workforce is putting America's farms at risk, which could lead to higher food prices and hurdles for farm exports. The reduction in personnel at agencies responsible for animal and plant protection raises questions about the ability to maintain food safety and support agricultural trade. The impact of these workforce reductions could affect both domestic food availability and the competitiveness of American farm products in international markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the emergence of the "TACO" trade, an acronym for "Trump Always Chickens Out," which describes the market's reaction to his tariff announcements and subsequent easing of those tariffs. Trump dismissed the term as a "nasty question" and asserted that his tariff strategy is a form of negotiation, not a sign of backing down. He argued that his actions have led to increased dialogue and negotiations with trade partners, such as the European Union. However, analysts caution against complacency, citing concerns about potential inflation and the U.S.'s fiscal outlook.</p>

          <p>President Trump's impatience, characterized by a short attention span and a desire for quick policy changes, is becoming a defining aspect of his administration. This impatience has led to strained relationships with foreign leaders, legal challenges, and inconsistent trade policies. While some advisors attempted to moderate these impulses during his first term, the current lack of experienced advisors has amplified Trump's tendency to act impulsively, often undermining his own objectives. Examples include his approach to the war in Ukraine, immigration enforcement, and trade negotiations with the European Union.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered ICE to release Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist employed by Harvard University, stating there was no factual or legal basis for revoking her visa. Petrova was detained after failing to declare scientific samples she carried into the country, leading to smuggling charges and deportation proceedings. The judge cited concerns for Petrova's safety if deported to Russia and questioned the propriety of the customs officer's actions. Despite the ruling, Petrova faces additional smuggling charges in Massachusetts, raising the possibility of continued detention.</p>
