          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A Los Angeles court has ruled that the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing can proceed, despite opposition from the district attorney. Lyle and Erik Menendez were convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and are currently serving life in prison without parole. Their attorneys are seeking a reduced sentence under a California law that allows inmates who were under 26 at the time of their crimes to seek resentencing, arguing their brains were still developing. The district attorney's office maintains the brothers have not fully taken responsibility for their actions, but the judge emphasized the importance of consistency despite changes in leadership.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, over his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, has not been charged with a crime but is being deported under a Cold War-era law deeming his presence adverse to American foreign policy interests. The ACLU criticized the decision as "pre-written," citing the lack of evidence presented against Khalil besides a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Khalil's legal team plans to appeal the order, arguing that it violates his right to free speech and due process.</p>

            <p>South Carolina executed Mikal Mahdi by firing squad, the second such execution in the state in five weeks. Mahdi was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer in 2004.

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, which faces potential closure. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, employs 2,700 people and is the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The company cites challenging market conditions and high costs for its losses. The government is weighing options to protect the site, including emergency legislation to assume control of operations and ensure employees are reinstated if sacked.

However, they caution that a decision to act on Taiwan remains a complex political and military one for Beijing. The United States has imposed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, potentially emboldening Beijing if they weather the economic challenges successfully. (not investment advice)</p>
