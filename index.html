          <p>A leading economist from China International Capital Corporation has asserted that China possesses a significant advantage in the global stablecoin race due to its mature third-party payment systems like WeChat Pay and Alipay. These platforms, which function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency, are supported by a well-established regulatory framework. The economist's analysis highlights that these digital money systems are safeguarded by central bank base money, positioning China to lead as stablecoins become more prominent in international economic discussions.

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed new international restrictions on the trade of all eel species, a move strongly opposed by Japan. Submitted under the Washington Convention, the proposal would mandate that countries provide proof of legal capture and obtain an export permit for Japanese eels and other species. If adopted, these regulations would take effect in June 2027, significantly impacting the global eel market and creating new compliance challenges for exporting nations like Japan, which is a major consumer and importer of eels.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that Harbaugh and other university officials knew about Weiss's suspicious computer activity in December 2022 but allowed him to coach in a national playoff game before he was fired. The plaintiffs argue this delay demonstrates that student welfare was not prioritized over the high-stakes game.</p>

          <p>Japan's women's national football team, Nadeshiko Japan, suffered a 3-1 defeat against Spain in an international friendly, marking their third consecutive loss in a month. Despite taking an early lead with a goal from Mina Tanaka, Japan was unable to hold off the second-ranked Spanish side. Spain equalized just before halftime and scored two more goals in the second half to secure a dominant victory. The loss represents a setback for the team after a promising start under their new manager earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Canadian business owners are expressing frustration over the economic uncertainty created by the ongoing tariff war with the United States, their largest trading partner.

Despite ongoing negotiations, a recent termination of trade discussions by Trump over Canada's digital services tax has heightened anxiety.

          <p>A new Tulane University study has found that sections of the concrete flood walls built to protect New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina are sinking, some at a rate of nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is occurring faster than sea-level rise, potentially degrading the city's flood protection system and increasing risk in a city largely below sea level. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and residential areas, underscoring the urgent need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>New data from Europe shows a significant downturn for Tesla, with the company's sales plummeting by 27.9% in May compared to the previous year. This decline is particularly notable as the overall market for fully-electric vehicles in the region grew by 27.2% during the same period. Analysts attribute Tesla's sustained slump to a combination of factors, including controversial actions by CEO Elon Musk and increasingly robust competition from other automakers, particularly more affordable and innovative Chinese EV brands that are gaining market share.
