          <p>New York's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services, the parent company of the Zelle payment network, alleging its failure to implement adequate safeguards led to over $1 billion in consumer losses to fraud. The suit claims that known design flaws, such as a quick registration process and lack of verification, made the platform a prime target for scammers. EWS, which is co-owned by several major U.S. banks, has dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt," noting a similar federal case was previously dismissed.</p>

          <p>Economists widely expect the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut at its next meeting, influenced by a recent lower-than-expected inflation report and a slowing labor market. This potential policy shift comes amid sustained pressure from the Trump administration to lower borrowing costs to stimulate the economy. While the Fed has held rates steady for months due to concerns about tariff-induced inflation, current market sentiment strongly predicts a quarter-point reduction to prevent a potential economic downturn.

          <p>A new analysis has identified the vehicles with the worst five-year resale value, with the BMW i3 leading the list with a nearly 58% depreciation. The report highlights that several electric vehicles, including models from Nissan, Volvo, and Porsche, are among those losing value most rapidly. The findings suggest that initial popularity and advanced technology do not guarantee long-term value retention in the used car market, where reliability and practicality are often more prized.</p>

While the amoeba is common in warm freshwater, infections are extremely rare and occur when contaminated water enters the brain through the nose, leading to a condition called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.</p>

The consensus suggests that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, consumers will bear a greater share of the costs, potentially pushing core inflation higher.

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing record flooding from the Mendenhall Glacier after a glacial basin released a massive "outburst flood." The Mendenhall River reached an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing previous records and forcing some residents to evacuate. This annual event, caused by a retreating glacier due to climate change, has intensified in recent years, leading authorities to install temporary barriers to protect hundreds of homes from the rushing water.</p>
