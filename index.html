          <h2>Red Bull Expansion in Germany Sparks Water Scarcity Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Red Bull's expansion plans near Berlin are facing criticism due to concerns about water scarcity in the drought-ridden Brandenburg region. The company's increased groundwater extraction has raised questions about environmental sustainability and transparency. While the local mayor assures that water levels are closely monitored, environmentalists express concern about the potential for over-extraction and contamination, given the region's vulnerability to climate change and the unsustainable practice of exporting water-intensive products to water-rich areas. A legal challenge has been launched to investigate subsidies and water costs related to Red Bull's operations.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 index has achieved a record-breaking fifteen-day winning streak, gaining over 5% since the start of the year, even as global markets face turbulence due to U.S. tariff policies. The UK's neutral trade status and robust corporate results, particularly from defensive sectors like healthcare and energy, have attracted investors seeking refuge from volatility. While technical indicators suggest a potential pullback, analysts anticipate further gains, potentially reaching 8,900 points by the end of next month, driven by expectations of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. However, geopolitical risks and a stronger pound could pose challenges to continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this article, Jonathan Eig reflects on the relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail" in today's political climate, where cruelty and injustice prevail. Eig argues that King's message of love and nonviolent action provides a roadmap for those who disapprove of current tactics and wish to fight back. King believed in the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems, advocating for confrontation while maintaining faith in the goodness of others. The article emphasizes the importance of individual action and the renewal of the democratic contract in the face of division and resentment.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are weighing President Trump's campaign promises, including tax cuts on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, in their upcoming tax bill. While some Republicans express reservations about the lack of guiding principles beyond fulfilling campaign pledges, others acknowledge the political necessity of incorporating these ideas. The primary concern revolves around the potential cost of these proposals and their impact on the national deficit. Lawmakers are exploring ways to limit the scope of the tax breaks and offset the costs through spending cuts, particularly in Medicaid and other programs for low-income Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to slash public funding for NPR and PBS, alleging bias in their reporting. The order instructs federal agencies to cease funding and root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. NPR and PBS, which receive significant public funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, have prepared for potential cuts since Trump's election. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has sued Mr. Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.</p>

Trump's threat follows Harvard's refusal to comply with administration demands related to antisemitism and DEI on campus.

          <h2>Expiration of Tariff Loophole Set to Impact Online Shoppers</h2>

          <p>The expiration of a tariff loophole allowing duty-free entry for low-value packages is set to increase prices for U.S. consumers, particularly on goods from China. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu relied on this loophole, known as the de minimis rule, to undercut U.S.-based sellers. The change is expected to impact retailers, consumers, and trade between the U.S. and China, potentially leading to delays, higher prices, and a diminished market. While some U.S. manufacturers may benefit, consumers are likely to see reduced variety and increased costs.</p>

Uncapped seamer Sam Cook is included in the squad due to injuries to other bowlers. Captain Ben Stokes is expected to play a full role as an all-rounder after recovering from hamstring surgery.

          <p>President Trump has again threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming, "It's what they deserve!" This marks the latest development in the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard, with Trump previously suggesting the revocation due to the university's alleged failure to protect Jewish students. The administration has already frozen federal funding, and Harvard's president has rejected the administration's demands, citing illegal attempts to dictate university policies. The president does not have the power to revoke an organization's tax status, but he can ask the Internal Revenue Service to do it.</p>

NIOSH is expected to lose upwards of 900 employees due to mass firings carried out by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The cuts have halted key functions, including cancer tracking, respirator approval, and health hazard evaluations.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially eliminated a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods from China without paying tariffs. This move aims to help U.S. manufacturers but is expected to raise prices for online shoppers. The de minimis rule, which allowed products up to $800 to avoid tariffs, has led to a surge in individually addressed packages from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The decision is partly driven by concerns about fentanyl entering the U.S. and the impact on U.S. jobs in warehousing and logistics.</p>

          <p>Mumbai, known as India's most liberal city and entertainment hub, faces increasing restrictions on free speech. Comedians and filmmakers have been targeted for political satire and content deemed unfavorable to certain groups.

A lawyer in Mumbai has started a firm to protect creators, noting that any creator making content about political or religious themes puts themselves at greater legal risk.

Retailers are concerned about inventory levels and may pull back on promotions for July Fourth, Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a significant victory in a parliamentary special election, seizing a seat from the Labour Party by a narrow margin. The result signals the rising influence of Mr. Farage and his anti-immigration platform. The party also made gains in mayoral and local council elections, potentially reshaping British politics. Labour won three mayoral elections but Reform performed strongly, coming second in all three. This comes as anti-incumbent fervor and tensions over immigration fueled support for Reform among voters with Labour roots.</p>
