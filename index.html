          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel that advises the CDC on vaccine recommendations. Kennedy stated that a "clean sweep" is necessary to restore public trust in vaccine science, claiming the panel had become a rubber stamp for any vaccine. This move has been criticized by medical groups, who see it as undermining a transparent process that has saved lives and as an attempt to stoke distrust in vaccines. Kennedy has previously taken actions that reflect vaccine skepticism since taking his position at HHS. The action has been met with criticism from the American Public Health Association, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American College of Physicians.

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in Los Angeles to support National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement. The Marines, joining around 2,100 National Guard members, are tasked with protecting federal personnel and property, having received training in de-escalation and crowd control. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned the deployment as an illegal abuse of power and has indicated his intention to sue the Trump administration to halt the action.

          <p>The article argues that President Trump's decision to federalize the California National Guard without Governor Newsom's request is unprecedented and unwise. Historically, National Guard deployments in response to civil unrest have occurred when local law enforcement is overwhelmed, with the governor's consent. Trump's action, driven by immigration enforcement policies and a personal conflict with Newsom, is seen as a political power play. The author contends that deploying the military as a hostile force is a recipe for trouble and that the National Guard is best utilized under state jurisdiction to support local first responders.
