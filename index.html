          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from a Texas detention center after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. US authorities accused him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist", but the judge refuted the government's claims. The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Mr Suri in separate proceedings. Several students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for "violence and terrorism".</p>

          <p>China-Philippine relations face a period of uncertainty after President Marcos failed to diminish the influence of the Duterte camp in recent elections. Observers suggest that Sara Duterte, now likely to survive an impeachment trial, could be a formidable candidate in the 2028 presidential election. Her "pragmatic" stance on China may lead to improved relations between the two countries if she succeeds in the race. Preliminary results indicate that Marcos' allies secured fewer Senate seats than expected, while Duterte's allies are poised to claim enough seats to shield her from conviction.</p>

This has led to policies like halting foreign aid to South Africa and prioritizing Afrikaner refugees for resettlement in the U.S. President Trump's views, influenced by figures like golfer Gary Player and media personalities, have shaped this approach, emphasizing a narrative of white victimhood and alleged persecution of Afrikaners.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration offers refugee status to Afrikaners claiming persecution in South Africa, opinions within the Afrikaner community are divided. Some, like social media influencer Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, express pride in their South African identity and wish to contribute to the nation's story. Others, like Ilse Steenkamp, feel forced to leave due to crime and land issues, seeing refugee status as justified. The South African government dismisses claims of persecution, attributing the emigration to unwillingness to embrace societal changes.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. The decision was praised by their attorney, Mark Geragos, who sees it as a step toward their freedom. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who opposed the resentencing, acknowledged the decision's significant implications.
