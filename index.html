          <p>Residents of Starbase, Texas, the town associated with Elon Musk's SpaceX, have been notified that they may face restrictions on their property use due to a proposed new zoning ordinance and city-wide map. The proposed "Mixed Use District" would allow for residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses. A public hearing is scheduled for June 23, 2025, to discuss the zoning changes, which come after Starbase officially formed as a municipal corporation run by SpaceX employees. The town's population is around 500, with a significant portion employed by SpaceX, and the company's launch facility is located within its 1.6 square-mile area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he exceeded his legal authority. The ruling voided the baseline tariff on most countries and levies imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada, but does not impact tariffs on specific sectors like steel and aluminum. However, a federal appeals court temporarily suspended the trade court's decision, reinstating the tariffs for now. The Court of International Trade resolves disputes related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade, consisting of nine judges appointed for life. The judges ruled unanimously that the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 were unlawful.</p>

The document, to be submitted to BRICS heads of state in July, signals a shift towards proactive coordination in international negotiations ahead of COP30 in Brazil.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are declining again, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money right now. The average rate has dropped to 8.14%, but borrowers should be aware that rates could rise or fall unexpectedly due to the variable nature of HELOCs. It's important to calculate long-term affordability closely, considering potential rate changes, and homeowners could refinance into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate in the future. Those contemplating a HELOC should weigh these factors to make an informed decision and position themselves for borrowing success. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration aims to reduce alleged political indoctrination on campuses and ensure American students receive a high-quality education.

          <p>The resumption of student loan payments is negatively impacting many borrowers' credit scores, with millions experiencing drops of over 100 points. The end of the "on ramp" period, which previously shielded borrowers from credit reporting for missed payments, has led to newly delinquent loans being reported to credit bureaus. This decline in credit scores could lead to reduced credit limits, higher interest rates, and limited access to credit for affected borrowers.

          <p>The Trump administration has set a goal to arrest 3,000 people a day in its anti-immigration agenda, tripling arrest figures from earlier this year. This directive, delivered by Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem, involves federal law enforcement agents assisting in arrests and transports, and arresting people at previously protected locations like courthouses. Critics argue this aggressive approach undermines local economies and leads to citizens being caught in the dragnet. There are concerns that non-immigration-related investigations are being neglected as a result of the increased focus on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Israel announced plans to establish 22 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including legalizing existing outposts, sparking condemnation from Jordan and Britain. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that the decision strengthens Israel's hold on the region and prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state. Peace Now, an anti-settlement group, called the move the most extensive of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords. The international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while Palestinians seek the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and east Jerusalem for their future state.</p>
