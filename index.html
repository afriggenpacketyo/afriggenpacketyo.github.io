          <p>A growing number of tech workers in China are expressing concerns about age discrimination, particularly the 'curse of 35,' where employees over that age are at risk of layoffs. This trend has gained traction on social media and is reflected in online job listings, including civil service positions, that explicitly state age limits of 35 or younger. The phenomenon highlights a tightening job market and the perception that older workers are less valuable in the rapidly evolving tech industry. The reasons behind this perception and the sectors most affected remain a topic of discussion.</p>

          <p>As Democrats seek to regain political ground, some in California are suggesting mandatory retirement ages for elected officials. The debate, spurred by concerns over leaders remaining in power past their prime, has been initiated by San Francisco Democrats. The resolution, to be considered by the statewide party, acknowledges the contributions of experienced leaders like Dianne Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, but also raises concerns about age-related decline and its impact on decision-making. Eric Kingsbury, a San Francisco Democrat, cited President Biden's age as a catalyst for the proposal, aiming to encourage younger candidates and ensure effective leadership. The proposal faces opposition, with some arguing it's ageist and discriminatory, while others point to the need for fresh perspectives in politics.</p>

While drivers can opt out of accepting cash, the move aligns Uber's operations with many other countries and reflects a growing recognition of the importance of cash payments. The Treasury Committee of MPs has highlighted the need to protect cash access for vulnerable groups, prompting debate about potential regulations to ensure businesses accept cash.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the reinstatement of over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) employees, reversing an earlier ruling that had temporarily stayed Donald Trump's executive order to dismantle the US taxpayer-funded news service. The court's decision defers to the executive branch on employment matters, effectively preventing the broadcasters from returning to work until the case is resolved. Judge Nina Pillard dissented, arguing the decision silences Voice of America for the foreseeable future. This ruling impacts the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees VoA and other broadcasters, and highlights ongoing concerns about the independence of government-funded media outlets.</p>

          <p>As Europe commemorates VE Day, there is growing anxiety over the state of transatlantic relations, particularly in light of President Trump's policies and rhetoric. While VE Day celebrates the Allied victory over Nazi Germany, Trump's actions have shaken the foundation of shared values and security visions. His apparent respect for Putin, coupled with threats to traditionally close allies, has sparked concern among Europeans. The war in Ukraine has further amplified these fears, with many viewing Trump's stance as a threat to peace and security in Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reform party's success in recent local council elections indicates a significant shift beyond mere protest voting, according to Sir John Curtice. The party's strong performance, securing the most votes and seats, is particularly evident in areas that heavily favored Brexit and Boris Johnson in 2019. The analysis suggests that Reform's appeal is concentrated among those who believe in the Brexit decision, particularly in working-class areas with fewer university graduates. This presents a challenge for both Conservative and Labour parties, who need to better connect with this segment of the electorate to recover from recent losses.</p>
