Trump's administration initially blocked the deal, leading companies to reconsider major investments in the U.S. Nippon Steel ultimately finalized the acquisition after agreeing to invest $11 billion and grant the U.S. government veto power over key management decisions.

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against proposed cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft stated that while she understands the need to address the welfare bill, she believes cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit are not the right approach. The government claims it is fixing a broken welfare system to support those who can and want to work while protecting the most vulnerable. The proposed bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The ruling allows the continued deployment of approximately 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles. Trump invoked Title 10 to federalize the Guard in response to demonstrations against immigration raids, but Newsom sued, objecting to the troop deployment. The court found that the president likely exercised his statutory authority lawfully, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents.</p>

          <p>Niger's ruling junta has announced plans to nationalize Somair, a unit of the French uranium company Orano, escalating tensions between the two nations. The junta cited "irresponsible, illegal and disloyal behavior" by Orano, which is 90% owned by the French state. This decision follows a deterioration in relations after the 2023 military coup in Niger. Orano has operated uranium mines in Niger for decades but has been shut out of key operations following the coup.</p>
