            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, emphasizing the importance of due process. Van Hollen argues that the Trump administration wrongfully detained and deported Abrego Garcia, violating his constitutional rights. He warned that denying due process to one individual threatens the rights of all Americans, stating that the administration is "flouting the courts". Van Hollen's visit and media appearances highlight the senator's concern over the rule of law and constitutional rights in immigration cases.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in Alaska LNG, a massive natural gas project, to navigate Trump's tariffs and secure trade deals. The project, estimated at over $40 billion, includes an 800-mile pipeline and liquefaction plant. With Trump's support, Alaska LNG aims to export 20 million metric tons of LNG annually, potentially reshaping U.S. energy dominance and trade relations. However, political and commercial risks remain, including potential Democratic opposition and competition from Gulf Coast LNG options, raising questions about the project's long-term viability.

DeStefano was influenced by his high school teacher Frank McCourt, and feels he found a way to heal people not with surgery but through writing.

            <p>A leaked draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes a sweeping overhaul of the State Department, including significant cuts to sub-Saharan operations, climate envoys, and bureaus focused on human rights and gender equality. The plan involves reorganizing the department into four regional bureaus and closing numerous embassies and consulates in Africa. It would also eliminate the Bureau of International Organizations and significantly downsize the U.S. embassy in Canada, shifting diplomatic staff assignments to regional focuses. While Secretary Rubio has dismissed the report as "fake news", the order reflects a potential shift away from multilateralism and towards prioritizing the president's foreign policy vision.</p>

While analysts like Dan Ives predict a short-term surge in used device sales, they also anticipate consumers returning to new tech purchases once financially feasible.

Marks suggests monitoring actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital, and labor, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies. By tracking these key components, one can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's health than by relying on superficial metrics. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Emma Beddington reflects on a seemingly innocuous lie she told on a first date 30 years ago, claiming to drive a Land Rover, and questions the pervasive dishonesty in modern dating. Inspired by a reality TV show centered on lie detection, she considers whether all dating lies are inherently awful. While acknowledging egregious lies about relationships or intentions are harmful, she suggests that lesser lies, born of insecurity or politeness, might deserve a compassionate blind eye. Beddington muses on how her own small fib, eventually revealed, had no negative impact on her relationship.</p>

            <p>This opinion piece suggests that China should require bilateral trade with the US to be settled in renminbi as a countermeasure to US tariffs. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate, challenging the dominance of the US dollar. By forcing the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, the renminbi's use and demand would increase, potentially encouraging global investors to increase their holdings of renminbi assets. This strategic approach aims to shift the balance of power in the trade war and signal China's economic strength.</p>

            <p>Amy Woolard's poem '1994' explores themes of connection, memory, and the passage of time through vivid imagery and evocative language. The poem uses alcohol as a metaphor for mixing and altering experiences, reflecting on the shared scars and local conspiracies that bind people together. It contemplates the transient nature of fame and the human tendency to believe the music of their generation is unique. Ultimately, the poem captures a sense of nostalgia and the transformative power of light and shadow.</p>
