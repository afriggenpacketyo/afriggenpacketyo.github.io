          <p>During Liverpool FC's victory parade, a car drove into a crowd, injuring dozens including a couple from Shropshire and their baby. Daniel Evason and his family were struck by the vehicle, with his partner being dragged under the wheels and their baby's pram thrown several feet. Twenty-seven people were hospitalized, and twenty others were treated at the scene; police have arrested a 53-year-old man, and the incident is not being treated as terror-related. Evason described the event as turning the best day into the worst day of his life, expressing fears about attending future parades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are utilizing a decades-old customs law called the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price between a foreign manufacturer and a vendor, rather than the inflated price from the vendor to the U.S. retailer. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under the Trump administration's tariff regime, with companies exploring its potential cost savings. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales, carried out at arm's length by independent parties, and proof that the item was destined for the U.S., with documentation of the first sale price.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced plans to support more generous tax breaks for married people and abolish the two-child benefit limit to make it easier for people to have children. Farage emphasized that lifting the cap is intended to support lower-paid workers, not to promote a benefits culture. He also pledged to reverse government cuts that withdrew winter fuel payments from 10 million pensioners. The party aims to fund these proposals by scrapping net-zero climate measures, ending hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, and cutting diversity initiatives in the public sector.</p>

Former Newark Councilwoman Gayle Chaneyfield Jenkins accused Baraka's administration of widespread abuse where women were pressured for sexual favors for jobs.

          <p>National Public Radio (NPR) has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an executive order to cease all federal funding for the nonprofit broadcaster. NPR argues that the order violates the First Amendment's protections for speech and the press and infringes on Congress' authority. The lawsuit asserts that the order aims to punish and control NPR's news coverage, which the administration deems biased. NPR and other public radio stations contend that the order threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans rely on for essential news and information.</p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, are speaking out against a proposal by Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). They argue that eliminating the PCAOB, created in the wake of those scandals, would increase the risk of corporate disasters and accounting fraud. The PCAOB is an independent regulator that oversees public company audits, and its independence from the SEC is crucial for ensuring audit quality. The authors emphasize the importance of maintaining strong safeguards to prevent future financial collapses and protect investors.</p>

          <p>A report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates a significant discrepancy between the official unemployment rate and the "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April. LISEP's measure includes not only unemployed workers but also those seeking full-time employment who can't find it, and those in poverty-wage jobs. This metric aims to capture nuances missed by traditional indicators, such as the number of Americans left behind during economic expansion. The report suggests that millions of households are struggling to maintain a minimal quality of life, earning far less than needed to cover basic costs.</p>

Immigration experts argue that these changes would primarily affect U.S. citizen children with noncitizen parents and authorized immigrants, potentially undermining their well-being.

          <p>After more than 50 years, Southwest Airlines is ending its "bags fly free" policy, introducing a $35 fee for the first checked bag and a $45 fee for the second checked bag. The new policy applies to flights booked on May 28 or later, although certain customers, such as Business Select/Choice Extra and A-List Preferred members, will receive two free checked bags, while A-List and Chase Rapid Reward credit card members will get one free checked bag. Southwest announced the change in March amid pressure to improve its financial performance, and the airline also said it would start selling assigned seats.</p>

          <p>European sales of Tesla vehicles experienced a significant decline in April, dropping 49% year-on-year, as the company faces reputational damage and increasing competition. This decrease occurred even as overall battery electric car sales in Europe rose 34.1% annually. Tesla has faced brand damage due to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement with Donald Trump, leading to protests at Tesla dealerships across Europe. At the same time, Tesla is battling rising competition from traditional automakers and aggressive Chinese players, and European consumers show a preference for hybrid electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced rapid weight gain and swelling, which led to a diagnosis of pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens. Despite numerous tests, doctors initially struggled to identify the cause of his symptoms, which included fatigue and shortness of breath. Cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected the condition, but open-heart surgery was necessary for confirmation and treatment. The surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, involved removing a thick shell of scarring from Mauceri's heart, leading to a full recovery and a return to conducting.</p>

          <p>As former Governor Andrew Cuomo emerges as a front-runner in the New York City mayoral race, critics are drawing comparisons between him and the current mayor, Eric Adams. Both are considered moderate Democrats who have taken conservative stances on various issues, including mental health and housing. The similarities have led to concerns that electing Cuomo would essentially result in a second term for Adams.
