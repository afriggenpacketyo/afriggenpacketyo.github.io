          <h2>Trump's Legal Team Pushes for Expedited Deposition of Rupert Murdoch in Defamation Suit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 13:02:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's lawyers are requesting an expedited deposition of Rupert Murdoch for a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the media mogul. The suit stems from a Wall Street Journal article detailing a "bawdy" birthday letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. Citing Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health concerns, Trump's legal team argues he may be unavailable to testify in person by the time the case goes to trial. The motion also seeks extensive digital communications and call logs from Murdoch related to the article's publication.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently decreased, offering a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. With average rates for both products now sitting around 8.25%, they present a potentially cheaper alternative to high-interest credit cards and personal loans. The article advises homeowners to carefully compare HELOCs and home equity loans, check offers from their current mortgage lender, and precisely determine their borrowing needs to avoid risk, as their home serves as collateral.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture to block a demand for the personal data of millions of food assistance recipients. The USDA has ordered states to submit detailed information, including names and Social Security numbers, for all Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applicants from the last five years, citing a need to curb fraud. The lawsuit argues this unprecedented request violates federal privacy laws and the Constitution, and is part of a broader Trump administration effort to weaponize sensitive data.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NPR, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg analyzed the Democratic Party's recent challenges and outlined a path for regaining public confidence. Buttigieg emphasized that the party cannot simply revert to a pre-Trump political status quo and must address the widespread distrust many Americans feel toward government institutions. He discussed the need for Democrats to connect more effectively with voters and understand the root causes of skepticism, including public disbelief surrounding official information like the Epstein files.</p>

The British Medical Association (BMA) reported receiving requests for over 125 doctors to leave picket lines, approving some while claiming others were inappropriate. The dispute arises from the BMA's demand for a 29% pay increase to offset over a decade of wage erosion.

          <p>A severe heat wave is currently impacting about half of the United States, with over 198 million people under heat advisories and warnings. The extreme temperatures are concentrated in the Midwest, Southeast, and parts of the Northeast, with alerts expected to last through Wednesday in some areas. Multiple cities are forecasting temperatures in the high 90s, with "feels-like" temperatures exceeding 100 degrees. In addition to the heat, some northern Midwest states are also facing threats of severe storms, including a potential derecho with wind gusts over 75 mph.</p>

          <p>Behind England's Euro 2025 victory was a carefully cultivated team environment designed to feel like a "home away from home." The Football Association provided a five-star hotel where players could relax with hobbies like building Lego, playing the piano, and enjoying specialized tea, creating a calm atmosphere. Family members were integrated into the camp, and a team barista even brought his dog, Reggie, to boost morale. This focus on camaraderie and mental well-being was credited with building the resilience needed to win the championship.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russia to reach a peace agreement with Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12 days. He stated his disappointment with President Vladimir Putin and the lack of progress toward a deal, threatening to impose massive "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trading partners if the new deadline is not met. Trump expressed frustration over Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, marking a shift from his past avoidance of criticizing the Russian leader. The move escalates pressure on Moscow to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly moving forward with plans to retrofit a Boeing jumbo jet donated by Qatar for potential use as Air Force One. The aircraft, valued at $400 million, was given as an "unconditional" gift, with the U.S. government bearing the cost of necessary modifications and security inspections. The deal has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum, with some questioning the legality and ethics of accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign power. The White House has maintained the donation is legal and plans to transfer the plane to Trump's presidential library after his term.</p>

While standard screening lines may become faster, trusted traveler programs provide a consistently less stressful and more efficient experience, with 99% of PreCheck passengers waiting less than 10 minutes. For frequent travelers, the convenience and time savings can be well worth the enrollment fee, which some credit cards will cover.</p>

He will seek the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. In his announcement, Cooper framed his campaign as a fight to preserve the American middle class, criticizing recent federal policies that he argued favor corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working families. His entry into the race is seen by national Democrats as a strong opportunity to flip the Senate seat in a key battleground state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein occurred years ago after he banned him from the Mar-a-Lago club for "inappropriate" behavior. Trump claimed the issue was that Epstein had "stole people that work for me," hiring his employees away even after being warned not to. The president said he threw Epstein out and cut off contact, calling him "persona non grata." This explanation comes amid renewed questions about their relationship following the attorney general's decision not to release certain investigative files related to the deceased sex offender.</p>
