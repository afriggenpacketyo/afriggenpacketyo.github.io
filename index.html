          <p>A 15-year-old boy has admitted to the manslaughter of Harvey Willgoose, also 15, who was stabbed at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield. The defendant, who cannot be named due to his age, pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denied murder at Sheffield Crown Court. He also admitted to possessing a blade on school premises. A murder trial has been scheduled for June 30, and the boy remains in youth detention custody as the case proceeds, with the community grappling with the tragic loss of a young life amidst a backdrop of school violence.</p>

          <p>A U.S. airstrike in Yemen has reportedly killed at least 68 people at a migrant detention center in the Saada Governorate, according to Yemen's Civil Defense organization. The strike also injured 47 others, and the center housed around 100 African migrants. The U.S. military's Central Command stated that its campaign since March 15 has struck over 800 targets, killing hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders in response to Houthi attacks on shipping and strikes on Israel. This incident raises concerns about the protection of civilians in conflict zones and the broader implications of U.S. military actions in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Pay review bodies have recommended that UK ministers approve pay raises of up to 4% for teachers and 3% for NHS staff, exceeding the government's budgeted 2.8%.

Rejecting the recommendations could lead to strikes, as teaching unions have already threatened action if pay rises trigger cuts or layoffs.

          <p>Trump Coins, a venture launched by President Donald Trump, is attributing the recent surge in gold prices to his return to the spotlight and economic policies. However, experts argue that the rising gold value reflects financial uncertainty caused by Trump's policies, including widespread tariffs. They suggest that gold prices typically increase during economic turmoil, signaling displeasure with the president's economic strategies. While Trump Coins profits from the rising gold prices through commemorative medallions, experts recommend investing in gold ETFs for better long-term performance (not investment advice).</p>
