          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated Jacob Fearnley in the French Open third round, in a match notably disrupted by fireworks from a nearby Champions League final celebration at PSG's stadium. Norrie, currently ranked 81st, leveraged his experience to overcome Fearnley, who is ranked 55th, in straight sets. Norrie acknowledged the difficulty in maintaining focus due to the constant noise, while Fearnley downplayed the impact of the distractions on his performance. Norrie is set to face Novak Djokovic in the next round, marking the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the French Open last 16.</p>

          <p>Eric Spofford, former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers in New Hampshire, was arrested for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists from New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR). The alleged stalking was in retaliation for an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Spofford during his time as CEO. Spofford allegedly hired individuals to vandalize the journalists' homes, and those individuals were previously convicted and sentenced. Spofford had previously filed a defamation lawsuit against NHPR, which was dismissed in 2023, and he is scheduled to appear in federal court.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing severe drought conditions following one of the driest springs on record, impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and potentially consumer prices. The lack of rainfall has led to exceptionally dry soil, increasing wildfire risk and hindering groundwater recharge. Experts warn that the situation could worsen if significant rainfall does not occur soon, stressing plants and ecosystems. Efforts to conserve water and promote water retention strategies are being emphasized to mitigate the effects of the drought.</p>

          <p>During a town hall in Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst faced intense questioning about proposed cuts to safety net programs in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Ernst defended the bill, arguing that ineligible individuals would be removed from programs like Medicaid. When a member of the crowd expressed concern that people would die as a result, Ernst responded, "Well, we all are going to die," which drew disapproval from the audience. The bill, which includes tax cuts and slashes to social programs, is facing pushback in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized a new rule implemented at the Spanish Grand Prix that aims to limit front wing flexibility, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA introduced a stiffer load test to reduce the aerodynamic advantage gained from flexible front wings. Hamilton stated that the rule has not changed anything significantly and has only resulted in teams spending more money on new wings. He added that the changes felt almost identical in the simulator and the money could have been better used for charitable purposes.</p>
