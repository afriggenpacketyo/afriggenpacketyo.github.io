          <p>The New York Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to reveal the attendees of President Trump's exclusive dinner and White House tour for top holders of his $TRUMP memecoin. Invitees included Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire previously sued by the SEC, and various crypto executives. Trump's leveraging of his position for financial gain through his crypto business raised eyebrows, and the event highlighted the intersection of cryptocurrency and political influence. Matthew Liu, co-founder of Origin, defended the event, emphasizing its focus on industry growth and collaboration with regulators. The digital world had become physical, as attendees' names and contact information were delineated on paper lists, checked by staffers at the door.</p>

          <p>The White House is undergoing a restructuring of the National Security Council, significantly reducing its size and reassigning staff, according to CBS News sources. This follows President Trump's appointment of Marco Rubio as National Security Advisor, replacing Mike Waltz. Vice President JD Vance's national security advisor, Andy Baker, is set to take on a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security advisor, along with White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel. The move reflects Trump's preference for a top-down approach to foreign policy, with fewer staff involved in the decision-making process. Some former NSC members expressed concern that fewer personnel could lead to less control over the bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer convicted in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the movie "Rust," has been released from a New Mexico prison after completing her 18-month sentence, ABC News reports. She was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March 2024. Gutierrez-Reed is also under probation for unlawfully carrying a gun into a licensed liquor establishment. Alec Baldwin, who was holding the gun when it discharged, initially faced an involuntary manslaughter charge, but it was later dismissed.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Global Change Biology reveals that the increasing use of hummingbird feeders has led to changes in the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbird beaks, according to NPR. The beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, while males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competition. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward into cooler climates. Researchers tracked hummingbird feeder mentions in newspaper archives and studied museum specimens to observe these evolutionary changes. This shows how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of organisms, although the long-term consequences remain uncertain.</p>

Kardashian, who testified earlier this month, stated that she feared for her life during the ordeal and expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice. The ringleader, Aomar Aït Khedache, had sought forgiveness from Kardashian, who stated she forgave him.

          <p>Investigators are examining whether technical issues at a San Diego airport, including a power outage affecting runway lights and weather data, contributed to a fatal plane crash, according to the BBC. The Cessna 550 struck high-tension power lines before crashing into a residential neighborhood near Montgomery Field Airport, killing all six people on board. The Automated Surface Observing Station was inoperative due to a power surge, and the runway lighting system had an issue. The pilot did not report any problems or declare an emergency before the crash. The NTSB is investigating the incident, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days.</p>

The dinner drew criticism, with Senator Jeff Merkley protesting outside and calling for the End Crypto Corruption Act. The event has complicated stablecoin regulation efforts in Congress, and there are concerns that political infighting over Trump's crypto ventures could derail the GENIUS Act.

Despite concerns from civil rights groups and politicians, authorities credited facial recognition cameras run by Project N.O.L.A. with helping recapture one fugitive. Critics argue that the technology raises constitutional and privacy issues, with the ACLU calling for a halt to the program. The New Orleans Police Department recently paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. pending legal review, yet it still used the system during the manhunt.

          <h2>Government Delays Publication of Child Poverty Strategy</h2>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, which was originally due in the spring, according to the BBC. A spokesperson stated that the strategy will be published later this year and will include fully-funded measures to tackle the root causes of child poverty. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. While some critics have condemned the delay, others suggest it may allow for a more substantial and effective strategy. The two-child benefit cap prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates, including concerts scheduled up to July 2026, following a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), CBS News reports. The condition, which affects hearing, vision, and balance, has been exacerbated by recent performances. Joel's doctor advised him to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. NPH is a brain condition where fluid builds up, disrupting brain functions and causing symptoms such as difficulty walking, thinking, and urinary incontinence. The condition is treatable with surgery, and those who had purchased tickets to an upcoming performance will be automatically refunded.</p>

          <p>ABC News reports that a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Harvard sued the administration, alleging the move was a violation of the First Amendment. The Trump administration had claimed the school lost its ability to use the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) due to non-compliance with information requests. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a "critical step" to protect the rights of international students. The ruling is the latest development in the administration's standoff with the university.</p>

          <p>Federal prison officials visited Alcatraz Island last week following President Trump's announcement of plans to reopen the infamous prison, which has been closed for over 60 years, according to The Guardian. Superintendent David Smith said officials with the Federal Bureau of Prisons are planning to return for further structural assessments. The island facility was closed in 1963 due to high operating costs and escape attempts. The Trump administration has moved to reopen at least five previously closed detention centers and prisons. California lawmakers have dismissed the Alcatraz proposal, but the Trump administration is actively working to reopen other facilities.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss announced their departure from the law firm after it reached a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order that would have restricted its business, according to the New York Times. The departing partners, Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, will form their own law firm. The departure follows criticism of the firm's chairman, Brad Karp, for making the deal with Trump. The lawyers expressed gratitude for their time at Paul Weiss and hope to continue collaborating in the future.</p>
