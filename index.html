          <p>Hayley McNeff, a nationally ranked bodybuilder, nutritionist, and life coach, has passed away at the age of 37. Her family described her death as "unexpected but peaceful," remembering her as a determined and energetic individual who was a "beam of light." A native of Massachusetts, McNeff was a champion in her sport, winning the 2009 East Coast Classic before later pursuing a degree in psychology. Her obituary celebrated her quick wit, sense of humor, and the strong, lasting relationships she nurtured with friends and family.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after the conflict with Hamas began, Israel is experiencing profound internal divisions over the war's continuation and its humanitarian toll in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains a stance of total victory, but faces growing opposition from hostage families demanding a deal and anti-war demonstrators protesting the killing of Palestinian civilians. Public opinion polls reveal a stark divide, with a majority of Jewish Israelis expressing little concern for Palestinian suffering, a sentiment critics attribute to a trauma response from the October 7 attacks and a lack of media coverage on Gaza's crisis. These societal fractures are further exacerbated by tensions between secular and religious-nationalist groups.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting to commend Texas House Democrats for leaving the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. He praised their courage, stating their actions are a crucial part of a longer struggle to protect democracy from partisan gerrymandering. Joined by former Attorney General Eric Holder, Obama emphasized that the fight against what he termed a "systematic assault on democracy" is being watched nationally. The meeting's virtual nature was attributed to security concerns, which Democrats claim are intimidation tactics by Texas Republicans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare for a summit in Alaska, their primary objectives appear to diverge significantly. Putin seeks international recognition and a validation that Western efforts to isolate him have failed, using the meeting to project Russia's status as a global power. He aims to secure Russia's territorial gains in Ukraine and may use the historical context of Alaska's sale to the U.S. to justify modern border changes. Conversely, Trump is driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker, hoping to broker an end to the war in Ukraine, a goal that aligns with his 2024 campaign promises and personal ambition for a Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan for a November 4 special election to ask voters to approve a new congressional map, a direct countermeasure to Republican redistricting efforts in Texas. The "Election Rigging Response Act" would temporarily override the state's independent commission to create districts more favorable to Democrats, a move Newsom framed as necessary to "meet fire with fire" against threats to democracy. The announcement was marked by tension, as federal Border Patrol agents conducted an operation outside the venue, which Newsom and other officials called an act of intimidation by the Trump administration. The new map would only take effect if a Republican state like Texas proceeds with its own partisan gerrymandering.</p>

At 45 years old, she received a wild card invitation for what will be her 25th appearance in the singles championship. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and two-time U.S. Open winner, continues a trend of longevity in professional tennis, where athletes often compete well into their 30s and 40s. Her participation follows a recent victory at the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004.</p>

          <p>Three rare, hand-labeled aluminum audition records made by Dame Vera Lynn 90 years ago are set to be released for the first time. The recordings were discovered by her daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, after she donated her mother's record collection to the British Library's Sound Archive. The discs, along with a rare copy of her first 1935 record, offer a glimpse into the very beginning of the career of the singer who would become known as the "Forces' Sweetheart" during World War Two. A single from the collection will be released to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, with a full album of rare tracks to follow in November.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, it faces growing concerns over its long-term financial stability and operational capacity. The program, which supports nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to see its trust funds depleted by 2034, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if no action is taken. This financial pressure is compounded by an aging population and a recent record number of beneficiaries. Additionally, critics have raised concerns about the agency's ability to serve the public following staffing cuts made by the Trump administration, though the White House contends that efficiency has improved.</p>

A key point of contention is whether the launches, many of which deploy Starlink satellites for commercial internet, should be classified as federal activity exempt from state permits. The commission argued that the primary purpose is commercial, not governmental, and criticized the Air Force for not providing sufficient information to ensure the project's consistency with California's coastal management policies.</p>

Ford CEO Jim Farley has signaled a drastic shift in strategy, announcing a new, cheaper electric truck to be produced in 2027 using a redesigned, more efficient assembly process inspired by competitors like Tesla. This move is a direct response to Chinese EVs like the Xiaomi SU7, which offer superior technology at a fraction of the cost of American vehicles. While tariffs currently protect the U.S. market, the global proliferation of these cars puts immense pressure on legacy automakers to innovate or risk becoming obsolete.</p>

          <p>King Charles will deliver a personal message to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day, honoring the service and sacrifice that ended World War Two. In a recorded message, the King will vow that those who fought and died in the Pacific and Far East "shall never be forgotten." The commemoration, attended by the King, Queen, and Prime Minister, will take place at the National Memorial Arboretum.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is forecast to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season by Friday. The storm is currently moving west from the Cabo Verde islands and is projected to become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands by the end of the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. Tropical storm watches have been issued for the northern Leeward Islands, which are expected to be near the storm's center over the weekend.</p>

          <p>A regulatory filing has revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered insurer UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen nearly 50% this year amid public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation. However, the move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in troubled companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock rose 6% in extended trading, as the investment signals confidence from one of the world's most respected investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI-powered software company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge since its 2020 public debut, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its market valuation exceeding $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been lucrative government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its astronomical valuation, which dwarfs that of tech giants with far greater revenue, the company's commercial business is also showing strong growth. The stock's high forward price-to-earnings ratio indicates that investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its future in AI. (not investment advice)</p>

This position was praised by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative anti-abortion group that had advocated against retailers selling the medication.

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency, the virus continues to spread rapidly in Africa, with outbreaks now in 24 countries. A new, more transmissible strain that emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo is driving the surge, but experts warn that case numbers are severely undercounted due to limited surveillance and diagnostic capacity. Critics argue the global response has been dangerously inadequate, citing stalled vaccine donations and funding cuts to global health aid. This lack of containment raises fears that the virus is becoming entrenched in the human population, posing a long-term threat.</p>

          <p>On its 90th anniversary, the Social Security program is facing a significant financial shortfall that could impact future benefits. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, at which point incoming payroll taxes would only cover about 81% of scheduled benefits. In response, bipartisan proposals are emerging in Congress to address the solvency crisis. One plan, co-led by Senators Bill Cassidy and Tim Kaine, suggests creating a new $1.5 trillion investment fund to generate higher returns, while another proposal from Representative John Larson focuses on increasing taxes on high earners to fund and enhance benefits.</p>
