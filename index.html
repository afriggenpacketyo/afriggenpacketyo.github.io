          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition, homeschooling, or virtual learning. The program will provide families with $10,000 per year, with up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, and will initially cover 90,000 students. Republicans have advocated for this program for years, emphasizing parental empowerment and alternatives to underperforming public schools. Critics, mainly Democrats and rural Republicans, argue it will drain resources from public education and benefit wealthy families, with the Texas Democratic Party chairman calling it beneficial only for the richest people in the state. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein of The New York Times posits that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift from a coalition government in his first term to a 'royal court' in his second. The article argues that Vance, unlike other contenders, fully embraced the MAGA movement and loyalty to Trump, marking a departure from advisers who previously curbed Trump's impulses. Klein asserts that Trump's second term is characterized by loyalists and enforcers, with the absence of dissenting voices leading to a more reckless and unrestrained presidency. The piece emphasizes that this structure was clear with the Vance pick, promising no concessions or skeptics.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has banned Malta's 'golden passport' program, the last of its kind in the EU, which offered citizenship to foreign investors. The court ruled that such schemes undermine EU solidarity by making nationality a mere commercial transaction. Malta's Prime Minister defended the program, saying it had raised millions for charitable causes, but the government will rework the system to comply with the ruling. While 'golden passports' are now ruled out, 'golden visas,' offering residence permits for investment, remain available in many EU countries, raising concerns about security and money laundering risks.</p>

This election was Wong's first as prime minister, and was dominated by cost of living issues, jobs and economic growth, according to local media outlet CNA. Wong, who is also finance minister, took over from Lee Hsien Loong in May 2024. Early Sunday morning, the U.S. State Department congratulated Wong on the PAP's victory, saying it looks forward to working closely with the new government to strengthen economic growth and defense ties.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., has made significant gains in English local elections, challenging the dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. The article notes that the Conservatives suffered disastrous results, while Labour also faced voter dissatisfaction, creating an opening for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and Greens. Reform U.K.'s surge is attributed to Farage's vigorous campaigning and public disenchantment with the main parties. The rise of smaller parties is leading to a fragmentation of British politics, making future election outcomes increasingly unpredictable, and forcing the main parties to adapt to a more multi-faceted political landscape.</p>

          <p>Kumamoto Prefecture in southwestern Japan has launched a two-day bus tour featuring ten bronze statues of "One Piece" characters to boost tourism and recovery from the 2016 earthquakes. The statues, created by manga artist Eiichiro Oda, are located across nine municipalities, offering a chance to remember the disaster and witness reconstruction progress. The tour is currently for domestic tourists, but translation services may be added for international visitors. The tour also includes visits to a quake memorial museum and a disaster-hit local railway, priced at 28,000 yen per person.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's law requiring couples to adopt the same surname. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% of that group stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. The survey estimates that approximately 1.22 million people in their 20s to 50s are in common-law relationships, with 587,000 wishing to marry if separate surnames were allowed. Common-law couples lack benefits such as spouse tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with a net increase of nearly 12,000 coffee shops in the past year, driven by aggressive expansion and price competition. This growth is occurring as coffee culture spreads beyond major cities, and is being promoted by President Xi Jinping's support for domestic beans. Starbucks' market share has declined significantly, falling to 14% in 2024 from 34% in 2019, while new entrants and business models gain traction. The expansion is concentrated in second-tier and 'new first-tier' cities, such as Chengdu and Hangzhou.</p>
