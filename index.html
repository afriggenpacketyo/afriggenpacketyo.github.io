          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up partially in the country. Speaking on a podcast, she explained that her identity is now firmly British, as she has spent most of her life in the UK and considers it her home. Badenoch, who was born in the UK, returned to England at age 16 due to Nigeria's political and economic instability, an experience she says shaped her political views. Her comments follow previous criticism from Nigeria's vice president regarding her portrayal of the country.</p>

During a press conference in his native South Korea, a visibly emotional Son stated he needed a change and a new environment to challenge himself, leaving the club as a "very proud man." While his next destination is unconfirmed, there is speculation he may move to the MLS club Los Angeles FC. Son noted that leading Spurs to their first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League was a key factor in his decision to depart.</p>

          <p>Cambodia's government has announced its intention to nominate former U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in brokering a ceasefire to end a border conflict with Thailand. The country's deputy prime minister, Sun Chanthol, praised Trump's efforts, stating he deserved the award for helping to bring peace to the region. The ceasefire was negotiated after Trump urged both nations to halt the fighting, which had killed at least 43 people and displaced over 300,000. This follows similar nominations for Trump from officials in Israel and Pakistan for his involvement in other international conflict resolutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese researchers has revealed an unexpected evolutionary link between potatoes and tomatoes, finding that a tomato ancestor is a genetic parent of the modern potato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced the tuber's origin back nine million years to a hybridization event between a tomato forerunner and a tuberless potato-like plant. The findings, published in the journal Cell, suggest this ancient crossbreeding was a crucial step in the development of tubers. This research provides new insight into the origins of the potato, which is the world's third most consumed food crop.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC is on the brink of elimination from the 2025 Leagues Cup tournament despite securing a 4-2 penalty shootout victory against Mexican club Pachuca. The match ended in a 1-1 draw during regular time, with both teams seeing a player sent off after VAR reviews. LAFC's Denis Bouanga opened the scoring early, but Pachuca equalized shortly after LAFC's Nathan Ordaz received a red card. The result, which awards LAFC only two points, leaves the team with just three points from two games, making qualification for the quarterfinals highly unlikely in the competitive 18-team MLS group.</p>

          <p>A review of British newspaper headlines reveals major stories including President Trump's deployment of two nuclear submarines in response to statements from Russia, a move The Telegraph calls a break from decades of protocol. The Guardian reports on the NHS, highlighting that half of the six million people on waiting lists in England have not yet had their first specialist contact or diagnostic test. Other prominent stories include a Reform UK representative predicting a 70% chance of an election win and the man who attempted to kidnap Princess Anne in 1974 being released and campaigning to clear his name.</p>

          <p>A search is ongoing for a suspect who opened fire in The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, killing four people in what authorities described as a "senseless act of violence." The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, fled the scene and is considered armed and dangerous. Police have located the suspect's vehicle but not the individual, focusing their search on a highway west of the city. Authorities have urged residents in the area to remain indoors and on high alert as the manhunt continues while the motive for the shooting remains unknown.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's decision to block U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" in Southern California without reasonable suspicion. This ruling affirms a temporary restraining order that prevents agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race or location. The court rejected the Trump administration's argument that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts, stating that the government failed to show it would be chilled from conducting lawful stops. The decision is a significant setback for the administration's mass deportation strategy in the region.</p>

          <p>Amid a summer of intense heat and widespread wildfires across Greece, Turkey, and other European destinations, travel experts are advising tourists on their rights and options. Currently, the UK Foreign Office deems it safe to travel to these areas, which means standard travel insurance may not cover cancellations for those who choose not to go. However, policies with specific natural catastrophe coverage might offer protection. Experts recommend that travelers without such coverage should communicate directly with their airlines and hotels, as bespoke solutions are sometimes available. Airlines are generally required to provide care for significant delays or cancellations.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims, has released a new product described as shapewear for the face, sparking a debate about extreme beauty standards. The £52 wrap, which sold out quickly, is marketed to provide a "sculpted" jawline and taps into a TikTok trend of elaborate bedtime beauty rituals. While influencers have promoted the product, medical professionals express skepticism, stating there is no scientific evidence for lasting effects and warning of potential skin irritation. Critics argue the product fuels insecurities and promotes dystopian beauty ideals, sending a message that even natural features require alteration.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread user fatigue with conventional online dating, new apps are emerging that alter the traditional model of matching and messaging. One such app, Breeze, arranges a date at a partner venue immediately after a match, eliminating the pre-date chatting stage to encourage more direct, in-person connections. This trend reflects a broader industry shift, as major platforms like Tinder and Hinge also add new features to keep users engaged amid declining usage numbers.

The new rules mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require that all shipments be accompanied by qualified test reports. Upon arrival, Vietnamese durians will now be subject to "batch by batch" testing, with any non-compliant fruit being returned or destroyed and the associated exporter suspended from the Chinese market. These stricter measures follow a significant 45% year-on-year drop in the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China in the first half of 2025.</p>

They criticize von der Leyen for pledging $600 billion in EU investment in the US and for failing to resist Trump's demands.

This finding is significant for climate prediction, as the location of this rain belt is a primary determinant of summer drought and flood distribution in China.

          <p>Seal Beach lifeguards in Southern California are reporting a significant increase in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to as many as 15. Officials attribute the rise to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, combined with hot weather bringing more people to the beach. The area near the San Gabriel River, known as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, experts advise beachgoers to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish of their approach.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages after finding the company partially liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system that killed one person and seriously injured another. The jury concluded that while the driver was distracted, Tesla's driver-assistance technology failed to prevent the collision. The plaintiffs' lawyer argued that Tesla deliberately chose not to restrict Autopilot's use to controlled-access highways, despite designing it for such environments. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, calling it "wrong" and a setback for the development of life-saving automotive technology.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis by the Trump administration's own Environmental Protection Agency indicates that its plan to roll back greenhouse gas regulations would lead to higher gasoline prices for consumers. The report, reviewed by CBS News, contradicts the administration's public claims of creating savings, showing that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles would increase demand for gasoline and drive up costs. The analysis, citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency, also projected the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 under the proposed deregulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's decision to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, stating the president has "real concerns" about the accuracy of federal economic data. The defense came after Trump dismissed Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weak jobs report, which he claimed was "RIGGED." Greer told CBS News that large revisions in jobs numbers, like those seen in the recent report, justify the president's concerns about data reliability. The firing has drawn sharp criticism, including from McEntarfer's predecessor, who called it a "dangerous precedent" that undermines economic credibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on most countries, the average U.S. household could face over $2,000 in additional annual costs. Economists warn that prices for common imported goods like furniture, clothing, and cars will likely rise as businesses can no longer absorb the costs. The lack of clear implementation details is creating a "gigantic Rubik's Cube" for businesses, perpetuating instability rather than providing certainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Named Acrophylla alta, the massive insect is believed to be extremely elusive, likely inhabiting the highest canopies of remote, high-elevation rainforests. The discovery highlights the vast, unexplored biodiversity of these habitats and raises concerns among scientists that many species may be lost before they are even identified. The find underscores the importance of conservation and the study of invertebrates, which remain a largely unknown part of the ecosystem.</p>
