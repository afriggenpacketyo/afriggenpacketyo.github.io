          <h2>US Reverses Stance, Allowing Nvidia to Sell Advanced AI Chips to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its policy, permitting Nvidia to sell its H20 AI processors to Chinese customers. This decision effectively pauses a multi-year American effort to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductor technology crucial for AI development. While the H20 is a less powerful alternative to the flagship H100 chip, it is highly effective for certain tasks and more affordable, potentially accelerating China's AI capabilities. The move highlights the strategic importance of "compute" as a 21st-century commodity, altering the geopolitical balance in the tech race.</p>

          <h2>Greek Government Faces Scrutiny Over Handling of Increased Refugee Arrivals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Greece is experiencing a significant increase in refugee arrivals, particularly on the island of Crete, prompting strong rhetoric from government officials who have described it as an "invasion." Despite the rise, current numbers are vastly lower than the 2015 crisis, yet the political and societal response is more resistant. The government has suspended asylum applications for sea arrivals and plans harsher penalties for those refusing to leave. This policy of deterrence is seen by critics as a violation of European values, while officials explore a potential migration deal with Libya to manage the flow.</p>

          <p>The UK Defence Secretary has apologized for a major data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation after assisting British forces. The leak, which occurred in 2022, was kept secret by a super-injunction that was only recently lifted. While the government claims it is "highly unlikely" the breach increases the risk to those affected, it acknowledged being "unable to say for sure" if any deaths resulted from it. A special resettlement scheme has brought 4,500 people to the UK, but hundreds of soldiers and their families are believed to still be in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information on Jeffrey Epstein that she deems "credible," amid backlash from some supporters over the Justice Department's conclusion that no "client list" exists. This stance has created friction with some of Trump's allies and base, who have long called for full transparency on the matter. The President also questioned the public's "fascination" with the case, calling it "sordid but boring." The controversy highlights ongoing divisions and conspiracy theories surrounding the Epstein case within conservative circles.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in the year to June, marking its highest level since January 2024. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase to higher prices for food, clothing, and transport, including air and rail fares. This development complicates the Bank of England's upcoming decision on interest rates as it tries to balance controlling inflation with stimulating a recently shrinking economy. While average wages have risen, consumers on lower incomes are feeling the squeeze from the rising cost of daily necessities. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers suggest that providing basic income security in the first year, along with mentorship, could unlock the potential for an additional 1.6 million startups.

The ban prohibits using a hosepipe for activities like watering gardens or washing cars, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. The move has drawn criticism, with some pointing to the company's significant daily water loss from leaks as a contributing factor to the shortage.</p>

While investors see untapped potential, the influx of US money has raised concerns among fans about their clubs becoming "feeder" teams for larger counterparts.

          <h2>US States Begin Passing Laws to Protect Neural Data from Consumer Tech</h2>

          <p>Colorado, California, and Montana have enacted new privacy laws to protect "neural data"—information generated by a person's brain and nervous system. The legislation is a response to the rise of consumer wearable devices, like headphones and earbuds, that measure brain activity to monitor things like sleep and focus. Advocates worry that without regulation, this highly sensitive data could be exploited by companies or read in the future with more advanced AI. The new laws generally require express consent to collect or share brain data and give consumers the right to have their information deleted.</p>

          <p>For the first time in four years, Huawei has become the top-selling smartphone brand in mainland China, capturing an 18.1% market share in the second quarter, according to IDC. This resurgence highlights the company's strong brand appeal, even as its shipments saw a slight year-over-year decline. The overall Chinese smartphone market, however, contracted by 4%, reflecting weak consumer spending and reduced government subsidies. Apple, which ranked fifth, saw the smallest shipment decline among the top brands, benefiting from strategic price adjustments that made certain iPhone models eligible for subsidies.</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng has advocated for a global supply chain system based on free trade, issuing a warning against Western protectionist policies. Speaking at an international expo, He criticized countries that use "de-risking" as a pretext for imposing tariffs and promoting "manufacturing reshoring." He argued that such actions reduce the efficiency of the global economy and that there are no winners in trade wars. His comments come amid persistent economic tensions between China, the United States, and the European Union, and growing uncertainty over the future of global trade.</p>

          <p>The Colombian military is escalating its fight against drug trafficking groups by deploying its own armed drones capable of carrying explosives. This move is a response to the increased use of inexpensive, commercially available drones by criminal organizations to monitor drug operations and ambush security forces. While the government is now producing its own military-grade drones, it faces challenges, as criminals can adapt new technology much faster than the military. The drone warfare has also put civilians at risk, with imprecise, homemade explosives causing unintended casualties, including the death of a child.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to begin debate on a spending-cut package requested by President Trump, which targets foreign aid and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the parent of NPR and PBS. The 50-50 vote was broken by Vice President JD Vance after three moderate Republicans sided with Democrats. While the Senate version removes cuts to the PEPFAR AIDS relief program, it retains the defunding of the CPB. A last-minute compromise aims to find alternative funding for tribal radio stations, setting the stage for a contentious debate.</p>

          <p>Ten years after a catastrophic flood on the Blanco River killed 12 people and destroyed hundreds of structures, the town of Wimberley, Texas, is still in the process of recovery. The community has implemented new safety measures, such as additional river gauges, but recent deadly flooding in a nearby county has renewed calls for more robust preparedness, including a citywide siren system. Residents and business owners have rebuilt with resiliency in mind, but the emotional and financial toll of the disaster lingers. The event serves as a stark reminder of the increasing frequency of extreme weather in "Flash Flood Alley."</p>

          <p>Federal incentives for clean energy technologies, including tax credits for electric vehicles and rooftop solar panels, are ending under a new law signed by President Trump. The up to $7,500 tax credit for new EVs will expire after September 30, while the 30% credit for home solar and other energy-efficient upgrades will end on December 31. This creates a short window for consumers to take advantage of the savings, with experts predicting a "hurry-up-and-buy" dynamic. The end of these incentives could significantly slow the adoption of green technologies and impact the country's climate goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a reported decline in popularity, the recorder remains a cherished gateway instrument for teaching music fundamentals to young children in many schools. Educators praise it for being inexpensive, easy for small hands to manage, and simple for beginners to produce a sound, unlike other woodwinds. Originally a prominent instrument during the Renaissance, favored by figures like King Henry VIII, it was revived in the 20th century as a teaching tool. While often seen as a simple toy, experts note that the recorder is a serious instrument that is difficult to master.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "y'all," once a distinctly Southern American term, has become increasingly popular across the United States, especially among younger generations. Linguists attribute its rise to its utility in filling a gap in standard English for a clear second-person plural, and its inclusive, gender-neutral nature. The term's spread has been aided by long-term migration patterns and its prominent use in both country and hip-hop music. Its origins are believed to be a blend of Scots-Irish and West African linguistic influences, making it a uniquely American expression that is now gaining mainstream acceptance.</p>

          <p>According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff, the Trump administration has delayed and may cancel approximately $140 million in federal grants intended for fentanyl overdose response efforts. This funding, part of the Overdose To Action (OD2A) program, is described by public health officials as crucial for programs that have contributed to a recent decline in overdose deaths. The interruption is reportedly due to bureaucratic reviews by the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). State health departments have already paused spending in anticipation of the cuts, raising fears of a reversal in progress against the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>Germany is struggling to expand its high-voltage electricity grid quickly enough to keep pace with its rapid growth in renewable energy production. The new power lines, crucial for transporting wind energy from the north to industrial centers in the south, are hampered by lengthy approval processes, skilled labor shortages, and supply bottlenecks. Although the expansion plan was enacted in 2009, only a fraction of the projects are complete, with full completion not expected for another decade or more. The debate over using more expensive underground cables versus faster, cheaper overhead lines further complicates this critical energy transition.</p>
