          <p>Air Canada's plans to resume full service were thwarted after its 10,000 striking flight attendants defied a government order to end their strike. The union is demanding a new contract with improved compensation to address inflation and pay for all hours worked, not just time in the air. The ongoing labor dispute has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights, stranding more than 100,000 travelers globally during the peak summer travel period. The airline has been forced to delay its operational restart, now targeting Monday evening for a potential resumption of flights.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that Russia's persistent refusal to agree to a ceasefire is significantly complicating efforts to achieve a peace deal. His comments came ahead of a crucial meeting at the White House with U.S. and European leaders to coordinate their diplomatic strategy. The statement follows a summit where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region, a condition Kyiv firmly rejects. Zelenskyy maintains that a halt to the fighting is the essential first step before any substantive peace negotiations can occur.</p>

Doctors successfully removed 51 lesions, a chocolate cyst, and her appendix, providing significant relief from symptoms she had endured since her teenage years. By sharing her journey, Irwin aims to destigmatize the condition, which affects millions of women globally but is often misdiagnosed or dismissed.

          <p>A coalition of civil liberty and anti-racism groups is calling on London's Metropolitan Police to abandon its plan to deploy live facial recognition (LFR) technology at this year's Notting Hill Carnival. In a formal letter, the organizations described LFR as a mass surveillance tool that treats all attendees as suspects and cited concerns about its documented inaccuracies with women and people of color. The Met Police has defended the technology, stating that at the thresholds it uses, the system is accurate and will be a vital tool for keeping the massive event safe.</p>

          <p>Seventy-six Palestinian students from Gaza, many with full scholarships to attend top UK universities, are unable to travel to begin their courses. Their predicament stems from the closure of the UK's biometric registration center in Gaza and the absence of a safe exit route from the territory. In response, nearly 5,000 UK academics and over 100 MPs have signed letters urging the government to facilitate the students' safe passage. They argue that enabling their education is crucial for the future reconstruction of Gaza's academic and civil infrastructure.</p>

          <p>After his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has pivoted from his demand for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, now advocating for a direct path to a comprehensive peace agreement. This new stance aligns with Russia's long-held position that a ceasefire can only be part of a final deal addressing the conflict's root causes. The shift puts Trump at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who insists on a ceasefire as a precondition for talks. This development signals a significant change in U.S. diplomatic strategy ahead of Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to the White House.</p>

In this instance, a Palace player was positioned too close to the Chelsea wall as the shot was taken, leading the referee to overturn the goal.

          <h2>Economists Express Concern Over Inflationary Pressures Following July Data Reports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While financial markets appear optimistic about a potential interest rate cut, some economists are raising alarms after recent inflation data showed concerning underlying trends. A hotter-than-expected Producer Price Index for July, driven by a surge in services costs, mirrored a similar pattern in the Consumer Price Index. This persistent services inflation, which is not directly tied to tariffs, could complicate the Federal Reserve's decisions, creating tension between its goals of maintaining price stability and ensuring maximum employment.

          <h2>Analysis: Putin Gains Upper Hand in Summit, Leaving Ukraine and Europe in a Precarious Position</h2>

          <p>The recent summit in Anchorage is being widely analyzed as a strategic win for Vladimir Putin, who successfully advanced his diplomatic objectives without making significant concessions. The Russian leader resisted President Trump's call for an immediate ceasefire, instead persuading him to adopt the Kremlin's view that a comprehensive peace deal must be negotiated first. By securing the meeting, Putin undermined Western efforts to isolate him and sowed further discord between the United States and its European allies, placing Ukraine in an even more vulnerable position.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's deployment of federal and military assets in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles over local objections, mayors of other large, Democratic-run cities are preparing for similar confrontations. These city leaders argue that Trump is using crime and unrest as a pretext to override local authority for political purposes and to create distractions. Mayors are now coordinating with their police chiefs, city attorneys, and governors to develop legal and operational plans to resist what they see as a potential illegal usurpation of their local control.</p>

          <p>Transgender athlete Evie Parts has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Swarthmore College, claiming she was illegally removed from the women's track team because of her gender identity. The suit argues that the NCAA's policy, which limits women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth, violates federal and state anti-discrimination laws like Title IX. Parts alleges that her removal, which occurred the same day the NCAA implemented its new policy, caused her significant emotional distress and constituted unlawful discrimination.</p>
