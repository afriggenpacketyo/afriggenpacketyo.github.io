In a recent report, the budget carrier cited adverse market conditions, weak demand for domestic travel, and other financial challenges as reasons for its precarious position. This warning comes just months after the airline emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the company is now considering selling assets to secure needed liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is actively hiring vehicle operators in New York City to test its "automated driving systems," even though the company has not applied for the required city or state permits to conduct such tests. This move aligns with CEO Elon Musk's focus on developing a robotaxi network, but it proceeds without the regulatory approval that competitors like Waymo are currently seeking. The company's approach highlights its strategy of pushing technological boundaries, sometimes ahead of official authorization, while facing scrutiny over the safety and marketing of its autonomous driving features.</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures soaring above 30°C (86°F) for three consecutive days in several regions. The hot, dry weather has led to "nationally significant" water shortages, impacting farms, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk, with millions now under hosepipe bans. The heat has also caused disruptions to rail services and prompted calls for new workplace temperature regulations as the country grapples with the effects of more frequent and intense heatwaves.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a steady inflation reading, financial experts argue that pursuing debt forgiveness remains a critical strategy for many Americans. Credit card interest rates are still at historic highs, far outpacing the rate of inflation, which means carrying a balance remains financially punishing. Given ongoing economic uncertainties, including potential tariff impacts, addressing high-interest debt now is seen as a prudent move rather than waiting for potential economic improvements that may not materialize.

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been rescued after being lost for nine days in a remote, boggy region of British Columbia, Canada. The man, Andrew Barber, survived by building a shelter from moss and sticks, drinking pond water, and carving "HELP" on a rock to signal for aid. A search and rescue helicopter spotted his truck and later found him, severely dehydrated and with a leg injury, in what officials described as a "needle in a haystack" search.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index remained at a 2.7% annual increase in July, with falling gas and grocery prices helping to balance costs for consumers. However, economists note that underlying "core" inflation is rising, and the effects of recent tariffs are beginning to appear in the prices of goods like household furnishings and apparel. Experts predict these tariff-related price increases will become more significant in the coming months, complicating the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>
