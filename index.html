          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first significant federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation primarily targets the $250 billion stablecoin market, creating rules for banks and financial institutions to issue digital assets backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills. The administration and supporters in the crypto industry view this as a landmark step toward legitimizing digital currencies and integrating them into the mainstream financial system, potentially revolutionizing financial technology. The bill's passage followed some internal Republican debate, which the president claimed to have personally resolved. (not investment advice)</p>

The blast, which occurred in the facility's parking lot, is described by officials as an isolated incident and is currently under investigation by local and federal authorities, including the FBI and ATF. Sheriff Robert Luna noted this as the department's largest single-incident loss of life since its founding. The officers were reportedly handling an unexploded ordnance at the time of the detonation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has stated that nearly 60,000 metric tons of food assistance are currently being distributed globally, pushing back against reports that significant quantities of aid were being incinerated. Officials clarified that all food supplies expiring before October 2026 have already been programmed for delivery to crisis areas like Syria and Sudan. This defense comes after reports that the administration ordered the destruction of 500 tons of emergency food and follows the recent dissolution of USAID, with its responsibilities transferred to the State Department. The department is now under pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of its restructured foreign aid model.</p>

          <p>As part of the recently signed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' many travelers to the United States on nonimmigrant visas will now face a new $250 'visa integrity fee.' This charge applies to temporary visitors such as international students and skilled workers on H-1B visas. The law suggests the fee could be reimbursed if visa holders comply with all terms, including timely departure, though the process for collection and reimbursement has not yet been established. Critics, like the American Immigration Council, argue this and other new charges, including a $100 asylum application fee, create significant financial hurdles for legal immigration pathways.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center indicates that the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' signed by President Trump will result in tax savings for all income groups, averaging around $2,900 per household in 2026. The law extends many provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips. However, the report highlights that higher-income households will receive a disproportionately larger benefit, with the top 20% of earners capturing about 60% of the total tax breaks. This finding aligns with public perception that the law favors the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

While considered safer than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins still carry risks, such as 'depegging' from their asset, as seen during the 2023 bank failures.

          <p>The parents of Kaylee Goncalves, one of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022, say they are still without answers regarding the killer's motive, even after Bryan Kohberger pleaded guilty. In an interview, Steve and Kristi Goncalves expressed frustration that the plea deal, which spared Kohberger the death penalty, did not require a full confession or explanation for the crime. With a gag order now lifted, the family's attorney plans to request all investigative materials from prosecutors. The family wants to understand the full, ugly truth of what happened to their daughter to inform their victim impact statements.</p>

          <p>American Express reported strong second-quarter spending, with transactions on its cards jumping 7%, indicating its affluent customer base continues to spend freely on goods and services. However, the company noted a specific area of weakness: spending on domestic economy class airfare was flat compared to a year ago. In contrast, spending on premium cabin flights and luxury hotels saw robust growth. This slowdown in a key travel segment, combined with declining airfare prices and increased competition in the premium card market, has raised some investor concerns despite the company's overall positive performance.

The move came shortly after a report that a letter with Trump's signature was found in Epstein's possession. While Bondi stated the Justice Department was ready to file the motion, federal rules typically keep grand jury materials secret, and it is uncertain if a judge will grant the request.

The report identified 11 separate U.S. storms that each caused at least a billion dollars in insured damage. The increasing frequency and severity of weather events are pushing the insurance industry toward a 'new market reality' of consistently high annual losses.</p>

Calculations show that based on today's rates, a money market account would earn slightly more over terms ranging from 18 months to five years. However, because money market rates will likely change, the guaranteed rate of a long-term CD may prove to be the safer and more lucrative option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The nation's 37 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) are facing a potential existential threat due to a proposed 90% cut in federal operations funding in President Trump's 2026 budget. These institutions, which are heavily reliant on federal money guaranteed by treaties, are already significantly underfunded. Leaders of the schools and advocates from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium warn that such drastic cuts would force many TCUs to close, devastating Indigenous education and local economies. They are currently lobbying Congress to uphold the federal government's trust and treaty responsibilities to fund these vital institutions.</p>
