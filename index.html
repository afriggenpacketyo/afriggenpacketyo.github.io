          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' marking the first Kannada language book to receive the honor. The stories, translated by Deepa Bhasthi, explore the hardships faced by Muslim women in southern India. Mushtaq's work, influenced by her own experiences with religious conservatism and patriarchal society, focuses on the value of attention to marginalized lives and unnoticed choices. This recognition has brought increased attention to Mushtaq's life and literary contributions, highlighting the challenges faced by women in conservative societies.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act, legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients with six months or less to live, making Delaware the 11th state to permit the practice. The law, effective next year, allows mentally capable adults to request a prescription to end their lives. Before obtaining the prescription, patients must be presented with alternative end-of-life care options, undergo two waiting periods, and receive a second medical opinion on their prognosis. This signing concludes nearly a decade of debate on the issue, reflecting a growing trend in recognizing patient autonomy in end-of-life decisions.</p>

          <p>Manchester United and Tottenham are set to compete in the Europa League final, but both teams have faced significant challenges this season. Experts debate which team has had a worse season, with arguments focusing on United's self-inflicted issues and managerial changes versus Tottenham's underperformance and injury setbacks. Despite the difficulties, both teams have the opportunity to salvage their seasons with a victory in the final. The outcome could impact the future of Tottenham's manager and determine whether United's mid-season changes were justified.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that U.S. export controls on AI chips to China have been ineffective, as Chinese companies are increasingly turning to locally developed technology. Huang noted that Nvidia's market share in China has significantly decreased due to these controls, leading to increased investment and development within China's semiconductor industry. China has also criticized the U.S. for discriminatory measures and called for immediate correction of these wrongdoings. The U.S. government's actions aim to prevent China from advancing its military systems and challenging American dominance in AI.</p>

Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, clarifying that habeas corpus is a legal principle protecting individuals from unlawful detention. Noem's inaccurate statement echoed the Trump administration's expansive view of presidential power, sparking debate over the potential suspension of habeas corpus for immigrants. Legal experts assert that only Congress has the authority to suspend this right, which has occurred only four times in American history.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to temporarily halt its bonus scheme for senior executives, following criticism that it was trying to circumvent rules banning bonuses for water company bosses. The scheme, which could have amounted to 50% of senior executives' pay packets, was linked to securing a Â£3 billion rescue loan for the troubled company. The decision comes after Downing Street stated that rewarding executives for mismanagement was unacceptable. Thames Water will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations and turnaround objectives.</p>

Eto clarified that he does buy white rice and his comment referred to brown rice, which he wants to promote.

          <p>A new study has found that high doses of radiation therapy, commonly used to target and destroy cancer cells, could paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre discovered that high doses of radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even when those tumors had not directly received radiation therapy. This groundbreaking work suggests that while radiation therapy is effective for controlling localized tumors, it may have unintended consequences on distant metastases.</p>

          <p>The world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with fires overtaking land clearances for agriculture as the primary cause. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests were lost, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, contributing to the spread of fires. South East Asia bucked the trend due to government policies enforcing "no burning" laws, but consistent protection policies are needed globally to prevent irreversible decline.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled plans for his "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to complete the ambitious project by the end of his term. The system, designed to protect against foreign attacks, faces logistical and financial challenges. While Trump allocated $25 billion from his tax cut and spending bill, the Congressional Budget Office estimates costs ranging from $161 billion to $542 billion. Experts question the feasibility of defending America's vast territory against intercontinental missiles, drawing parallels to Ronald Reagan's failed "Star Wars" initiative.</p>

          <p>Malaysia's semiconductor industry, a crucial part of the global supply chain, faces uncertainty due to President Trump's trade policies. While Malaysia has benefited from the U.S.'s desire to limit China's access to advanced chips, potential tariffs could undermine its growth. Trump is considering a blanket levy on semiconductor imports, potentially disrupting Malaysia's ambitious plan to build high-tech chips. The industry is closely monitoring the situation, as disruptions could lead to higher costs for American consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with the Amazon rainforest particularly affected. Wildfires are becoming more intense due to climate change, drying out forests and making them more susceptible to fire. While some countries like Indonesia and Malaysia reduced forest loss through prevention and response efforts, global efforts are needed to combat this alarming trend.</p>

          <p>While media focuses on young men supposedly fueling the far right, a more significant shift is occurring among young women, who are increasingly turning towards the left. Research shows that young people hold more progressive values than previous generations, with young women being more supportive of issues like abortion rights, feminism, environmental protection, and redistribution. This shift presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, rather than pandering to reactionary politics.</p>
