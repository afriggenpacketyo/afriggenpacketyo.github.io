          <p>President Donald Trump warned that a prolonged government shutdown could result in a 'substantial' number of federal jobs being permanently lost, a departure from the typical practice of furloughing workers. He squarely blamed Democrats for the impasse, asserting the party has 'no leader' with whom to negotiate and drawing a comparison to Somalia. Trump also framed the shutdown as an opportunity for his administration to eliminate 'billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse' from the federal budget. His comments intensify the political pressure surrounding the funding dispute, suggesting some workers may not return to their jobs even after a resolution is reached.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been convicted of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass and her colleague Katie Breathwick. The man, Peter Windsor, sent numerous unwanted and alarming items to their workplace over a four-year period, including a gun, handcuffs, and a police uniform. During the trial, Ms. Klass described her 'sheer terror' upon learning of the escalating harassment. Windsor, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, now faces sentencing, which could include prison or a hospital order, bringing a close to what the presenter called a 'horrific year' for her family.</p>

          <p>During a White House visit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump described the U.S.-Canada relationship as having both 'mutual love' and 'natural conflict,' particularly regarding trade. While hailing progress, Trump offered few specifics on lifting steep U.S. tariffs and suggested the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) could be renegotiated. Carney's visit aims to improve relations ahead of the USMCA's review next year, though he pushed back on the word 'conflict,' emphasizing areas where the two nations are stronger together. The meeting highlights ongoing tensions in one of North America's most critical alliances.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media reports that 580 hikers, along with 300 local support staff, have been successfully guided to safety after being stranded by a severe blizzard near Mount Everest. The tourists were caught at an altitude of over 16,000 feet when heavy snowfall blocked their route on the mountain's eastern slopes during a peak holiday season. The rescue operation involved police, firefighters, and hundreds of local Tibetan volunteers who mobilized to assist the stranded groups, some of whom were experiencing hypothermia. A final small group of hikers is still en route to a rendezvous point with emergency supplies.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner are traveling to Egypt to participate in ongoing, indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas. The negotiations, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, are centered on a peace plan proposed by President Trump aimed at ending the two-year war in Gaza. Key sticking points remain, including Hamas's demand for guarantees that Israel will not resume hostilities after hostages are released. The U.S.-backed plan envisions an Israeli withdrawal, Hamas disarmament, and the establishment of an international governing body for Gaza, a proposal that has received widespread international support but has yet to be fully accepted by Hamas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees looking to buy a new home may be able to use a specific type of reverse mortgage known as a HECM for Purchase loan. This financial tool allows seniors aged 62 and older to combine a significant down payment, typically from the sale of their current home, with reverse mortgage proceeds to buy a new primary residence without incurring monthly mortgage payments. This option can be attractive for those who are 'house rich but cash limited,' freeing up fixed retirement income. However, borrowers must still cover property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and the loan becomes due when they permanently move out or pass away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding a Colorado law banning 'conversion therapy' for minors, with conservative justices expressing skepticism about the state's authority to regulate professional speech. The case pits a therapist's First Amendment rights against the state's power to enforce standards of care based on the consensus of major medical organizations, which widely oppose the practice. Justices like Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch questioned the reliability of medical consensus itself, drawing parallels to past erroneous scientific beliefs. The arguments suggest the court is likely to strike down the ban, potentially impacting state regulation of healthcare more broadly.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the New York Federal Reserve indicates that Americans are growing more pessimistic about their personal financial situations due to rising inflation expectations. The monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations found that fewer people believe their household finances will improve in the coming year, and expectations for household spending growth have declined. This souring outlook is largely driven by persistent high costs for essentials like groceries, which influences public perception of the economy. Despite these concerns, overall consumer spending has remained relatively strong, a key factor that has so far helped the U.S. economy avoid a significant slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over the current government shutdown, historical market data suggests that such events have rarely derailed equities for long. An analysis of the S&P 500's performance following 10 previous shutdowns shows that the market often posts gains both during and after the political stalemates. For example, the index rose 36% in the year after the 2019 shutdown. Experts note that markets tend to be forward-looking and often discount recurring political drama that doesn't alter long-term economic fundamentals. This historical trend suggests that a patient, stay-invested approach has typically rewarded investors through periods of government uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

They will serve 12 months of home confinement followed by six months under a curfew, in addition to community service.

          <p>A new study suggests that for thousands of years, massive earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered subsequent large quakes on California's northern San Andreas fault within a short timeframe. Researchers analyzed ancient submarine landslide deposits, proposing that a magnitude 9 Cascadia event in 1700 was likely followed within hours or days by a major San Andreas quake. This 'one-two punch' scenario has significant implications for disaster preparedness, as emergency resources for the entire country would be strained by two near-simultaneous catastrophic events. The findings indicate that such linked occurrences may have been the norm, rather than a rare exception, over the last 2,500 years.</p>

          <p>Leading rugby nations, including England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia, have collectively announced that they will make players who join the proposed breakaway R360 league ineligible for international selection. The move is a major blow to the new globe-trotting competition, which had suggested its schedule would allow players to continue their Test careers. The national unions expressed concerns that the R360 model is designed for elite profit-making and could weaken the sport by neglecting player welfare and development pathways. This unified stance forces players to choose between lucrative contracts with the new league and the honor of representing their country.</p>

          <p>Two years after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, data illustrates the catastrophic toll on the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli strikes have killed or injured roughly 11% of the population, with over 67,000 Palestinians killed and nearly 170,000 wounded. Nearly the entire population is displaced, and infrastructure is decimated, with at least eight out of every ten buildings damaged or destroyed. The conflict has also created a severe humanitarian crisis, with widespread hunger and a collapsed healthcare system. The war began after a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel.</p>

          <p>Orlando Bravo, co-founder of private equity firm Thoma Bravo, has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently 'at a bubble,' drawing comparisons to the dot-com era. He cautioned that it is unsustainable to value a company with $50 million in recurring revenue at $10 billion, noting the immense challenge such a company would face to generate returns for investors. However, Bravo distinguished the current situation from the dot-com collapse by highlighting that today's AI boom is being financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets, providing a more stable foundation for the sector's activity.

          <p>A post on the Christian blog The Wartburg Watch played a key role in bringing to light decades-old abuse by Robert Preston Morris, the founder of Gateway Church. Morris recently pleaded guilty to five counts of lewd acts with a child, receiving a suspended sentence that includes six months in jail. The blog featured the story of survivor Cindy Clemishire, whose courage in coming forward sparked national media attention and led to Morris's resignation and criminal charges. The blog's editor, Dee Parsons, compared the unfolding abuse scandals in evangelical communities to the crisis the Catholic Church has faced, highlighting the role of independent media in uncovering hidden abuse.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of denying back pay to some furloughed federal workers once the government shutdown ends, a move that appears to contradict a 2019 law guaranteeing such compensation. President Trump stated that whether employees get paid 'depends on who we're talking about,' suggesting some 'don't deserve to be taken care of.' This position is based on a draft White House memo arguing that the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act requires new congressional action to appropriate back pay. The move is seen as a pressure tactic to compel Democrats to approve a funding bill without their requested policy additions.</p>

Organizers use the platform to hold votes on protest actions and share locations for demonstrations shortly before they begin. This digital-native approach allows the movement to maintain momentum while protecting the identities of its leaders from potential government reprisal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed a significant hike in tariffs on imported steel, a move that the UK steel industry warns could become 'perhaps the biggest crisis' it has ever faced. The plan would cut the tariff-free import quota by nearly half, after which a new 50% tariff would apply. As the EU is the UK's primary steel export market, worth nearly £3 billion annually, the measures could be devastating for British producers already in a precarious financial state. The EU's action is partly a response to global overcapacity and pressure from member states to protect their own industries from cheap imports.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Tuesday in a case challenging Colorado's ban on 'conversion therapy' for minors, with justices wrestling over whether the law regulates professional conduct or unconstitutionally restricts free speech. A Christian counselor, Kaley Chiles, argues the law censors her ability to have certain conversations with young patients about gender identity and sexual orientation. Colorado officials maintain the law is a reasonable regulation of a harmful and ineffective medical practice, consistent with the state's long-standing authority to oversee healthcare professions. The court's decision could have significant implications for how states regulate medical and mental health treatments performed through speech.</p>

This accusation comes amid ongoing conflict, including a recent Ukrainian drone strike that reportedly cut power in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region.

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing significant disruptions to air travel as staffing shortages among air traffic controllers lead to flight delays and cancellations nationwide. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed the issues to a 'slight tick-up in sick calls' from controllers concerned about working without pay, and warned the situation could worsen. On Monday, a dozen FAA facilities experienced shortages, impacting airports in major cities like Denver, Phoenix, and Newark. The disruptions highlight the fragility of the national aviation system, which has been dealing with long-standing controller shortages even before the shutdown added further strain.</p>

          <p>During a public parole hearing, David Norris, one of the men convicted of murdering Black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993, has for the first time admitted his involvement in the fatal racist attack. While accepting responsibility for his role, Norris refused to name the other individuals involved in the stabbing, citing risks to himself and his family. Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, argued that Norris remains a danger to the public and should not be released, pointing to his lack of full contrition and continued use of racist language in prison.
