          <h2>New Wearable Sensor Aims to Prevent Dehydration and Heatstroke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:17:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a non-invasive wearable sensor that monitors hydration levels in real time. The device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the arm to measure tissue hydration and transmitting the data to a smartphone. This technology could provide a simple and effective way for individuals, athletes, and patients with certain medical conditions to proactively manage their fluid intake and avoid health risks like heatstroke. The team is now working to refine the device into more comfortable formats like electronic tattoos.</p>

          <h2>India Shows Resilience Against England in Fourth Test</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:16:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India mounted a strong comeback against England, ending the fourth day at 174-2. After England posted a formidable total of 669, thanks to Ben Stokes' century, they quickly took two Indian wickets, putting the tourists in a precarious position. However, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill and KL Rahul has kept India's hopes of drawing the match alive. England remains the favorite to win and clinch the series, but India's determined resistance has created an intriguing final day.</p>

          <p>An initiative to create a safer environment for aid distribution in Gaza by holding a "women only" day ended in tragedy. Two women, including Mary Sheikh al-Eid, a mother of seven, were shot and killed while trying to get food in the southern Rafah area. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with pepper spray and stun grenades used on the crowd before gunfire erupted. This event highlights the extreme dangers Palestinians face when attempting to access humanitarian supplies, with the UN reporting over 1,000 have been killed near aid points since May.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that a grenade is missing from the site of a deadly explosion at a Los Angeles law enforcement training facility. The blast last Friday killed three veteran deputy sheriffs who were working on two "military-style" grenades that had been seized a day earlier. Officials believed the devices were inert after being X-rayed, but one detonated during disposal procedures. An extensive search for the second grenade has been unsuccessful, and an independent review of the arson and explosives team's policies has been ordered.</p>

Texas has already ended its policy following a federal lawsuit, and other states like Kentucky are facing similar pressure.

Drawing on past experiences in Iraq and Bosnia, he describes airdrops as a crude process that delivers very little aid, often inaccurately, and can even be dangerous to civilians on the ground. Bowen contends that only a full ceasefire and an unrestricted, long-term land-based aid operation can address the starvation.

          <p>Venezuelan men who were deported from the United States to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison are now alleging they endured "state-sanctioned torture." Following a prisoner swap deal, the men have been repatriated and are sharing their experiences, which include repeated beatings, humiliation by guards, and inhumane living conditions with dirty water and limited food. Lawyers for the men, some of whom were flagged as gang members by the U.S. without conviction, are calling for justice. Their testimonies provide the first detailed accounts from inside the controversial facility.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, a former major Republican benefactor, is publicly considering launching his own third party, a move that some Democrats believe could benefit them. Musk has called for primary challengers to certain Republicans and has promised to create a new party focused on fiscal responsibility. Polling suggests that a Musk-led "America Party" could draw significantly more support from Republican voters than from Democrats. While strategic hurdles remain, the prospect of Musk's resources funding spoiler candidates in key districts is seen as a potential vulnerability for the GOP.</p>

          <p>A recent Wall Street Journal poll indicates that the Democratic Party is facing a significant branding problem with voters. While President Trump and the GOP also have net unfavorability ratings, the Democratic Party's is considerably worse. On key issues like the economy, inflation, and tariffs, voters trust Republicans more than Democrats, despite disapproving of the administration's handling of those same issues. The only policy areas where Democrats hold an advantage are health care and vaccine policy. Despite this, in a generic congressional ballot, voters still narrowly favored a Democrat over a Republican.</p>

These substances, which do not break down in the environment, are linked to serious health issues including cancer, immune system effects, and fertility problems. Researchers from the University of Notre Dame found that while some products had low levels likely from packaging, others had levels so high that PFAS must have been intentionally used in manufacturing.
