          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated his regret for certain criticisms he made about President Donald Trump on social media, acknowledging that his posts "went too far." This follows a public disagreement between the two, sparked by Musk's description of Trump's tax bill as a "disgusting abomination." Trump responded by declaring an end to their relationship and expressing no interest in reconciliation. Musk's statement suggests a desire to de-escalate the tension between the two prominent figures, though the long-term impact on their relationship remains to be seen. Optimism is tempered by the potential for continued discord between these influential individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Montana Supreme Court has affirmed a lower court's decision that several state laws restricting abortion access are unconstitutional, including a ban beyond 20 weeks of gestation. This ruling reinforces the right to abortion in Montana, citing the state constitution's "right to be left alone," unaffected by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The challenged laws also included restrictions on telehealth prescriptions for abortion medication, a 24-hour waiting period, and mandatory ultrasound viewing options. The Montana Family Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the voter-approved initiative that enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution, arguing that voters who registered on Election Day were denied the chance to fully review the initiative.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly engaging with the private sector, as the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) consulted with tech industry leaders to gather input for Beijingâ€™s next five-year development blueprint. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of the NDRC, emphasized the crucial role private enterprises can play in technological innovation, considering them a "key force in developing new quality productive forces." This move signals a more private-sector-friendly approach from the Chinese government, aiming to leverage the innovation and vitality of private companies. The 15th Five-Year Plan is expected to prioritize technology and innovation as engines for development, suggesting a focus on future-oriented industries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a relatively low unemployment rate in the U.S., data indicates that finding a job has become increasingly difficult, with businesses hesitant to hire due to economic uncertainty. Economists point to declining job-finding and quits rates, along with a high share of long-term unemployed workers, as indicators of deeper issues within the labor market. The U-6 rate, which includes marginally attached workers and those employed part-time for economic reasons, remains high, suggesting that many Americans have stopped looking for work or are settling for part-time positions. The professional and business services sector, representing "white collar" jobs, has experienced a contraction, with fewer opportunities available compared to pre-pandemic levels.

          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of unrest as protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, resulting in multiple injuries and arrests. The violence was sparked by a peaceful protest following the court appearance of two teenage boys charged with sexual assault. Police have described the unrest as "racist thuggery," with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationality in response to the violence. Authorities are urging calm and have deployed additional resources to the area, while political figures have condemned the violence and called for reflection.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has indicated that a takeover offer for Commerzbank is currently unlikely due to the German bank's prohibitively expensive share price. Despite UniCredit's 28% stake in Commerzbank and authorization to hold up to 29.9%, Orcel stated that an acquisition at a premium would not be a valuable investment for UniCredit's shareholders. Commerzbank's shares have surged 76% year-to-date, fueled by a broader rally of German equities and Berlin's relaxed fiscal rules. Orcel emphasized that UniCredit is far from a merger bid and would first seek a "constructive solution" to opposition from the German government.</p>

Japan also aims to enhance collaboration with European nations supporting Ukraine, given Pyongyang's strengthening military ties with Moscow.

China's government-funded commercial imaging company, Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. (CGST), operates over 100 satellites and is positioning itself to collect intelligence at scale. This development raises concerns that authoritarian regimes are weaponizing commercial space faster than the U.S. is defending against it.

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 aims to consolidate the McKinney-Vento federal grant program, which supports homeless students, with 17 other programs and significantly cut funding. This consolidation would give districts greater "flexibility" but would eliminate the requirement to spend money on resources for homeless students. Advocates warn that schools may prioritize other needs, leading to a lack of support for students experiencing homelessness, who already face higher rates of absenteeism and are more likely to drop out. The proposal is awaiting approval from Congress, with some Democrats and Republicans urging support for the McKinney-Vento grant program.</p>

          <p>President Trump's legal team continues to appeal his criminal conviction for falsifying business records, arguing that the case should be moved to federal court. The appeal is based on the claim that prosecutors relied on evidence related to Trump's official acts as president. Legal scholars suggest this particular appeal, based on an antiquated law, is unlikely to succeed, but note that Trump's team is exhausting every possible argument. The Department of Justice has backed the president's effort to move the case to federal court, while the Manhattan District Attorney's office argues that such a move is not permissible after sentencing.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics indicates that states with permissive gun laws experienced a rise in pediatric firearm deaths between 2011 and 2023, while states with stricter laws did not. The research examined firearm deaths in children 17 and under following the 2010 Supreme Court case McDonald vs. Chicago, which led to varying changes in state gun laws. States with the most permissive gun laws had over 6,000 excess deaths compared to what was expected based on the prior decade. Experts emphasize the need to identify specific gun laws that effectively prevent gun deaths in children and teens, such as child access prevention laws.</p>

          <p>The bacteria salmonella, responsible for millions of infections annually, is named after Daniel E. Salmon, an American veterinary pathologist, though its discovery is credited to his assistant, Theobald Smith. The name was proposed by bacteriologist Joseph Leon LigniÃ¨res in 1900 to honor Salmon's contributions to the field. Salmonella has been infecting humans for centuries, with evidence suggesting its role in the collapse of the Aztec Empire. The article also references "Typhoid Mary", an asymptomatic carrier who unknowingly infected numerous families in the early 20th century, underscoring the complexities of public health and individual freedoms.</p>

Advocates of nuclear fusion believe it can play a key role in the energy transition, offering a virtually limitless source of clean, safe, and affordable energy.

The article points to a 1978 book, *Harvard Hates America*, and Project 2025's *Mandate for Leadership* as blueprints for the Republican attack on universities. The author argues that the actions are not about addressing antisemitism but rather part of a broader counter-revolution aimed at diminishing the influence of liberal arts colleges and universities. The analysis also suggests that the administration's actions are driven by profit and a desire to shift funding to trade schools.</p>

Asian economies, particularly those reliant on trade, seek to reduce reliance on the greenback to mitigate FX risks.
