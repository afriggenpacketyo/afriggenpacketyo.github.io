        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least two people were killed and others seriously injured in a combined vehicle and stabbing attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, UK. The incident occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, prompting a major police response. The suspected attacker was shot by armed officers and is believed to be deceased, though a bomb disposal unit was called to examine suspicious items on his person. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack and announced increased police presence at synagogues nationwide.</p>

A delivery driver recounted seeing what he first thought was a car crash before realizing a man had a knife and was trying to enter the synagogue. This witness and others described police arriving within seconds, issuing warnings to the suspect, and then opening fire when he did not comply. The attack, which took place on Yom Kippur in a prominent Jewish community, has left local residents shocked and horrified.</p>

          <p>Russia's finance ministry has proposed a draft budget that includes significant tax hikes to fund its ongoing war in Ukraine amidst a slowing economy. The plan involves raising the value-added tax (VAT) from 20% to 22% and increasing the tax burden on small businesses and gambling. Analysts suggest these measures effectively pass the financial cost of the war onto the Russian public as the Kremlin embraces austerity. The budget shows defense spending remaining near record highs while economic growth forecasts are being revised downward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation into the destructive Eaton fire in Los Angeles County reveals that local distribution lines malfunctioned hours before the main fire was believed to have started. Data shows multiple electrical faults occurred in the Altadena neighborhood, and firefighters were dispatched dozens of times for wire-related issues throughout the day. Despite these problems, utility company Southern California Edison did not shut off power to most circuits in the area. This finding challenges the primary narrative that only high-power transmission lines miles away were responsible for the blaze.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Kelsey Mitchell revealed she suffered from rhabdomyolysis, a serious medical condition, during a WNBA playoff game against the Las Vegas Aces. Mitchell described experiencing a terrifying "sense of numbness" where she briefly lost movement in her lower body, causing her to panic on the court. She was assisted by staff and taken to a hospital for what was initially reported as severe cramping. Mitchell has been a key player for the Fever, especially with other stars sidelined by injuries throughout the season.</p>

          <p>Todd Arrington, the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, has resigned following a dispute with the Trump administration over a gift for King Charles III. Sources indicate Arrington resisted a request to give an original sword from the library's collection to the monarch during a state visit. He argued against giving away a historical artifact belonging to the American people, offering instead to help find a replica. Ultimately, a replica was provided by West Point, but the disagreement reportedly led to Arrington's departure from his post.</p>

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study reveals that a rising number of working Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, making retirement savings an unattainable goal. The report found that 42% of Gen Z, millennial, and Gen X workers have no money left after covering basic living expenses, a significant increase from 31% in 1997. This financial pressure is attributed to the soaring costs of essentials like housing and healthcare, which consume a larger portion of income than in previous generations. The study suggests that simply telling workers to "save more" is unrealistic given the current economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey has intensified concerns about the Trump administration's weaponization of the Justice Department. Legal analysts note that the case appears to stem from personal animosity rather than strong legal merit, representing a significant departure from post-Watergate norms that sought to insulate the department from political influence. While institutional checks like grand juries have shown some resistance by rejecting certain charges, the administration's actions are testing the resilience of the justice system. The broader strategy appears to involve targeting a growing list of perceived enemies, using investigations as a tool of political pressure.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that the reported surge in cancer among adults under 50 may be partly a "diagnostic mirage." Researchers found that while diagnoses have nearly doubled since 1990, the rate of metastatic cancers and the overall death rate for the eight cancers studied have remained flat. This indicates that increased and improved screening methods may be detecting cancers that would not have become life-threatening. While some specific cancers like colorectal have seen genuine increases in mortality, the study complicates the narrative of a widespread epidemic of deadly disease among younger adults.</p>

          <p>Amid a severe housing crisis, Boston City Councilor Henry Santana is advocating for changes to the city's "outdated" zoning laws to facilitate the construction of more triple-decker homes. These three-family buildings were historically a key source of affordable housing for working families but are now difficult to build due to restrictions on building height. Santana's proposal aims to simplify the process, which currently requires expensive and lengthy zoning variances. Housing advocates support the idea, noting that increasing the housing supply is a critical strategy for improving affordability across the region.</p>

          <p>A cultural article delves into the debate over why certain pasta shapes, such as farfalle (bow ties) and penne, continue to be popular despite their functional flaws. Culinary experts argue that good pasta shapes excel at cooking evenly and holding sauce, qualities where shapes like farfalle, with its dense central knot, often fail. The persistence of these "bad" shapes is attributed to nostalgia and their common use in potluck dishes like pasta salad. While some chefs passionately dislike certain shapes, others argue that even a maligned pasta can find its purpose in the right dish, suggesting a matter of perspective.</p>

          <p>The US federal government has entered a shutdown after Congress failed to pass a new spending bill due to a dispute between Republicans and Democrats.

While essential services like border protection and air traffic control continue, workers are not being paid, and the shutdown could disrupt travel and delay economic data releases.</p>

          <p>Three individuals calling themselves the "Kingdom of Kubala" have been evicted by police from a camp they established on council-owned land near Jedburgh, Scotland. The group, who had gained a large online following, claimed they were reclaiming land stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago and did not recognize the authority of Scottish courts. The eviction followed a court order banning them from the land. Local officials expressed relief, stating the group's presence had put pressure on local businesses operating on the adjacent industrial estate.</p>

          <p>Josh Magennis, a 35-year-old striker, has been named in the Northern Ireland squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Slovakia and Germany. Magennis, who has 82 caps, had not been selected for the national team since November 2024. Manager Michael O'Neill was also able to recall several other players who were previously unavailable due to injury, including Dan Ballard and Conor Hazard. The return of these experienced players provides a boost to the squad following a mixed start to their qualifying campaign last month.</p>

          <p>The global airline industry is confronting a significant pilot shortage, driven by a combination of factors that threaten to disrupt air travel. During the pandemic, pilot training was halted and many senior pilots took early retirement, creating a backlog and a skills gap as travel demand now rebounds. Airlines are struggling to recruit new pilots, a process hampered by the high cost of training, which can exceed $100,000 in the US. In response, some airlines are increasing pay and bonuses, while others are lobbying to raise the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67.</p>

          <p>Recently released state report cards from the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce show significant disparities in the performance of Franklin County's 64 charter schools. Two schools, Franklin Learning Academy and Focus Learning Academy of Central Columbus, achieved the highest possible five-star rating, while three others received the lowest one-star rating. The ratings are based on six categories, including achievement, progress, and graduation rates. Education analysts noted that urban charter schools often perform well on the "progress" metric, which measures student growth over time, and urged parents to use the report cards as a tool.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the current government shutdown provides Democrats with significant bargaining leverage, which they should utilize to reverse damaging policies. The article posits that the shutdown is a direct consequence of Republicans passing their last major budget bill without any Democratic support, a bill that included deep cuts to healthcare programs. Now that Republicans need Democratic votes to fund the government, Democrats are justified in refusing unless those healthcare cuts are restored. The author contends that the Trump administration has effectively been "shutting down" disfavored parts of the government for months, making this official shutdown a crucial moment for opposition.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's continued poor performance has placed manager Ruben Amorim under intense pressure, with the club closer to the relegation zone than to the top of the table. Under Amorim, United have lost nearly twice as many Premier League matches as they have won, giving him the worst record of any manager in the post-Alex Ferguson era after 31 games. However, firing him would be a politically difficult move for the club's new leadership, as his appointment was a key decision of the new Ineos-led management. The manager's rigid adherence to his 3-4-3 formation is seen as a major issue among many other problems.</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown is directly impacting hundreds of thousands of federal employees and halting numerous public services. While "excepted" workers in roles deemed essential for safety, like TSA agents and military personnel, must continue to work without pay, many agencies have furloughed the majority of their staff. The EPA has been hit hardest with 89% of its staff furloughed, followed by the Departments of Education and Commerce. The shutdown also affects the housing market, as the Department of Housing and Urban Development has ceased most of its fair housing work, potentially delaying thousands of home closings.</p>

          <p>Nonprofits operating homeless shelters in Los Angeles are reporting that data from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is often inaccurate, making it difficult to know which shelters have open beds. For example, LAHSA data showed one shelter as nearly empty when it was almost full, a discrepancy that providers say undermines efforts to place people experiencing homelessness. This issue arises as LAHSA rolls out a new "real-time" system meant to streamline placements. The flawed data not only hinders operations but also risks giving the public a skewed view of shelter occupancy and resource management.</p>
