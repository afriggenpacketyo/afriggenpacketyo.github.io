          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has surged in the first half of 2025, reaching its highest volume since 2021. This revival is driven by Chinese companies seeking listings, supported by Beijing's regulatory tailwinds and concerns over potential U.S. delistings. Factors like improved market valuations, strong mainland investor inflows, and a focus on global expansion are fueling the city's potential return as the world's top IPO destination. The article notes this boom follows several years of lackluster activity, marking a significant turnaround in investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration executive order that suspended the ability of migrants to seek asylum at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating the White House cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system." The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed the decision for 14 days to allow for an appeal. Civil rights groups praised the ruling as a critical affirmation of laws passed by Congress.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The blasts, which occurred Tuesday evening, sparked a large fire that spread to 80 acres of grass and prompted a one-mile evacuation zone. Two individuals were treated for injuries, but the status of the seven missing people, including an 18-year-old on his first day of work, remains unknown. The company has an active license for fireworks importation and public displays, and Cal Fire is leading the investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell resign "immediately," escalating his criticism of the central bank's head. The call was made on Truth Social, where Trump linked to an article about a potential investigation into Powell. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has frequently attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to boost the economy. Powell recently suggested that rate cuts would have already occurred if not for the economic impact of the administration's tariff policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMICFRS) found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed due to heavily redacted evidence from the city council. Some documents provided to police had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value for major operations like Green Jacket and Bernese. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules to avoid jeopardizing prosecutions. While the report notes Greater Manchester Police has since improved its processes, the initial delays required investigators to restart their work on these sensitive cases.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that hormone therapy combining estrogen and progestin may increase breast cancer risk for women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women who have had a hysterectomy, appears to reduce the risk. This research refines understanding from earlier studies, emphasizing that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Health experts advise that while hormone therapy is effective for menopausal symptoms, women should discuss their personal health history and these findings with their doctor.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, has pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, admitting his guilt in court as part of a plea deal. The agreement spares him from the death penalty, and he is expected to receive multiple life sentences without parole. The brutal stabbings of Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogen in their off-campus home had drawn intense national interest. The plea deal has divided the victims' families, with some expressing relief and closure while others felt "let down" by the state.</p>

Investigators also used cell phone data and surveillance footage placing his car near the crime scene multiple times.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that while a slight majority of Latinos voted for Kamala Harris in 2024, Donald Trump gained a significantly larger share of their vote, at 48%, compared to 2020. Political experts suggest this shift is not necessarily ideological but reflects a move toward populism driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic party. Some analysts point to backlash against progressive border policies among naturalized citizens and a feeling that Democrats have neglected a working-class agenda. The results underscore the complexity of the Latino electorate, which is often misunderstood by both major political parties.</p>

          <p>The endangered Southern Resident killer whale population in Washington's Puget Sound, now down to just 73 individuals, faces a severe threat from a crashing Chinook salmon population. Conservationists attribute the salmon's decline to habitat destruction, a problem they fear will worsen under a proposed Trump administration rule change. The proposal would alter the Endangered Species Act's definition of "harm" to exclude habitat damage, potentially opening protected areas to industrial development. This could jeopardize recovery efforts for both the orcas and the salmon they depend on for survival.</p>

An investigation revealed police used sting operations, including placing an undercover officer in Monica's cell and recording the couple in adjoining holding cells, to capture their interactions. Intercepted letters and recorded calls allegedly show the lovers using coded language like "Ride or Die" and discussing marriage, which prosecutors argue proves an ongoing commitment to their secrecy pact.

          <p>The Trump administration's massive tax and spending bill is facing significant hurdles in the House of Representatives due to deep divisions within the Republican party. After narrowly passing the Senate, the bill's progress has stalled as factions like the conservative House Freedom Caucus raise alarms over its potential to increase the national deficit. Other moderate Republicans are concerned about steep cuts to social programs like Medicaid, fearing harm to their constituents. With a slim majority, Speaker Mike Johnson is struggling to unify his party to meet the president's July 4th deadline for the legislation.</p>

          <p>On January 23, 2017, beauty executive Fabio Sementilli was murdered in what appeared to be a robbery, but investigators soon focused on his wife, Monica, and her lover, Robert Baker. Prosecutors allege Monica created an alibi by going to Target while remotely monitoring home security cameras, allowing Baker and an accomplice to enter and kill her husband. Key evidence includes security footage of hooded figures near the home, Baker's DNA found at the scene, and phone records showing extensive communication between the lovers. After Fabio's death, Monica and Baker allegedly continued their secret romance before being arrested.</p>

The verdict provides a sense of relief and validation for Erin Smith, who has become a prominent advocate for police mental health.

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials is warning that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in fiscal year 2026 could have severe public health consequences. The proposal would slash the CDC's budget by over half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. This would devastate funding for state and local health departments and cripple programs for chronic disease prevention, including those for HIV and tobacco use. The officials argue that these cuts would leave Americans sicker and could lead to unnecessary deaths across the country.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon believes that recent U.S. strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities have delayed its program by approximately one to two years, according to a defense department spokesperson. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's claim that the sites were "obliterated." The analysis is reportedly based on intelligence suggesting key centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site were destroyed. The extent of the setback remains a point of debate, with the UN's nuclear watchdog suggesting Iran could resume enrichment within months, while Iran has suspended cooperation with inspectors.</p>

With the Autumn Budget approaching, her options are limited by a pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance, or VAT for working people. Potential paths include waiting for unexpected economic growth, implementing further unpopular spending cuts, or extending the current freeze on tax thresholds, which acts as a stealth tax.
