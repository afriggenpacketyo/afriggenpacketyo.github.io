          <p>In Athol, Idaho, former state trooper Dan Howard called 911, reporting his wife Kendy Howard had shot herself in the bathtub in February 2021. First responders noticed inconsistencies at the scene, including broken glass, wet towels, and Kendy's clothing strewn about, leading them to suspect foul play. Kootenai County Sheriff's Detective Jerry Northrup found that the dryer, containing clean towels, had been started just a minute before the 911 call, which raised suspicions. After further investigation and consultation with experts, Dan Howard was arrested in April 2023 and went on trial in March 2024 for his wife's murder, with the case being investigated by "48 Hours."</p>

          <p>Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, was found guilty of second-degree murder and domestic battery for the death of his wife, Kendy Howard, who was initially believed to have committed suicide in February 2021. Kendy had told Dan she wanted a divorce just days before her death. Investigators became suspicious due to evidence at the scene, including a running dryer and a packed duffel bag. Dan was sentenced to life in prison without parole in May 2024, with the judge citing his pride, greed, and anger as motives for the crime, according to reporting by "48 Hours."</p>

          <p>The recent panic over baby food pouches, deemed ultra-processed foods (UPFs), is seen as another way to make mothers feel guilty, according to Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett. While acknowledging concerns about sugar content and nutritional value, Cosslett argues that this criticism is part of a larger trend of shaming mothers for seeking convenience and not adhering to traditional domestic roles. She asserts that societal factors like lack of time, resources, and support systems are often ignored in the UPF debate, placing undue pressure on mothers to cook everything from scratch.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift from a coalition government to a royal court, where loyalists and enforcers are prized over skeptics and inhibitors. The choice of Vance, who embraced Trump's MAGA agenda without reservation, indicated a second term characterized by ferocity and recklessness, devoid of the guardrails that tempered Trump's first administration. This structural change, Klein asserts, has led to a presidency where Trump faces little resistance and is surrounded by yes men.</p>
