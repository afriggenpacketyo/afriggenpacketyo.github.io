          <h2>Expert Recommends Teaching Children 'Self-Connection' as a Crucial Life Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that the most critical skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. This skill fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which are vital for long-term mental health and success. The article suggests practical methods for parents, such as validating feelings instead of dismissing them, allowing for messy emotions, and modeling self-awareness. These small shifts in interaction can help a child build a strong inner voice and sense of self-worth.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, outlines the precarious situation for American businesses operating in China amid ongoing trade tensions. He suggests that the current 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, as a return to high tariffs is undesirable for both nations. While China has made concessions regarding fentanyl precursors, the US has yet to reciprocate by lowering its own tariffs, creating uncertainty. The business community remains concerned that the bilateral discussions are overly focused on tariffs rather than broader, more stable trade relationship issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Legal Expert Explains Future of 9/11 Trials Following Canceled Plea Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:57:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the cancellation of plea deals for the defendants in the Guantanamo Bay 9/11 cases, the path forward for the military tribunals is uncertain. Georgetown University Law professor Stephen Vladeck analyzes the current situation, discussing the legal and procedural complexities that now arise. The collapse of the plea agreements, which were years in the making, reopens questions about how justice will be pursued for the perpetrators of the attacks. This development prolongs a legal process that has been fraught with delays and controversy for over two decades.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in a tragic accident at a Long Island medical facility after being forcefully pulled into a running MRI machine. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the imaging room. The powerful magnetic field of the machine drew him in, causing a fatal medical episode. The incident highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines, which strictly prohibit metallic objects due to their strong magnetic forces. An investigation into the circumstances of the accident is underway.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, a significant political blow. The defeat is attributed to public dissatisfaction with inflation, scandals, and a surge in anti-immigration sentiment, which has fueled the rise of the right-wing populist Sanseito party. Despite the loss, which historically leads to resignation, Ishiba has pledged to stay in power to navigate critical trade negotiations with the United States. This result leaves his coalition in the minority in both houses of parliament for the first time since 1955.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China had some successes, his administration's subsequent actions risk sabotaging improved relations. The article notes that Australian media and opposition figures have framed the visit with suspicion, suggesting China aims to divide Australia from the US. More pointedly, the author criticizes Albanese's defiant stance on the potential sale of the Port of Darwin, which is leased by a Chinese company, as a self-inflicted wound. This move undermines his own efforts to present Australia as a reliable destination for Chinese investment.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas have significantly lowered the number of people listed as missing after the catastrophic flash floods on July 4, from 160 down to just three. The floods killed 135 people, including many children at a summer camp along the Guadalupe River. Kerrville city officials reported that "countless hours" of investigative work by thousands of federal, state, and local personnel led to locating and verifying the safety of most of those who were unaccounted for. While a relief for many, search efforts will persist for the remaining missing individuals.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that August 1 is a "hard deadline" for new US tariffs to take effect on imported goods. While he noted that negotiations with trading partners can continue after this date, countries will begin paying the new rates from that day forward. Lutnick clarified that many smaller nations will likely face a baseline tariff of 10%, while larger economies will either have to open their markets to US goods or pay a higher tariff. This confirmation solidifies the timeline for President Trump's aggressive trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>
