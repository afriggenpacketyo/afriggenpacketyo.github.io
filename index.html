            <p>Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, speaking at a commemoration of the Battle of Concord, emphasized the need to continue fighting for liberty, citing contemporary threats to freedoms. She drew parallels between current challenges and those faced by Revolutionary War predecessors, including the silencing of critics and demands for unquestioning loyalty. Representative Lori Trahan echoed these sentiments, stressing that the threat to democracy often comes from within. The ceremony included a wreath-laying to honor both Minutemen and British soldiers who died in the battle, followed by a musket salute.</p>

The problem extends to the private sector, where customer service is often outsourced or delegated to websites, leading to further dissatisfaction when complex issues arise.</p>
