          <p>The article discusses the potential benefits of investing in a $200,000 annuity for retirement, emphasizing its role in providing a steady income stream amid economic uncertainty. It highlights that while a $200,000 annuity may not cover all retirement expenses, it can supplement Social Security payments and other income sources. The monthly payouts vary based on factors such as age, gender, and contract terms, with examples provided for different age groups. The article also considers whether an annuity is a worthwhile investment, weighing the benefits of guaranteed income and peace of mind against the drawbacks of limited liquidity and potential for higher returns through other investments.

          <p>Michelle Goldberg's opinion piece in the New York Times criticizes Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its impact on the United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.). Musk's plan to cut government waste is described as a failure, with experts suggesting that any savings were negligible and potentially offset by the costs of DOGE's actions. The article alleges that the decimation of U.S.A.I.D. has led to the termination of grants, resulting in an estimated 300,000 deaths, primarily among children, with the situation worsening in areas like East Africa where access to antiretroviral medication and food aid has been severely reduced. The White House denies these fatal consequences, but field reports contradict this denial, revealing increased suffering and malnutrition. </p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former president of Sinn Fein, won a libel case against the BBC over a documentary that claimed he sanctioned the 2006 murder of a British spy. The jury decided that the BBC had defamed Adams in a 2016 episode of the BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight documentary series and in an accompanying online story. Adams has always denied being a member of the IRA militant group, and the jury rejected the BBC's defense that its journalism was fair, responsible, and in the public interest. Adams stated the case was about "putting manners on the BBC" and that the BBC "upholds the ethos of the British state in Ireland."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the majority for allowing the government to disrupt the lives of these immigrants before the courts reach a final decision. The Department of Homeland Security stated it can now begin removing migrants under the CHNV parole programs as the case progresses. The ruling comes shortly after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the status of nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S. under the Temporary Status Program.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares are set to finish May with a strong performance, despite recent challenges in car sales in China and Europe. This rally coincides with Elon Musk's departure from his role as a "special government employee" at the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk has stated that he will dedicate more time to his businesses, though he plans to continue spending some time on government work. The stock's increase reflects investor confidence in Tesla as Musk refocuses on the company.</p>

The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would limit repayment options to a fixed-payment plan or an income-driven repayment plan (IDR) with loan forgiveness after three decades. While supporters argue that the plan would ensure borrowers eventually pay off their balances, critics express concerns about the long-term financial burden on borrowers.

          <h2>US Regulator Dismisses Suit Against Binance in Crypto-Friendly Move</h2>

          <p>The US has voluntarily dismissed its civil lawsuit against Binance, the worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency exchange, in a move that extends the Trump administration's friendly approach to cryptocurrencies. The SEC's decision to dismiss the enforcement case was appropriate "in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter". Trump has launched a cryptocurrency and hosted a dinner for the coinâ€™s top holders. The SEC has since withdrawn or put on hold many cryptocurrency enforcement cases.</p>
