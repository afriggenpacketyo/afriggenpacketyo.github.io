          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, a key justification for deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime does not direct their actions in the United States. This release undermines the administration's rationale for the deportations and calls into question its criticism of media coverage on the issue.
