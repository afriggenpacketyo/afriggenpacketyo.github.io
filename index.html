          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic. Current forecasts predict it will remain over open water for several days, tracking north of the Caribbean and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system is expected to intensify, potentially becoming a low-grade hurricane by the weekend as it moves westward. While no immediate land threats have been issued, meteorologists note that Bermuda could be in its path next week as it continues to strengthen.</p>

          <p>Frank Somerville, a 67-year-old former news anchor for KTVU in Oakland, was arrested on suspicion of assault with serious bodily injury following a physical altercation with his adult daughter. In a since-deleted social media post, Somerville claimed the fight occurred after his daughter, allegedly experiencing marijuana withdrawal, demanded money and refused to leave his home. This incident marks Somerville’s fourth arrest in four years, following previous DUI charges and another altercation in 2023. His attorney described the situation as a delicate family matter that they hope to resolve out of court.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, was reportedly fearful of being shot by law enforcement and did not want a SWAT raid on his family's home. According to the Washington County Sheriff, Robinson's family and a retired detective helped facilitate a peaceful surrender after he was identified from news reports. The sheriff detailed how Robinson was brought to the sheriff's office unrestrained, where he was described as quiet and sober while awaiting investigators. Authorities are now seeking the death penalty for Robinson, who faces multiple charges including aggravated murder.</p>

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Found to Consume Alcohol Equivalent of Two Daily Cocktails from Fermented Fruit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fruit with a low alcohol content, amounting to a daily intake equivalent to nearly two human cocktails. Scientists measured the ethanol in figs and plum-like fruits, finding it averaged around 0.3% by weight. While this steady, low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits that wild chimps are known to eat.</p>

The report emphasizes that EHCPs and tribunals serve as a crucial "backstop of accountability" for parents navigating a system that has been described as financially unsustainable.

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California's poverty rate is tied with Louisiana's as the highest in the nation, with 17.7% of residents unable to meet basic needs. The rate has shown little improvement since surging after the expiration of pandemic-era aid policies, which had brought it to a historic low in 2021. The report highlights that child poverty has more than doubled since 2021 and that people of color and renters are disproportionately affected. The authors attribute the sustained high poverty to policy choices, warning that recent state and federal budget cuts could worsen the situation.</p>

The dispute stems from state efforts to fund affordable housing near recent burn scars, which prompted local officials to enact limits on new development to address residents' concerns.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move seen as a middle path between stimulating a weakening job market and controlling inflation. The decision comes amidst an unprecedented pressure campaign from President Trump, who has publicly attacked the central bank's independence and sought to remove a board member. The appointment of Trump administration official Stephen Miran to the Fed board, who cast the lone dissenting vote for a larger cut, has further fueled concerns about political influence. While this modest cut signals the Fed is still acting independently, the ongoing conflict tests the institution's long-standing autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The turmoil in UCLA's football program has continued with the departure of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe, who mutually agreed to part ways with the team. The move comes just days after head coach DeShaun Foster was dismissed following the team's 0-3 start to the season. Interim coach Tim Skipper announced the change, noting that Malloe, a respected and popular figure among players, felt a heavy sense of responsibility for the team's struggles. Despite the coaching upheaval, Skipper reported that no players had immediately entered the transfer portal, and the team is focused on resetting for its upcoming conference games.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the recently fired director of the CDC, testified before a Senate committee that she was dismissed for refusing to comply with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda. Monarez alleged that Kennedy demanded "blanket approval" for all recommendations from a new vaccine advisory panel he had stacked with skeptics, without her seeing the scientific evidence. She also claimed he ordered her to fire career officials responsible for vaccine policy without cause. Monarez stated she refused because it violated her scientific integrity, fearing it would reduce access to life-saving vaccines for children.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to increase its contract with the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to nearly $5 million, despite previous outrage over the firm's high billing rates. The firm, which is representing the city in a major homelessness lawsuit, had previously submitted an invoice for $1.8 million for just two weeks of work, with some attorneys billing at nearly $1,300 per hour. Despite some council members voting against the increase due to the cost, the majority approved the additional funds, arguing the firm's legal work was essential to protect the city's control over its homelessness programs.</p>

          <p>David Pittman, 63, was executed by lethal injection in Florida for the 1990 murders of his estranged wife's parents and sister, whose house he then set on fire. This marks the 12th execution in the state in 2025, a record number since the death penalty was reinstated, with Governor Ron DeSantis having signed more death warrants this year than any predecessor. Pittman's final appeals, which argued he had an intellectual disability that should have made him ineligible for execution, were rejected by the courts. In his final words, Pittman maintained his innocence, stating he was being murdered by the state.</p>

While saying managers should not react in such a way, he also called for action against fans who insult coaches throughout a match.

Lula criticized Trump's recent imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as "eminently political" and said he learned about them through the media rather than diplomatic channels. He contrasted this with his relationships with other world leaders, stating that Trump "never wanted to have a conversation" and that his administration's relationship is with former president Jair Bolsonaro, not with Brazil itself.</p>

          <p>Birdie G’s, the celebrated Santa Monica restaurant from chef-owner Jeremy Fox, is set to close in December after five years in business. Fox cited a combination of factors for the closure, including the restaurant's large size, its location in the still-developing Bergamot Station complex, and sustained economic pressures from the pandemic, inflation, and industry strikes. A significant drop in business following the Palisades fire in January was described as the "nail in the coffin." The restaurant, known for its creative blend of Midwestern, Jewish, and Californian cuisine, had received numerous accolades, including a spot on the L.A. Times 101 list.</p>

          <p>Nexstar, the largest broadcast station group in the U.S., announced it would indefinitely preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' on its ABC-affiliated stations. The decision, which was followed by ABC pulling the show entirely, came after Kimmel made controversial comments linking the man accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The move is particularly notable as Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for a major merger with Tegna. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, had publicly condemned Kimmel's remarks and suggested the agency could take action against ABC's broadcast license.</p>

He argued that Israel has waged an "all-out war against the entire Palestinian people" and called for an end to U.S. complicity and military aid to the Israeli government.
