          <p>A man is in custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people in what authorities are calling a random attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The incident occurred near the checkout area, and the 42-year-old suspect reportedly used a folding knife. Citizens on the scene assisted in apprehending the suspect and providing first aid to the victims before first responders arrived. Four of the wounded remain in serious condition, though the local hospital has reported encouraging signs of recovery.</p>

          <p>A protest on the Greek island of Syros successfully prevented an Israeli cruise ship from docking, igniting a fierce debate across Greece about antisemitism and free speech. Around 300 demonstrators carrying Palestinian flags gathered to protest Israel's actions in Gaza, leading the cruise line to bypass the port. The incident has divided public opinion and politicians, highlighting the complex political alignments within Greece regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The article notes that while the government is staunchly pro-Israel, public sentiment has shifted.</p>

          <p>One year after Venezuela's disputed presidential election, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has strongly condemned President Nicolás Maduro, labeling him the leader of a narco-terrorist organization. Rubio's statement aligns with escalating pressure from the Trump administration, which recently sanctioned the Cartel de los Soles, an entity the U.S. alleges is headed by Maduro. The Justice Department indicted Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in 2020, and the U.S. does not recognize the legitimacy of his presidency or the 2024 election results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Malaysia for talks aimed at ending a deadly border dispute that has killed at least 34 people and displaced over 168,000. The diplomatic effort follows pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who spoke with both leaders and urged a ceasefire. Despite the agreement to negotiate, fighting continued over the weekend, with both nations blaming each other for renewed shelling and troop movements along the contested frontier, a source of tension for decades.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company a year ago. Investor confidence is growing, with the company's stock up over 30% this year as aircraft production and delivery numbers improve. Despite a major setback with a 737 Max door-plug blowout in January, Ortberg's hands-on approach has earned praise from airline customers for improving quality and predictability. Analysts expect the manufacturer to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aborted its takeoff at Denver International Airport due to what the FAA described as a "possible landing gear incident." Passengers were evacuated via emergency slides after signs of a fire were observed under the aircraft. One person was transported to the hospital with a minor injury, but all other customers and crew deplaned safely. A 17-year-old passenger described intense shaking and tilting before the plane came to an abrupt halt on the runway.</p>

          <p>Top trade officials from the European Union and the United States have convened at Donald Trump's Scottish golf resort for critical negotiations aimed at averting a trade war. The EU delegation, led by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, hopes to secure a framework deal to prevent Trump's threatened 30% tariffs on all EU imports. An agreement in principle is believed to center on a baseline tariff of 15%, a painful compromise for the EU but one that would restore stability for global investors and key industries like European car manufacturing.

          <p>Drivers in Bogotá, Colombia, are being targeted by a frustrating scam perpetrated by criminals known as "pinchallantas," or "tire-puncturers." These individuals ride motorcycles and strategically drop sharp objects on the road to damage car tires. They then approach the stranded motorists and guide them to nearby mechanics who are in on the scheme. These complicit repair shops allegedly inflict further damage on the tires and then overcharge for the repairs, exploiting the drivers' desire for a quick fix.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is using a new tactic to highlight the impact of Republican healthcare policy, erecting billboards near struggling rural hospitals that read, "If this hospital closes, blame Trump." The campaign targets states like Missouri, Oklahoma, and Montana, linking potential closures to the massive cuts to Medicaid included in Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." With over 150 rural hospitals having already closed since 2010, Democrats aim to hold Trump responsible for policies expected to exacerbate the financial strain on rural healthcare systems.</p>

          <p>Oakland's Chinatown, one of the oldest in the U.S., is facing a new economic challenge after surviving the pandemic and a wave of anti-Asian violence. Merchants in the vibrant district report that tariffs on Chinese goods are driving up their costs and causing a noticeable drop in customer spending. While the area remains a popular destination, shopkeepers note that sales of imported items like specialty foods and furniture have declined. For example, one supermarket owner stated that costs have risen by an average of 50% due to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Atlantic posits that Donald Trump's presidency is inadvertently making socialism attractive to a new generation of Americans. It argues that his administration's cronyism, blatant self-enrichment, and attacks on free trade have discredited market economics in the eyes of many. By embodying a form of "ersatz capitalism" that favors insiders and vilifies global cooperation, Trump's actions and rhetoric validate the sharpest critiques of the system. This disillusionment, the article suggests, is creating an opening for socialist ideas that once seemed relegated to the past. (not investment advice)</p>
