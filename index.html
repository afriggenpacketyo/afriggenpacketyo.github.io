          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 51-49 to advance a sweeping Republican tax and spending package, a key legislative priority for President Trump's second term. The vote, which was held open for hours as leaders sought to secure support, saw two Republicans join all Democrats in opposition. The bill proposes significant tax cuts, funding for immigration and defense, and reductions in spending for programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Despite clearing this procedural hurdle, the bill's final passage remains uncertain due to lingering disputes among Republicans over its contents and fiscal impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A jury has found Samuel Woodward guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of his former classmate, Blaze Bernstein. Bernstein, who was 19, gay, and Jewish, was stabbed to death in a California park. The prosecution successfully argued that Woodward, who was linked to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, was motivated by hate. The defense claimed Woodward was provoked, but the jury's verdict means he now faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, bringing a long-awaited conclusion to a case delayed for over six years.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage healthier food choices among consumers. The voluntary plan aims to tackle rising obesity rates by having retailers promote healthier options through discounts, loyalty point incentives, or revised store layouts. While the initiative does not impose specific targets, it requires major food businesses to report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. Critics note that the success of previous voluntary programs has been mixed and that the higher cost of healthy food remains a significant barrier for many families.</p>

          <p>The most-watched season of Love Island USA has sparked intense cyberbullying against its contestants, prompting the show to issue a public plea for kindness. This situation mirrors the tragic history of the UK version, where two former contestants died by suicide, leading to a government inquiry into reality television's duty of care. While producers state they have enhanced mental health support, experts argue that the US franchise may lag behind the UK in welfare measures. The core conflict remains between producing dramatic television and protecting the well-being of participants who face the immense pressures of overnight fame and public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a strong warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric aimed at judges by politicians from both parties. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts expressed concern that such attacks could incite violence, referencing serious threats made against judges for simply performing their duties. Without naming individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to respond to criticism from both President Trump and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. Roberts emphasized that the judicial system has an established appellate process for disagreeing with decisions, and impeachment or threats are inappropriate and dangerous responses.</p>

This renews a conflict between Musk and the Trump administration, which had previously escalated to threats of cutting federal subsidies to Musk's companies.

          <p>Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters clashed with police in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. The demonstration, one of the largest in recent months, saw riot police use tear gas and stun grenades, resulting in dozens of arrests. The protests, led by students, have been ongoing for months, fueled by accusations of government corruption and ties to organized crime, particularly after a deadly railway station roof collapse. President Vucic has condemned the protests as a foreign-backed plot and has so far refused calls for a snap election.</p>

          <h2>The Urban Heat Island Effect: Why Cities Experience Higher Temperatures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. This occurs because dark surfaces like asphalt and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, releasing it slowly as heat, especially at night. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water provide natural cooling through evaporation. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, urban populations are particularly vulnerable, facing temperatures that can be up to 10Â°C warmer than nearby countryside, which exacerbates health risks like dehydration and heat stroke.</p>

The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates students on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen correctly. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, health organizations behind the project hope that instilling these habits early will empower the next generation to protect themselves from harmful UV exposure.</p>

Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, addressed the crowd, celebrating the peaceful defiance against a "puffed-up and hateful power."

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $5 increase for general admission tickets to the L.A. Zoo, set to take effect on July 1. The price hike is part of the city's effort to address a budget crisis, with the new rates being $27 for adults and $22 for children. The decision follows a proposed budget that included significant staffing reductions at the zoo, which its director warned would harm the visitor experience. While the increase aims to generate more revenue, it remains considerably lower than admission prices at other major California zoos, such as the San Diego Zoo.</p>

          <p>Following its recent 12-day war with Israel, Iran has deepened its domestic crackdown, executing several men on espionage charges and arresting hundreds accused of having ties to Israel. Human rights activists express grave concern, stating that those executed were denied due process and that the regime is using the post-war climate to instill fear and suppress dissent. The government has also announced new surveillance measures to monitor citizens' online activities. Many Iranians fear this period of heightened repression, viewing it as a form of collective punishment by a regime seeking to reassert control after the conflict.</p>
