          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to withhold federal grant money from over 30 cities and counties designated as "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The ruling protects hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants that the administration sought to deny due to these cities' policies of not fully cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. This decision is part of a larger legal battle, as the Department of Justice has also challenged sanctuary policies in various states and cities, particularly those limiting immigration officials' access to courthouses. The legal fight underscores the ongoing tension between federal immigration priorities and local law enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Newly released transcripts from a prison interview reveal Ghislaine Maxwell, associate of Jeffrey Epstein, told US officials she never witnessed inappropriate behavior from Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. Maxwell also claimed that the widely discussed Epstein "client list" does not exist and called allegations against Prince Andrew "mind-blowingly not conceivable," asserting a famous photo of him with Virginia Giuffre is fake. Currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, Maxwell is seeking a presidential pardon, though the White House has stated no leniency is being considered. The 300-page transcript sheds light on her perspective regarding numerous high-profile individuals connected to Epstein.</p>

          <p>Despite not being its newest or most powerful weapon, China's DF-31 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remains a crucial component of its national defense strategy. A recent full-range test, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated the missile's capability to reach the US mainland, reinforcing China's second-strike nuclear capability. This successful launch sends a significant geopolitical message to the United States and its allies, highlighting the PLA Rocket Force's ability to maintain a credible nuclear counterstrike force. The continued effectiveness of the DF-31 series underscores China's long-term strategic military planning and its role in global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted again on Hawaii's Big Island, sending fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air. The eruption, which began Friday morning, is contained within the summit crater and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular and safe viewing opportunity for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This marks the 31st eruptive episode since December, part of an ongoing pattern where magma accumulates and is forcefully released. Scientists continue to monitor the volcano's activity, which provides valuable data and aligns with Native Hawaiian traditions viewing the lava as the work of the goddess Pele.</p>

The announcement has intensified international pressure on Israel to halt its offensive and allow more humanitarian aid into the besieged territory, where nearly a quarter of the population faces catastrophic hunger.

The legislation, which aims to redraw the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, was a key priority for Republicans and was encouraged by former President Trump ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The bill's passage follows a weeks-long standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. Democrats have condemned the new map, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation, and they have vowed to challenge its legality in court.</p>

Parole commissioners cited the brothers' behavior while incarcerated, rather than the killings themselves, as the primary reason for the denials. Erik Menendez, 54, was noted for institutional misconduct including fights, drug use, and possessing contraband like a mobile phone. Similarly, Lyle Menendez, 57, was described as struggling with "anti-social personality traits like deception, minimisation and rule breaking," despite expressing remorse. The hearings provided new details about their lives in prison and underscored the parole boards' focus on rehabilitation and adherence to rules.</p>

          <p>Some businesses across the U.S. are bringing back "recession specials," a marketing tactic popularized during the Great Recession, in response to deteriorating consumer sentiment. Establishments from New York coffee shops to San Francisco burger chains are offering discounted deals and themed events that explicitly reference a potential economic downturn. This trend reflects broader public anxiety, as evidenced by the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which has fallen due to concerns over trade policy and inflation. The re-emergence of recession-themed marketing suggests that businesses are sensing a pullback in consumer spending and are adjusting their strategies to appeal to budget-conscious customers.

Some residents are moving to inland, purpose-built towns like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with storm-proof features like impact-resistant windows, native landscaping for water absorption, and robust infrastructure that withstood a direct hit from Hurricane Ian. In other areas, like Miami's Coconut Grove, city programs and nonprofits are helping low-income residents rebuild their homes at higher elevations and with stronger materials.

Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that safeguards the club's future and allows for investment in facilities and the fan experience. The move provides long-term stability for the Championship club, ending years of uncertainty for supporters who have seen the team play at four different grounds under various owners since leaving Highfield Road in 2005. The purchase marks a new era of ambition for the club, which can now finally call the stadium its own.</p>

          <p>Public schools across El Salvador are now enforcing strict new disciplinary rules, including mandatory military-style haircuts for boys and perfectly tidy uniforms.

The government defends the measures as necessary for restoring order, while some teachers' unions have condemned them as the "militarization of education." The move is part of President Bukele's broader authoritarian approach, which is popular for its success in reducing gang violence but has drawn criticism for eroding civil liberties and democratic norms.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), which he called "OUT OF CONTROL" for its focus on slavery, reflect a historical pattern of minimizing the institution's role in U.S. history. The article argues that this rhetoric is a modern version of the "Lost Cause" myth, a century-old campaign by groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy to rebrand the Confederacy and portray slavery as benevolent. By demanding museums talk more about how "HOTTEST" the country is, the administration is attempting to politicize cultural institutions and impose an ideological narrative that downplays the horrors and legacy of chattel slavery.</p>

Critics raise concerns about the lack of oversight, harsh conditions, and limited access to legal services, calling the use of a military base for mass detention a "shameful" misuse of resources and a threat to due process.</p>

Many people who retire early do so for unplanned reasons like health or employment issues, rather than financial stability.

          <p>Dermatologists are highlighting a key benefit of tinted sunscreens: they protect against visible light, which standard sunscreens do not. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, the same pigment that gives the products their color. While regular sunscreens focus on blocking UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, the addition of iron oxide in tinted formulas provides a more comprehensive defense against light-induced skin damage, addressing cosmetic concerns that can have a significant psychosocial impact.</p>
