          <p>India conducted strikes on Pakistan, targeting what it called "terror camps," escalating the conflict between the two nuclear powers following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan responded, claiming at least eight people were killed and asserting its right to retaliate, raising concerns of further escalation. Global leaders, including President Trump and the U.N. Secretary-General, called for restraint and de-escalation, highlighting the potentially dire consequences of a military confrontation. The strikes mark a significant intensification of the long-standing conflict over Kashmir, a region both countries claim, with India crossing thresholds by striking a large number of sites and targeting the Pakistani heartland in Punjab.</p>

          <p>China plans to release a movie this summer about the Imperial Japanese Army's Unit 731, a notorious unit believed to have conducted covert biological and chemical warfare research in China during World War II. The film, produced in cooperation with an exhibition hall dedicated to the unit, is set to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese conflict. Film director Zhao Linshan aims to evoke sympathy and highlight the unit's cruel history, while a Japanese government source expressed concern that the film could rekindle historical tensions and negatively impact bilateral relations. The Japanese government maintains that it has not confirmed evidence to indicate the unit's human experiments.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid trade worries. The measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care. These moves signal a greater urgency to stabilize the economy and alleviate depreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan, but some analysts suggest their impact on domestic credit demand may be limited. The government is also preparing additional measures to support small and medium enterprises and the private sector.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to eliminate $1.15 billion in debt and focus on its transition into a telehealth services provider. The company, supported by nearly three-quarters of its debt holders, expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 45 days. This move comes as WeightWatchers shifts its focus to the prescription drug weight loss business, including the acquisition of Sequence, now WeightWatchers Clinic, a telehealth service for weight-loss medications. Despite a decline in overall revenue, the company's clinical subscription revenue has seen significant growth, indicating a shift in the weight loss market.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, prosecutors played a series of voicemails Read allegedly left for her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, on the night he died, revealing her anger and frustration. The voicemails, which include expletives and accusations, were left before O'Keefe was found unresponsive outside a home, where prosecutors allege Read struck him with her SUV and left him to die. Defense attorneys argue the voicemails portray Read as a hysterical girlfriend unaware of O'Keefe's death, while prosecutors suggest they were a calculated attempt to cover her tracks. The trial also featured testimony about the handling of evidence and potential conflicts of interest in the investigation.</p>

          <p>Morocco's role as a connector country, with its free-trade agreement with the European Union and growing economic ties with China, has become precarious amid the ongoing trade war. Chinese companies are increasingly investing in Morocco's automotive sector to circumvent tariffs, making the country a crucial conduit for exports to Europe. However, rising tensions between China and the West create a difficult balancing act for Morocco, where economic and geopolitical concerns do not always align.

          <p>Poland, once a staunchly pro-American country, is facing new anxieties about its security due to President Trump's threats to abandon European security commitments and Russia's aggression in Ukraine. In response, Poland is taking a leadership role in the European Union, increasing military spending, and organizing civil defense training for citizens. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has even suggested the possibility of Europe developing its own nuclear arsenal, signaling a potential shift away from reliance on the American nuclear umbrella. Poland's location on NATO's eastern edge makes it a crucial bulwark against Russian encroachment, underscoring the importance of its security measures.</p>

          <p>Despite the war, Ukraine's economy has shown resilience due to effective military resistance and economic management, supported by tax revenue and voluntary fundraising. However, the country's wartime resilience relies heavily on foreign financial assistance, leading to a negative gross domestic savings rate. While Russia's economy has defied expectations due to high oil prices, it faces challenges with falling oil demand and a reliance on fossil fuels. A recent minerals agreement with the United States, though seen as a victory for Ukraine, highlights the country's dependence on its allies and raises concerns about potential exploitation of its strategic resources.</p>

          <p>India's recent strikes on Pakistan mark the latest escalation in a decades-long conflict over Kashmir, a disputed region between the two nations. The conflict, rooted in the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, has led to multiple wars and periods of intense insurgency, with Kashmiris having little say in their own fate. Despite attempts at peace, tensions have persisted, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting militant groups in the region. The current escalation follows a terrorist attack in Kashmir, prompting India to retaliate with strikes, further destabilizing the already volatile relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to transport a group of immigrants to Libya on a U.S. military plane, according to U.S. officials.

          <p>Despite concerns over macroeconomic headwinds, consumer sentiment in China remains resilient, with a surge in domestic tourism during the May Labor Day holiday. Trips to rural areas and farm-themed stays have seen significant increases, while cities are stepping up efforts to attract tourists through various means. The growth in tourism contrasts with tepid retail sales, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities. China has also expanded its visa-free policies to attract foreign tourists, contributing to a rise in inbound travel. This article does not contain investment advice.</p>

The boy's parents and two others were hospitalized following the human smuggling event, prosecutors confirmed. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday night announced that she will request the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty.

          <p>The Dodgers' overworked bullpen contributed to a 5-4 extra-innings loss to the Miami Marlins, with manager Dave Roberts acknowledging the strain on the unit due to injuries and inconsistent starts. Key relievers were unavailable, forcing Roberts to turn to lower-leverage options who struggled in critical moments. Shohei Ohtani had a strong performance with a home run and a double, but the bullpen's inability to hold leads ultimately led to the defeat. The team's heavy reliance on the bullpen throughout the season is raising concerns about potential long-term consequences.</p>
