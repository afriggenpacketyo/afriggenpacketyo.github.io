          <p>Denmark's defense ministry has reported multiple drone sightings over its military installations, including Skrydstrup Air Base, following earlier incidents that temporarily closed civilian airports. The repeated and unexplained incursions have heightened security concerns across northern Europe, with officials describing the flights as sophisticated and intended to sow fear. In response, Denmark is proposing legislation to neutralize drones and has accepted an offer from Sweden for anti-drone support, while neighboring Germany also reports similar activity and is increasing its defense measures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system called Surface Alert (SURF-A) designed to give pilots more time to avoid potential disasters. The system uses GPS data to provide audible and visual warnings, such as "Traffic on runway!", which could have provided critical extra seconds of reaction time in recent near-collisions. While not yet required by regulators, the technology is being adopted by some major airlines like Southwest and American Airlines as an additional layer of safety to mitigate risks in increasingly congested airports.</p>

The author explores the enduring debate over whether the First Amendment protects hateful and offensive speech, drawing parallels to contemporary free speech controversies. The piece quotes the ACLU lawyer involved, David Goldberger, who, despite finding the case personally painful, maintains that denying speech because it is offensive allows officials to censor any expression they dislike, reaffirming that free speech must apply universally.</p>

          <p>President Trump's longstanding public criticism of former FBI Director James Comey, which intensified after Comey's recent indictment, may provide legal grounds for the defense to challenge the case. Legal experts suggest that Trump's comments create strong evidence for a motion to dismiss the charges based on selective or vindictive prosecution, arguing the case is motivated by political animus. The situation is further complicated by the abrupt replacement of the top prosecutor in the Virginia office with a Trump aide just before the indictment, and reports that career prosecutors had previously recommended against filing charges.</p>

However, economist Britta Glennon from the Wharton School argues this policy could harm the U.S. economy by stifling innovation and entrepreneurship, as skilled immigrants contribute significantly to both.

While experts consider this outcome unlikely due to the strength difference between the two systems, the possibility highlights the complex dynamics of an active hurricane season.

The article contends that the book confirms Joe Biden should not have run for re-election and illustrates Harris's own political weaknesses, such as her choice of Tim Walz as a running mate, whom she now criticizes for his debate performance. The analysis suggests Harris's memoir lacks self-awareness regarding policy failures on immigration and inflation, and the role identity politics played in her defeat.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, many Trump administration allies have framed the event and their political agenda as a "spiritual war," drawing language from the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a growing charismatic Christian movement. This movement views politics as a cosmic battle against demonic forces and believes God has anointed leaders like Donald Trump to establish a new Christendom. The article notes how influential NAR figures have called Kirk a "martyr," casting his death as the work of satanic forces and mobilizing followers who see events like the January 6th insurrection as tangible forms of spiritual combat.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's tendency to openly admit to actions that past presidents would have concealed, such as pressuring the attorney general to prosecute political rivals, has altered the nature of political scandals. By being brazen about his conduct, Trump avoids the typical fallout from such revelations, as his supporters often perceive it as authenticity rather than corruption. This approach, combined with a constant stream of controversies, creates a "Watergate, Every Day" environment where individual scandals lose their impact, and institutional checks like Congress are less effective due to party loyalty.</p>

          <h2>Trump's "Domestic Terrorism" Memo Criticized as a Potential Tool for Political Vengeance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the killing of Charlie Kirk, President Trump signed a memorandum directing federal law enforcement to focus on "domestic terrorism," but his and his advisors' comments suggest a broader campaign against the American left. The memo references "extremism on migration, race and gender" and officials linked Black Lives Matter and antifa to an "organized campaign of radical left terrorism" without evidence. Critics have slammed the move as a "chilling" blueprint for political retribution that echoes historical periods of suppression like McCarthyism, while the White House dismisses these concerns as liberal hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has launched a system-wide investigation into allegations of antisemitism across the 22 campuses of the California State University system. As part of the probe, the EEOC has subpoenaed Cal State L.A. for the personal contact information of all its employees, raising significant privacy and free speech concerns among faculty. The California Faculty Association has urged its members to seek legal counsel before responding, while critics worry the investigation conflates criticism of Israel with antisemitism and could chill academic freedom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new NPR-Ipsos poll reveals that while about seven in ten Americans believe crime levels in U.S. cities are unacceptably high, there is no widespread support for President Trump's strategy of deploying the National Guard to police them. Approximately half of those surveyed oppose sending troops to their own town or a major city in their state. The issue is sharply divided along partisan lines, with a vast majority of Republicans supporting the deployments while a similar majority of Democrats oppose them, viewing the presence of troops as an unnecessary occupation and an overreach of presidential power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple self-check known as the "thumb test" could offer a clue about a person's risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing the thumb across the flat palm; if the thumb extends beyond the edge of the palm, it can indicate joint hypermobility, which is associated with connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome. These conditions can weaken blood vessel walls, increasing aneurysm risk. However, cardiologists caution that the test is not a diagnostic tool, as many with aneurysms will have a negative test, and a positive result does not confirm an aneurysm is present.</p>

          <p>The American state fair, a tradition dating back to 1841, has evolved significantly from its origins as a showcase for livestock and agricultural competition. While retaining its agricultural roots, today's fairs have transformed into large-scale events featuring everything from live music by major artists to elaborate craft competitions and a vast array of fried foods. The article traces this development, noting how early fairs focused on functional displays of farming techniques, while modern fairs have become pop-up theme parks that serve as a beloved pastime and contribute significantly to the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether investors should purchase Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares as they trade near the $500 level, weighing valuation concerns and economic uncertainty against the company's long-term strengths. While its earnings multiple is higher than in the past, it remains lower than the S&P 500, and the company has historically delivered growth despite similar valuations. The author concludes that for long-term, buy-and-hold investors, Berkshire's diversification across numerous industries and its potential to act as a safe haven during an economic downturn make it a persuasive buy.
