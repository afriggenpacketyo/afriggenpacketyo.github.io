            <p>Texas is considering a ban on consumable hemp products containing THC, just six years after legalization spurred a large industry. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick cites public health concerns and marketing to children as reasons for the ban, while opponents argue for stricter regulation instead. The ban could affect an industry estimated to be worth billions, impacting businesses and consumers who rely on these products for medicinal purposes. Some veterans testified that these products helped them quit opioids for pain management and PTSD.</p>

            <p>Campaigners are warning that the UK Supreme Court's ruling defining 'woman' by biological sex could negatively impact trans people's safety. The ruling, stemming from a case brought by For Women Scotland, clarifies that sex-based protections apply only to those born female. Transgender advocates fear this decision will fuel a culture war and limit access to single-sex spaces, while others claim it brings necessary clarity. The Equality and Human Rights Commission will update its code of conduct to reflect the ruling.</p>

            <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging the central bank to lower interest rates and expressing impatience for Powell's term to end.

Trump's remarks break the norm of political independence for the Fed and echo his previous criticisms of Powell. Powell has affirmed the Fed's independence, stating that he cannot be fired for policy disputes.</p>

            <p>Mortgage and refinance interest rates are currently elevated, presenting challenges for both new homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Securing a good rate is still possible with a strong credit profile and by comparing lenders. The Fed's potential pause in rate hikes could provide some relief to borrowers. Strengthening your credit score and shopping around for the best terms are crucial for obtaining a favorable rate. (not investment advice)</p>
