          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students after Harvard sued, alleging the ban violated the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted a temporary restraining order and set a hearing for Tuesday morning. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a "critical step to protect the rights and opportunities of our international students and scholars." The Trump administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders, citing concerns about campus policies and antisemitism, but the university refuted these claims, stating they responded as required by law. This dispute is the latest in the administration's standoff with Harvard, including threats to its tax-exempt status and federal funding. </p>

          <p>Federal prison officials visited Alcatraz to assess the feasibility of reopening the island prison following Donald Trump's announcement of plans to rebuild and reopen the facility, which has been closed for over 60 years. Superintendent David Smith noted that officials with the Federal Bureau of Prisons are planning further structural assessments. The facility was closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, limited space, and escape attempts. While California lawmakers dismissed the proposal, BOP director William Marshall suggested modern materials could address logistical challenges, with GGNRA already undertaking seismic retrofitting projects on the island. </p>

          <p>Despite recent diplomatic activity, including talks in Turkey and a phone call between Putin and Trump, a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine seems distant. Russia has not agreed to an unconditional ceasefire and continues to seek control over Ukrainian territory.

The Russian media has concluded that Moscow has strengthened its position, while Trump appears reluctant to increase pressure on the Kremlin, signaling a desire to reboot US-Russia relations. </p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer on the movie "Rust," has been released from prison 13 months after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April 2024 and has been paroled to Arizona through May 2026, subject to conditions including electronic monitoring and employment or school enrollment. Gutierrez-Reed received the maximum penalty for her role in the tragedy, where actor Alec Baldwin discharged live rounds from a prop gun, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter charge was dismissed after accusations of withheld evidence. </p>

The dinner, held at Trump's Virginia golf club, allowed the president to leverage his position for financial gain, both for his crypto business and the venue itself.

          <p>The Trump DOJ is seeking to dissolve the Flores Consent Decree, which has governed the detention and release of migrant children since 1997, arguing that it incentivizes illegal immigration at the southern border. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the decree is an unacceptable restriction on the administration's America-first immigration agenda. DOJ officials said the aim is to restore power to elected officials rather than a single federal judge in California. The motion to terminate the decree will be heard by Judge Dolly Gee, who has presided over the case for years, making it unlikely she will agree to dissolve the decree. </p>

These cuts are the largest in the programs' histories and could result in many people losing benefits. The bill would add roughly $3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, with the savings from Medicaid and SNAP helping to pay for tax perks primarily for the wealthy. </p>

Asrarguis argues that Milgrim’s name should not become a pawn or a rallying cry for those who seek to weaponize her death for political gain, but rather that people should reflect on her ideals and learn from her life’s work. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to dismiss criminal charges against a top MS-13 leader in order to deport him to El Salvador, sparking accusations of a deal with Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele. The MS-13 leader, Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, has knowledge of a secret pact between Bukele's government and the gang. Critics see the move as a way to prevent Arevalo-Chavez from testifying in a US court and revealing information about Bukele's past ties to the gang. The justice department cited "sensitive and important foreign policy considerations" as the reason for dismissing the charges. </p>

Johnson, 22, was awaiting trial for his alleged role in a home invasion that left a man killed and a child injured. The escape occurred when Johnson and another inmate opened the back door to the jail, and Johnson was then lifted over the perimeter fence by another inmate. This is the second time Johnson has escaped from the same jail, with manpower shortages, inadequate staff training, and lack of supervision cited as contributing factors. </p>

Harvard accused the administration of a "campaign of retribution" for rejecting the government’s demands.

Harvard’s president called the ban “unlawful and unwarranted,” stating that it would transform the university, where more than a quarter of the students come from other countries. </p>
