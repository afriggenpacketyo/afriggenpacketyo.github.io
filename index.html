          <p>The gunman responsible for the 2019 El Paso Walmart mass shooting, which killed 23 people, will avoid the death penalty under a plea deal.  This decision, driven by the wishes of a majority of victims' families for closure, will see him serve life in prison without parole.  Not all families agree with this outcome.</p>

          <p>The UK's Spring Statement is generating mixed reactions, with concerns about a grim economic outlook and potential future tax increases.  While the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, pledges to boost defense spending and protect vulnerable populations, criticism focuses on proposed welfare cuts and public perception of her handling of the economy.

          <p>A Chinese economist at the Boao Forum for Asia characterized the US-China trade war as a “negative-sum game,” arguing that it prioritizes dominance over economic benefit.  Concerns were also raised about the future of free trade due to the decline of multilateralism and the marginalization of the World Trade Organization.

          <p>President Trump's new executive order mandates proof of citizenship for voter registration, potentially disenfranchising millions and sparking legal challenges.
