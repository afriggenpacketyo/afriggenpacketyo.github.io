          <p>A political standoff is occurring in Texas after Democratic state lawmakers left the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial new congressional map. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent Democrats from office if they do not return, a move the Democrats have defied. The proposed map, supported by former President Trump, could significantly increase Republican seats in the House of Representatives and is being challenged as a partisan gerrymandering effort that could harm minority voters.</p>

          <p>Shares of Berkshire Hathaway fell after the conglomerate reported a 4% decrease in quarterly operating earnings, largely due to a downturn in its insurance underwriting business. Investors were also disappointed by the company's continued halt on stock buybacks and its ongoing sale of equities, which has now continued for eleven consecutive quarters. The report also included a significant $3.8 billion write-down on its Kraft Heinz investment, a move Warren Buffett has previously acknowledged was overpriced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce is legally intervening to support the federal government against a lawsuit led by California Governor Gavin Newsom. The lawsuit aims to reinstate California's authority to set its own stringent electric vehicle mandates, which were previously rescinded by resolutions signed by President Trump. The business group argues that the mandates are commercially damaging and that the courts lack the authority to overturn the congressional actions that blocked them, framing the issue as a matter of federal overreach and economic stability.</p>

The judge described the case as one of the most awful instances of animal cruelty she had seen, noting the act was premeditated and involved mutilation. Disturbingly, notes found on the boy's phone detailed a desire to kill a person, and the girl had a fascination with mutilated animals, prompting concerns about the potential for further violent offending.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a specific type of bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, as the cause of a devastating sea star wasting disease that has killed billions of starfish along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The epidemic has critically endangered species like the sunflower sea star, leading to ecological imbalances such as the explosion of sea urchin populations and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery provides a crucial breakthrough, offering hope for developing interventions to help restore sea star populations and the broader marine ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Two men have been charged in connection with the alleged kidnapping and sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton, England. One man faces two counts of sexual assault, while the other is accused of kidnap, strangulation, and aiding the assault. The case has drawn political attention, with a local council leader from Reform UK alleging the men are asylum seekers and accusing authorities of a cover-up, a claim that has fueled wider debate but remains unverified by police, who cite national guidance.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Nancy Mace, who has transitioned from a critic of Donald Trump to a staunch loyalist, has officially launched her campaign for governor of South Carolina. Mace, who now calls herself "Trump in high heels," is entering a crowded Republican primary where she will compete for the former president's base of support. Her campaign platform focuses on eliminating the state income tax, cracking down on crime, and advancing conservative positions on cultural issues like gender identity in schools, cementing her political transformation.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestine activists are planning a mass protest in Westminster where participants intend to hold signs supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. This act of support is now an offense under the Terrorism Act, and the Metropolitan Police have warned that anyone participating can expect to be arrested. Organizers state that at least 500 people are expected to take part in the act of civil disobedience to challenge what they see as a disproportionate ban on the protest group.</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, giving the latter its first-ever PCC. Announcing his decision alongside Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, Matthews stated that the country's political elite had failed and it was "time for Reform." The move is seen as another sign of the Conservative party fraying at the local level and the growing influence of Reform UK on the right of British politics.</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise that annuities can be a valuable tool for certain individuals but are not suitable for everyone, especially in the current economic climate. Near-retirees who want to lock in currently high interest rates and risk-averse individuals seeking guaranteed lifetime income may find them beneficial. However, younger investors with long time horizons, those who may need access to their cash soon, or anyone carrying high-interest debt should likely avoid annuities, as their funds could be better utilized for growth or debt repayment.

          <p>President Donald Trump and his top economic advisor have amplified baseless claims that the recent disappointing jobs report was "rigged" by federal employees to undermine his administration. This narrative emerged after Trump abruptly fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner, a move the White House now defends as necessary to ensure data reliability with "a fresh set of eyes." The comments echo Trump's past efforts to undermine trust in official processes and data when they are politically unfavorable to him.</p>

          <p>More than 10,000 hotels across Europe have joined a class-action initiative against the online travel platform Booking.com, seeking damages for alleged unfair business practices. The complaint, supported by major hotel associations, argues that the platform's historical use of "best-price" clauses illegally prevented hotels from offering lower prices on their own websites, causing financial losses between 2004 and 2024. Booking.com has rejected the claims, stating that its partners are free to set their own pricing strategies.</p>
