        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by a significant outperformance in its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased by 22% to $3.72 billion, with revenue climbing 15% to $14.58 billion. This success was largely attributed to a 36% jump in equities trading revenue, which generated $4.3 billion, and a 9% rise in fixed income trading, as market volatility from U.S. tariff policies benefited Wall Street activities. The strong results reflect a broader trend of positive earnings from other major banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a notable shift in tone, a prominent Chinese state-run newspaper, the Economic Daily, has published an editorial supporting the country's internet platform companies. The article highlighted the importance of these firms, which provide services like food delivery, alongside "hard-tech" sectors such as aerospace and chip manufacturing. This change reflects Beijing's move towards a more favorable position on e-commerce and technology giants after a period of intense regulatory crackdowns. The editorial emphasized that innovations improving daily life are as crucial as breakthroughs in core "stranglehold technologies."</p>

          <p>Wang Huning, China's fourth-ranked official, has stressed the strategic importance of boosting domestic demand to ensure the nation's long-term economic health. Speaking at a political advisory meeting, he called for in-depth research and practical policy proposals that can be translated into "actionable results." This high-level focus on consumption comes as China's economy faces challenges in lifting domestic spending. The remarks precede a key Politburo meeting at the end of the month, where analysts anticipate the announcement of further demand-side stimulus measures.</p>

          <p>Retail giant Target is experiencing a period of significant struggle, marked by falling sales, declining store traffic, and a weakened brand identity that once set it apart. Customers and analysts point to issues like out-of-stock items, less distinctive merchandise, and a decline in store standards and customer service. The company's performance has also been impacted by economic pressures, backlash over its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, and increased competition from rivals like Walmart and online retailers. As CEO Brian Cornell's tenure nears its end, Target is at a crossroads, attempting to innovate and regain its "cheap chic" appeal.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed to "physician assistants" to clarify their roles. The report, commissioned by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, addresses concerns about patient safety and confusion, suggesting these professionals should wear distinct uniforms and see patients only under limited circumstances. The review follows high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. The recommendations aim to establish a clearer framework for these roles within healthcare teams.</p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume in the United States fell by 10% last week, driven by rising interest rates and growing concerns about the economy, particularly the impact of tariffs.

Applications for home purchases dropped 12% to their slowest pace since May, while refinancing applications decreased by 7%. This slowdown in demand reflects a housing market where both potential buyers and sellers are becoming more hesitant amid economic uncertainty and softening home prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK has lifted a five-year ban on airlines from Pakistan, allowing them to apply to resume flights after the country made significant improvements to its aviation safety standards. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses, which came to light after a fatal Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) crash. The decision follows a similar move by the European Union's aviation safety agency earlier this year. Restoring these profitable routes is seen as a crucial step for the struggling state-owned PIA as it moves towards privatization.</p>

          <p>President Trump's fundraising for his future presidential library is drawing scrutiny over the lack of regulation and transparency regarding its donors. Senate Democrats are introducing legislation to cap contributions and require public disclosure, citing concerns that companies and special interests could use donations to seek favor. Unlike campaign funds, presidential library foundations can accept unlimited, anonymous donations from nearly any source, including foreign nationals. Recent contributions, including a Boeing 747 from Qatar and multimillion-dollar legal settlements, have intensified calls for oversight.</p>

          <p>China is actively promoting the international use of its currency, the yuan, with Africa serving as a key testing ground. During a recent visit by Premier Li Qiang to Cairo, the central banks of China and Egypt signed several agreements to facilitate the use of the yuan in trade, investment, and cross-border payments. These deals include expanding China's UnionPay services and enabling local currency settlements through CIPS, China's alternative to the SWIFT network. Egypt now joins other African nations like South Africa and Nigeria in strengthening financial ties with Beijing and reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>

One perspective, from Jewish Voice for Peace Action, highlights strong support for Mamdani, praising his focus on local issues and consistent progressive values, including support for Palestinian human rights. Another viewpoint expresses concern over his support for the BDS movement and his rhetoric on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while still offering support for his mayoralty.

Acknowledging that Democrats need to rebuild their image after the 2024 election loss, Martin outlined the "organizing summer" initiative. This effort aims to engage with communities on the ground long before the midterms, listening to their concerns and building relationships.

          <p>Physicians across the U.S. are navigating difficult conversations with patients about vaccines, as the federal government's anti-vaccine rhetoric creates a schism with established medical guidance. With officials like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questioning the safety and necessity of shots, some parents who previously vaccinated their children are now refusing immunizations for their newborns. Conversely, other patients are rushing to get vaccinated out of fear that access will soon be restricted. This divergence is eroding trust and forcing doctors to spend more time combatting misinformation, while creating practical concerns about insurance coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis argues that President Trump's dismissal of the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files represents a betrayal of his movement's populist roots. By telling his supporters to trust the government and stop questioning the non-release of documents, Trump is prioritizing personal authority over the anti-elite sentiment that defined his rise. The Epstein case had become a core symbol for many MAGA believers of a corrupt elite that Trump was meant to fight. This shift suggests his politics are less about a populist ideology and more about personal loyalty to him as a leader.</p>

Proposed innovations include incorporating bat flips into the Home Run Derby to create more viral social media moments and adjusting the schedule to better accommodate players.

          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont reported a 15% decline in sales in Japan for its fiscal first quarter, as a strengthening yen has tempered the tourist spending spree seen last year. Despite the downturn in Japan, the Cartier-owner's overall revenue rose 6% to €5.41 billion, slightly beating analyst expectations. The group's performance was bolstered by strong demand for its high-end jewelry brands like Van Cleef & Arpels, which saw sales rise 11%. However, the specialist watchmakers division continued to lag, reflecting a broader downturn in the luxury market. (not investment advice)</p>

This is the latest in a series of eruptions that began in late 2023 after the volcanic system, dormant for 800 years, reawakened, repeatedly affecting the region.</p>
