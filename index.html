          <p>In Oakdale, California, residents have shifted from traditional media to online sources for news, leading to uncertainty about trustworthy information. The decline of local newspapers and the rise of partisan news during the 2016 and 2020 elections have fueled this shift, with residents now relying on Facebook groups and online influencers. This reliance on social media has led to the spread of misinformation, culminating in an incident where an armed militia showed up in town due to a false rumor. While some residents attempt to moderate these online communities, others have created unfiltered groups, highlighting the challenges of finding reliable information in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious in a dramatic Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a safety car period after teammate Oscar Piastri led early on. A safety car, triggered by a crash between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, allowed Norris to pit for slick tires and rejoin the race in the lead. Max Verstappen initially finished fourth but was penalized for an unsafe pit release, damaging his front wing and dropping him to last place. The race was further complicated by changing weather conditions, with drivers making strategic pit stops for slick tires as the track dried.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Tamilore Odunsi, a 23-year-old British nursing student, was found stabbed to death in her Houston apartment just days before her graduation. Police discovered her body after a welfare check, also finding a man with stab wounds who was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Ms. Odunsi had documented her experiences as a Briton living in the U.S. on TikTok, expressing excitement about her upcoming graduation and booked holiday. A fundraiser has been launched to repatriate her remains to the UK, with her sister describing her as a kind and ambitious soul who dedicated herself to a life of care.</p>

          <p>Two commercial jetliners had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter, prompting Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to express strong disapproval. The incident occurred three months after a deadly mid-air collision involving a Black Hawk near the airport, which killed 67 people. The FAA said the helicopter took an indirect route, violating safety standards and requiring air traffic controllers to order the jetliners to perform "go-around maneuvers." Duffy has called for a review of helicopter restrictions around DCA, emphasizing that safety must always be the top priority.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, a move expected to increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. President Trump ordered these tariffs to promote domestic manufacturing, following earlier tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs will affect even U.S.-made cars, which often use imported components, and are not applied to parts from Canada or Mexico meeting trade agreement requirements. Automakers and suppliers warn that relocating assembly lines will take years, and uncertainty about trade policy discourages investment in domestic manufacturing.</p>
