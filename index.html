          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests following ICE operations. President Trump cited the inability of California's governor and Los Angeles' mayor to manage the situation as justification for federal intervention. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local authorities can handle the situation. Protests erupted after ICE conducted raids in multiple locations, resulting in numerous arrests, and the deployment raises questions about federal overreach and states' rights amid ongoing tensions over immigration policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, and the country's fertility rate is estimated at 1.1 children per woman, well below the replacement level. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women.</p>

          <p>Japan is not adequately prepared to maintain sanitary toilet conditions during disasters, leading to potential "toilet panic," according to a recent report. Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, public restrooms became unsanitary due to water and electricity cuts. Many people lack knowledge on how to use portable toilets, and experts emphasize the importance of sanitation to prevent infectious diseases. Educators are now teaching elementary school students about portable toilet use to improve disaster preparedness, and stockpiling portable toilets at home is also recommended.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. Some venture capitalists have suggested that European startups need to embrace overwork to compete globally, but many founders disagree. They argue that overwork leads to decreased retention and that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources instead. The youngest generation of workers also prioritize work-life balance and are less likely to tolerate toxic hustle cultures.</p>
