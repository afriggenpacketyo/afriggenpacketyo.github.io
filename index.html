          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Gaza's Food Distribution System Is a Facade for Starvation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 05:00:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article by Alex de Waal contends that the food distribution system in Gaza, particularly through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), is critically insufficient and serves as an alibi for the ongoing mass starvation. The author argues that the distributed aid is less than half of what is needed and the distribution method, requiring people to rush to military zones, favors the strong over the most vulnerable. De Waal asserts that this system degrades human dignity and is a central element in the destruction of Palestinian society, rather than a genuine humanitarian effort.</p>

          <p>A report details an increasing number of incidents where US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are arresting asylum seekers at their scheduled immigration court hearings. This tactic is being used even for individuals who have entered the US legally and are complying with due process, causing shock and fear within immigrant communities. The article suggests this is part of a broader, more aggressive enforcement strategy, creating a chilling effect that may deter migrants from attending their hearings, which could lead to automatic deportation orders.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradoxical situation where median home prices have hit an all-time high even as the overall number of sales has decreased. This phenomenon is driven by a bifurcated market where high-income and all-cash buyers, bolstered by wage growth and stock market gains, are able to purchase expensive properties. Meanwhile, high mortgage rates and soaring prices are locking out many first-time and middle-income buyers, contributing to the slow sales volume. The article notes that while inventory is slightly up, the market remains challenging for the average American. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have declared that disarmament is a "red line" as they navigate a critical political juncture. A planned peace meeting with Syria's interim government has been postponed, with key disagreements over the integration of Kurdish forces into the national army and control over their autonomous region. The situation is complicated by Turkey, which views the SDF as a threat and is seeking a defense agreement with Damascus, potentially at the expense of Kurdish autonomy.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), according to a source familiar with the matter. The independent panel is responsible for making evidence-based recommendations on which preventive health services, such as cancer screenings, should be covered by insurance. The source indicated that Kennedy views the expert group as being too "woke." An HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made, but the move would represent a significant and controversial shift in U.S. public health policy.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step forward in its advanced nuclear energy program with the completion of the design for its first commercial gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor, the CFR-1000. This fourth-generation reactor technology aims to be a more fuel-efficient source of power. The design has passed a national review and is now awaiting final approval, with the facility expected to become operational after 2030. The development positions China alongside other major nuclear powers, like Russia and the U.S., that are also working on similar advanced reactor technologies.</p>

          <p>At least 15 people were killed and approximately 30 others were injured when a double-decker bus crashed in the Junin region of central Peru. The bus, which was traveling from Lima with over 60 people on board, went off the road and fell into a ravine, landing on its roof next to a river. Such fatal accidents are unfortunately not uncommon in the country, with authorities often citing reckless driving, excessive speed, and poor road conditions as primary causes. An investigation into the specific cause of this latest crash is currently underway by local authorities.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned the Hong Kong government for offering cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists living in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries described the bounties as an act of "transnational repression" and affirmed that the UK will protect the rights and safety of those who have made it their home. The targeted individuals are accused of violating Beijing's national security law. This is the latest in a series of such bounty announcements from Hong Kong authorities targeting activists living abroad.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines passenger plane executed a dramatic dive shortly after takeoff from Burbank, California, to avoid another aircraft, injuring two cabin crew members. Flight data shows the Boeing 737 dropped 300 feet in just 36 seconds, causing unbelted passengers to be thrown from their seats and creating panic on board. The nearby aircraft was believed to be a Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The flight was able to continue safely to its destination, but the incident has raised further concerns about aviation safety in the U.S. following a series of recent near-misses.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been questioned by the U.S. Justice Department. The questioning, which took place over one and a half days, reportedly covered a wide range of topics and individuals connected to the case. Her lawyer stated that she answered all questions truthfully and that no offer of clemency was made for her cooperation. The development comes as President Trump's past association with Epstein has received renewed attention, although he has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
