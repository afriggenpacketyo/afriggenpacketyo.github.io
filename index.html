          <p>A shooting and fire at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, is being investigated by the FBI as "an act of targeted violence." The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old Iraq war veteran, drove his vehicle into the church and opened fire with an assault rifle, killing four people and injuring eight others before dying in an exchange with police. Approximately 100 people were inside during the Sunday service. Officials praised the heroic actions of church attendees and first responders, and have asked the public to avoid the area as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, with projections showing a drop from 35 million to 34 million beneficiaries in 2025. Health insurers are scaling back unprofitable plans and exiting certain markets due to shrinking profits from higher-than-expected medical costs and new regulations affecting government reimbursements. While the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services anticipates a stable market, seniors may face higher premiums and reduced benefits in 2026 plans as insurers prioritize profitability over growth.

          <p>At the UN General Assembly, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov issued a stark warning to NATO and the European Union, stating that any aggression against Russia would be met with a "decisive response." Lavrov dismissed accusations of Russian airspace violations and plans to attack NATO countries as provocations, repeating Kremlin claims that the war in Ukraine resulted from NATO's eastward expansion. He also condemned Western leaders for rejecting a China-Russia proposal to extend the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, accusing them of sabotage and blackmail.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, France, and Germany have triggered the reimposition of widespread UN sanctions against Iran, arguing that Tehran has violated the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal. The "snapback" sanctions, which had been lifted under the agreement, will freeze Iran's overseas assets, ban arms deals, and penalize ballistic missile development. European foreign ministers stated they remain open to diplomacy, but felt they had no choice due to Iran's nuclear program advancements beyond plausible civilian use, a claim Iran denies.</p>

          <p>In a rare address to the United Nations General Assembly, a high-ranking North Korean official, Kim Son Gyong, declared that Pyongyang will never surrender its nuclear weapons. He stated that demanding denuclearization is equivalent to demanding a violation of the nation's sovereignty and right to exist under its constitution. Despite this firm stance, the official's speech left open the possibility for diplomacy, echoing recent comments from leader Kim Jong Un about being open to talks with the United States, provided North Korea can maintain its nuclear arsenal.</p>

However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning a shutdown could disrupt key customer services. According to the agency and experts, services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards could be temporarily halted until a funding agreement is reached by lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the northwestern Bahamas on Monday. However, its projected path shows it moving away from the southeastern U.S. coast and turning toward Bermuda later in the week. Swells generated by the storm are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <h2>Surge in Argentine Soy Exports to China Following Tax Suspension Causes Friction Within Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>Argentina's soybean export orders reached a seven-year high after Chinese importers capitalized on a temporary suspension of the country's export taxes. This development has reportedly caused frustration within the Trump administration, as it occurred shortly after the U.S. provided financial support to Buenos Aires. An Iowa grain trader expressed anger in a text message, viewed by the Treasury Secretary, that the U.S. bailout inadvertently allowed Argentina to undercut American farmers by offering cheaper grain to China during a key selling season.</p>

          <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported goods like kitchen cabinets, furniture, and construction trucks are expected to worsen the already severe U.S. housing affordability crisis. These taxes join existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have already added thousands of dollars to the cost of building a new home. Housing experts warn that each price increase pushes more families out of the market, while developers face supply chain uncertainty, potentially slowing down the construction of much-needed housing stock.</p>

While pledging to keep taxes, inflation, and interest rates as low as possible, she stated that global headwinds and "long-term damage" to the economy have made the government's choices harder. Reeves emphasized a commitment to fiscal responsibility, criticizing past Conservative policies and dismissing calls from within her own party for unconstrained spending.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has escalated a diplomatic dispute with Kyiv by stating that Ukraine is not a sovereign country because it relies on financial and military support from the West. His comments came as he dismissed Ukrainian accusations that Hungarian reconnaissance drones had violated its airspace. This exchange marks the latest deterioration in relations between the two neighbors, with Orban frequently questioning Western aid for Kyiv and maintaining cordial ties with Russia, a stance that has put him at odds with most NATO and EU leaders.</p>

          <p>The threat of a U.S. government shutdown has become a recurring feature of American politics, with 14 funding lapses occurring since 1980. Before that year, federal agencies largely continued operating during funding gaps, but legal opinions from then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti established that they lacked the authority to do so. While President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight brief shutdowns, the confrontations have grown longer and more frequent in the last decade, including the longest in history at 34 days under President Trump in late 2018.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis has become central to the fight against AI-generated deepfake pornography after discovering a man had used their social media photos to create explicit images and videos on a "nudify" website. The case highlights a significant legal loophole, as the creation of such content for personal use without distribution is not explicitly illegal in many jurisdictions. The women's advocacy has led to a proposed Minnesota bill that would fine tech companies for enabling the creation of nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes.</p>

The inquiry, which is examining the pandemic's severe and long-lasting impact on children, also heard that Williamson felt the subsequent closure in January 2021 was a "panicked decision" not centered on children's interests.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a $300,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,824. This represents a significant saving compared to earlier this year when rates were above 7%, and a saving of over $330 per month compared to the peak rates of October 2024, potentially saving homeowners tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.
