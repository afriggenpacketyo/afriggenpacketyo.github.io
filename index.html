          <p>Former President Bill Clinton has voiced strong criticism of President Trump's actions, particularly those that undermine the rule of law, and expressed confidence that these actions will ultimately make Trump less popular. Clinton emphasized the importance of elections in changing the current political landscape and defended the Democratic Party's efforts, asserting that their decisions are more complex than critics often acknowledge. He also reflected on his book, "Citizen: My Life After the White House," and his recent health scare, while affirming his belief in President Biden's capabilities and dismissing concerns about his cognitive decline. Clinton urged for unity and a return to valuing shared principles over political victories.</p>

          <p>At the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asean defence chiefs emphasized their individual agency, with the Philippines asserting that it is not a pawn in the rivalry between the United States and China. This assertion came after the US Defence Secretary urged Indo-Pacific allies to increase military spending to counter China's influence. Despite acknowledging China's pursuit of superpower status, the Philippine Secretary of National Defence stressed that smaller states are acting in their own strategic interests, not merely at the behest of major powers. The Asean nations seek to diversify trade ties and avoid economic uncertainties stemming from US tariffs.</p>

An appeals court reinstated President Trump’s tariffs after a previous court order had blocked them. Hassett stated that the administration is very confident that the judges would uphold the law and that Plan A is all they're ever going to need. The original injunction was based on the court's decision that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the right to set unlimited tariffs.

          <p>The Trump administration's increasingly restrictive policies towards Chinese students are causing many families in China to reconsider their children's education in the United States. These policies include visa revocations for students with ties to the Communist Party or those studying in critical fields, as well as stricter vetting measures and potential cuts to international student proportions at universities. As a result, many Chinese families are now exploring alternative educational opportunities in other Western nations or closer to home.

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist outlines six daily practices to build trust with children, based on experience with over 1,000 kids. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, modeling rather than interrogating, incorporating real talk into routines, and teaching coping strategies. The author emphasizes that trust is built in small moments and requires parents to be open, honest, and emotionally available. Creating a safe space for children to share their emotions and experiences is key to fostering a strong, trusting relationship.</p>
