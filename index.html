          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo has unveiled its new mixed-reality headset, the Vivo Vision, positioned as a lighter and more affordable alternative to Apple's Vision Pro. Weighing 35% less and likely costing one-third as much, the device features 8K resolution organic-light-emitting-diode displays and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform for enhanced visuals. It supports intuitive eye tracking and hand gestures, similar to its US rival. Currently, the Vivo Vision is compatible with select Vivo phones and Windows 10 or later computers, signaling a significant development in the competitive VR market and potentially expanding access to advanced mixed-reality technology.</p>

          <p>Donald McPherson, celebrated as America's last surviving "ace" Navy fighter pilot from World War II, has died at the age of 103 in Nebraska. McPherson achieved his "ace" status by shooting down five Japanese planes while flying F6F Hellcat fighters aboard the USS Essex in the Pacific theater. His distinguished service earned him the Congressional Gold Medal and three Distinguished Flying Crosses. After the war, he returned to his hometown, where he worked as a letter carrier and became a beloved community figure, helping establish youth baseball leagues and serving as a Scoutmaster, leaving a lasting legacy of heroism and civic dedication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A disability charity in the UK is urging all airports to eliminate drop-off fees for blue badge holders, citing the current system's complexity and inconsistency. Many airports offer discounts or waivers, but these often require challenging online or phone registration processes, which can be difficult for some disabled individuals. Disabled Motoring UK argues that people with disabilities deserve respectful treatment and should not be "fleeced" for essential access close to terminals, especially as over half of the busiest UK airports have raised these fees. The article details varying airport policies, from free access to charges with longer stays, emphasizing the need for a standardized, equitable approach.</p>

          <p>Three previously unknown oil paintings attributed to the influential avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich, with a potential value exceeding £100 million, are currently exhibited in Bucharest, though their authenticity faces significant scholarly debate. The owner, Yaniv Cohen, states his grandmother inherited the works, which were found under her bed, from her father, an Odesa accountant. However, art historian Konstantin Akinsha highlights a lack of documentation from Malevich's lifetime, casting doubt on their provenance. While technical analyses confirm pigments date to Malevich's era, these reports do not definitively prove the artist's hand, fueling ongoing skepticism within the art community regarding these potentially monumental discoveries.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million Americans in the West are under extreme heat warnings, with record-challenging temperatures affecting cities from Arizona to Washington, including areas unaccustomed to prolonged heat like Portland and Seattle. The heat wave, coupled with low humidity, is fueling elevated fire weather concerns and localized flash flooding from monsoon thunderstorms. Simultaneously, Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the Atlantic, becoming the sixth named storm of the season. While not expected to impact the US directly, it is forecast to strengthen, and lingering effects from Hurricane Erin continue to cause rough surf and dangerous rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Experts and affected families are advocating for the expansion of the UK's mandatory food allergen list to include pea protein, pine nuts, buckwheat, and sheep/goat's milk. This call follows severe anaphylactic shocks experienced by children like nine-year-old Rex, who reacted to pea protein in a hot cross bun and ice cream where it was not clearly labeled. Parents describe navigating food choices as a "game of roulette" due to the increasing, often unexpected, inclusion of pea protein in products. The current 14-allergen list is deemed insufficient, leading to serious health risks and a lack of awareness among the public and food service staff.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal reports that the Pentagon has been preventing Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to strike targets deep inside Russia since late spring. This restriction, reportedly part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin, involves a "review mechanism" governing the use of US and US-dependent European long-range weapons. While the Biden administration previously authorized ATACMS use against Russian targets, Trump expressed strong disagreement with such actions. The move comes amid increasing control over munitions to Ukraine as US stocks diminish, raising questions about US policy and Ukraine's offensive capabilities.</p>

The test follows an incident where South Korea fired warning shots at North Korean troops briefly crossing the Demilitarized Zone. This development further escalates regional tensions, occurring amidst ongoing large-scale joint military exercises by South Korea and the United States, and Kim's recent vow to accelerate the country's nuclear weapons program.</p>

Petitions reaching 100,000 signatures can trigger a debate in Westminster Hall, though government action is not guaranteed.

Sydney Brown, 25, began injections at 23, with her plastic surgeon mother administering treatments. Proponents suggest it can slow the formation of deeper lines by relaxing facial muscles, reducing skin creasing. However, experts like consultant plastic surgeon Nora Nugent caution against starting too young, deeming it potentially ineffective and a waste of money before lines are present. The article highlights concerns about social media pressure, the risk of complications from unscrupulous practitioners, and the unknown long-term effects of lifelong botox use.</p>

Despite recent increases in humanitarian assistance, UN and other aid agencies assert that the quantity remains inadequate, compounded by widespread displacement and collapsed food production.

          <p>The United States immigrant population has seen a decline of over a million people since Donald Trump's second term commenced in January, marking a reversal of a 50-year growth trend, as reported by a new Pew Research Center study. The total number of immigrants decreased from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June 2025, with approximately 750,000 immigrant workers exiting the US labor force. This significant shift is attributed to a combination of Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, including mass deportations, and previous asylum restrictions. Mexico remains the largest country of origin, though its share of the US immigrant population has also decreased, highlighting the profound impact of recent immigration policies.</p>

Marineland managers state the stimulation is necessary to manage Keijo's adolescent sexual urges and prevent potential injury from fighting with his mother, who is also his half-sibling.

Representatives Ro Khanna and Summer Lee criticized the limited new disclosures, which reportedly amount to fewer than 1,000 pages of Customs and Border Protection flight logs for Epstein's plane from 2000-2014, and called for full transparency. This push for more information, influenced by President Trump's supporters, underscores ongoing efforts to shed light on the Epstein case, with the committee having also subpoenaed high-profile witnesses. The situation highlights continued demands for accountability and comprehensive disclosure regarding the controversial case.</p>

          <p>Several major European parcel companies, including DHL, Royal Mail, and national post offices from France and Spain, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the United States. This action is a direct response to a new executive order from President Trump, which eliminates the "de minimis" rule allowing duty-free entry for packages under $800, effective August 29. The companies cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems for customs duty collection and data transmission as the primary reasons for the pause. While letters and small gifts are unaffected, the change significantly impacts business shipments, with DHL Express remaining a more expensive option. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts observe that China's already substantial defense industry can be further bolstered by its civilian manufacturing sector.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old El Salvadoran, who was previously wrongly deported by the Trump administration, now faces the alarming prospect of deportation to Uganda. After his recent release from federal detention, immigration officials reportedly offered him deportation to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea on human smuggling charges. His defense lawyers are strongly challenging the proposed deportation to Uganda, emphasizing his lack of language proficiency and documented human rights concerns in the country, especially when more suitable options like Costa Rica exist.

          <p>The UK government is proposing a major overhaul of sentencing rules, which could enable courts to impose non-custodial punishments such as bans from pubs, concerts, and sports matches, alongside driving and travel restrictions. These reforms aim to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending, aligning with recommendations to reduce prison overcrowding by issuing fewer custodial sentences for less serious crimes. Offenders released on probation could also face similar restrictions and mandatory drug testing. While Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasizes cutting crime and making streets safer, critics voice concerns about the potential for increased pressure on the probation service and police, despite planned recruitment and a £700m funding boost.</p>

          <p>Widespread protests have occurred across the UK regarding the government's policy of housing asylum seekers in hotels, with demonstrations in cities like Bristol, Liverpool, and London, often met by counter-protests from anti-racism groups. Police intervened to separate opposing factions, resulting in several arrests for various offenses. These demonstrations follow a High Court ruling that prevented a hotel in Epping, Essex, from accommodating asylum seekers, prompting other local councils to explore legal action. Despite the government's stated commitment to phasing out asylum hotels, official figures indicate an 8% increase in asylum seekers housed in such accommodations since the current Labour government took power, highlighting persistent challenges and societal divisions.</p>
