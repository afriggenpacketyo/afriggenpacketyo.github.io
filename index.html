          <p>President Trump reported a "good" conversation with Russian President Putin, during which they discussed the Ukraine conflict, specifically Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian airfields, and the potential for Russia to respond. Trump also mentioned that Putin offered to participate in U.S. talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program, which Trump claimed Tehran has been delaying. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has described Moscow‚Äôs peace proposals presented earlier this week as nothing more than an ‚Äúultimatum.‚Äù The two sides signaled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies. The tone suggests ongoing tensions and complexities in international relations, with potential for both conflict escalation and diplomatic engagement. The optimism score is proportional to the general consensus of the state of the world. </p>

          <p>Daniel Jongyon Park was arrested in connection with the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing after allegedly providing approximately 270 pounds of ammonium nitrate to the primary suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus. Park and Bartkus shared a nihilistic ideology, believing that people should not be born without their consent and that "nonexistence is best." Investigators allege Park had recipes to create a bomb similar to the one used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. The suspects targeted the fertility clinic because of their extremist beliefs, leading investigators to treat the incident as an intentional act of terrorism. </p>

The tax authority confirmed it is contacting affected individuals to assure them their accounts are secured and no money has been lost. This was not a cyber or hacking attack, but rather a case of criminals using externally gathered personal information to imitate individuals and fraudulently claim rebates. HMRC stated that a criminal investigation has already taken place, with arrests made last year, and that measures were taken to intercept the incident and lock down compromised accounts.</p>

Politicians on both sides of the aisle have faced scrutiny for benefiting from stock trading while serving in office, and the article references multiple instances of such behavior.

While prices are rising at a moderate pace, there are widespread expectations of faster cost increases due to higher tariff rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the Republican policy bill, aimed at advancing President Trump's second-term agenda, would increase annual budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also projects that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as a result of the legislation, primarily due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. While Republicans claim the bill cuts waste and fraud, the CBO analysis suggests significant reductions in federal spending on Medicaid and food assistance programs. The article highlights the potential consequences of the proposed budget changes on the national debt and healthcare access.</p>

The court argues that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the special counsel are unable to fulfill their roles due to Trump's actions, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected by laws that are still in effect.

The new method combines AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis to more accurately estimate an ancient text's age. Researchers trained an AI model on 24 manuscripts with reliable radiocarbon dating and then used it to analyze the handwriting style of 135 scrolls with unknown dates. The AI analysis found the manuscripts are older than previous estimates overall, suggesting dates in the early second century BCE, and sometimes slightly earlier.</p>
