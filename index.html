          <p>Prominent late-night hosts, including Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and David Letterman, have publicly defended Jimmy Kimmel following the suspension of his show by ABC. Colbert criticized Disney, ABC's parent company, for capitulating to political pressure from the FCC, framing the decision as a blatant assault on freedom of speech. The collective response from the comedians underscores a growing concern within the entertainment industry about media censorship and the chilling effect of government intimidation on political commentary.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside Walt Disney's headquarters in Burbank, California, to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". Organized in part by the Writers Guild of America, the protesters labeled Disney executives as cowards for yielding to pressure from the Trump administration. The rallies, which also took place in New York, condemned the move as an un-American attack on free speech and called for Kimmel's immediate reinstatement to the air.</p>

          <p>Speculation is growing around China's new CJ-1000 missile, which, if official descriptions are accurate, could be the world's first hypersonic air-to-air weapon. While the Chinese military has not released detailed specifications or test results, its potential capabilities suggest it could fundamentally alter the principles of aerial combat. The development of such a weapon represents a significant technological leap and would introduce a new and formidable threat in air-to-air engagements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has become a central figure in the Trump administration's campaign against perceived media bias. It details his threats of regulatory action against ABC, which preceded the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, placing the event within a broader context of media companies capitulating to political pressure. The report highlights a growing trend where broadcasters, facing potential license challenges or merger reviews, are increasingly censoring content critical of the administration.</p>

          <p>Over a hundred protesters gathered on Hollywood Boulevard to oppose ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's comments on the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Demonstrators argued that the network capitulated to political pressure from the Trump administration, infringing on Kimmel's First Amendment rights. The protest, organized by the group Refuse Fascism, framed the suspension as a dangerous act of censorship that sets a chilling precedent for free speech and political commentary.</p>

          <p>A controversial mining project threatening Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp has been halted after The Conservation Fund, a nonprofit, purchased the land for $60 million. A mineral company had been seeking permits to mine for titanium and zirconium near the pristine wetland, a plan that scientists warned could lead to severe droughts and devastating fires. While this purchase is a major victory for conservationists who fought the project, the potential for future mining on other nearby private lands remains a concern.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's Taliban government has issued a new decree banning all books written by women from the country's university teaching curricula. This measure is part of a wider set of restrictions that also outlaws 18 academic subjects, including human rights and gender studies, which are deemed to be in conflict with the regime's interpretation of Sharia law. The ban represents another severe blow to women's rights and their participation in academic and public life, following previous edicts barring them from higher education.</p>

          <p>Richard Djerf, an Arizona prisoner scheduled to be executed for the 1993 murders of four members of a single family, has issued a handwritten apology for his crimes. In the note, Djerf stated that he will not seek clemency from the state board, writing, "If I can’t find reason to spare my life, what reason would anyone else have?"

          <p>France is facing growing concerns that it could become the "new sick man of Europe" due to a combination of political paralysis and severe economic pressures. The country's parliament is fractured and unable to pass a budget, while national debt is spiraling and mass strikes protest proposed austerity measures. President Emmanuel Macron's political authority has been severely weakened, casting doubt on the government's capacity to enact necessary reforms and avert a deeper financial crisis.

          <p>The Chinese government's recent interventions to curb a destructive price war within its solar equipment sector are showing early signs of success, according to industry analysts. After 18 months of sustained losses for manufacturers, government-led initiatives to control production capacity have started to stabilize prices for key components like polysilicon. This trend is expected to help leading solar companies return to profitability and bring much-needed stability to the globally important industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a single vote, the U.S. Senate has confirmed a block of 48 of President Trump's nominees for various executive branch positions. The mass confirmation was conducted under new procedural rules recently implemented by the Republican majority to overcome Democratic tactics that had created a significant backlog of appointments. This rule change, which allows for en bloc confirmation of non-judicial nominees with a simple majority, has been criticized by Democrats as a move that further erodes Senate traditions and norms.</p>
