          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of violent disorder as protesters threw fireworks, bottles, and petrol bombs at police. Five people were arrested, and 17 officers were injured, bringing the total number of injured officers to 32. The unrest began after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town. Local politicians expressed fears of further escalation and called for calm, while police urged those involved to reflect on their actions.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that states with permissive gun laws experienced a rise in pediatric deaths from firearm injuries between 2011 and 2023, while states with stricter laws did not. The study looked at firearm deaths of children 17 and under after a 2010 Supreme Court case that influenced state gun laws. Researchers grouped states into three categories based on their gun laws: most permissive, permissive, and least permissive. The study suggests that specific gun laws can help prevent gun deaths in kids and teens.</p>
