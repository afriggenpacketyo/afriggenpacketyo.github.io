          <p>Tesla is carefully considering entering the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, who cited the country's large middle class as a potential benefit. However, India's high import tariffs and luxury taxes on EVs, which could double Tesla's prices, present a significant challenge. While India has proposed reducing tariffs for companies that localize manufacturing, price pressures remain. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has discussed collaboration with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and negotiations are ongoing amid broader US-India trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

The attack, described as unusual due to the rare targeting of tourists, has drawn condemnation from world leaders, including President Trump, President Putin, and EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen, and has led to heightened security measures and emergency meetings. Prime Minister Modi has vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice, emphasizing India's resolve to combat terrorism.

          <p>Campaigners claim that Instagram's Teen Accounts, intended to provide enhanced protections for young users, still expose children to serious risks. Researchers were able to create fake accounts with false birthdays and were subsequently shown sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. The 5Rights Foundation report raises concerns about the platform's age checks, algorithms, and content moderation, especially as Ofcom prepares to publish its children's safety codes under the Online Safety Act. Meta defends its accounts, stating that they provide built-in protections for teens, limiting contact and content exposure.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry faces a challenging year due to the US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, potentially causing producers to cut capital expenditure by 10-20%. This could result in a slowdown in the expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). The sector is also dealing with a price war resulting from overproduction, which has led to a significant drop in export prices.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Profits Plunge, Musk to Reduce Time on DOGE</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 20:34:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's profits have plummeted, with CEO Elon Musk announcing he will spend less time on DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). Tesla's net income fell 71% year-over-year, and automotive revenue dropped 20%. Musk attributed the blowback against his DOGE work to those who were receiving wasteful dollars, but he also said he would continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters as long as it is useful. Analysts suggest this shift may be beneficial for Tesla, as investors want Musk to focus on his businesses.</p>

The court's conservative majority seemed ready to require the Montgomery County Board of Education to allow parents to excuse their children from instruction featuring storybooks that address these topics. The case centers on whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to freely exercise their religion. Several justices questioned why the school board would not allow opt-outs, given that they are permitted for other areas of instruction.</p>
