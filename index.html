          <p>Republican Senator Susan Collins has expressed growing frustration over President Trump's plan to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar for conversion into Air Force One. Collins believes the transaction raises concerns about political espionage, ethics, and constitutional issues, emphasizing the need for a thorough security scrub to detect any listening devices. She questions the pursuit of this gift, given the time required for security upgrades, and suggests that Congress may need to vote on the legality of accepting the gift. Collins acknowledges Trump's frustration with Boeing's delays but believes a gift jet is not the appropriate solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs will lead to price increases. CEO Doug McMillon stated that while the company will try to keep prices low, tariffs are too significant to fully absorb, and shoppers could see price increases soon. The company's U.S. store sales rose over 3%, and e-commerce sales jumped more than 20%, recording its first profitable quarter, and Walmart maintained its full-year financial forecast. Despite this, tariffs are weighing on the company, with potential price increases expected for discretionary items like electronics and toys, and the company will aim to keep food prices as low as possible.

          <p>Anticipated Ukraine peace talks in Turkey faced bluster and confusion, with Ukrainian and Russian delegations arriving in different cities and questioning whether they would meet. Ukrainian President Zelensky criticized the Kremlin for sending a midlevel delegation to Istanbul, calling Russia's attitude unserious, and stated he would send a delegation led by the minister of defense to show Ukraine's commitment to peace efforts. President Trump suggested that progress would be unlikely until he and Putin met, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to a lasting peace.

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief but also carries long-term consequences, especially concerning lenders' perceptions of creditworthiness. While the settled credit card account is likely closed, other accounts might remain open, though debt settlement can significantly damage credit scores. Rebuilding credit involves monitoring credit reports, starting with secured credit cards, and considering authorized user status on trusted accounts. It's crucial to maintain low balances, make timely payments, and wait before applying for new cards to stabilize the credit profile and demonstrate financial responsibility to lenders.

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey has warned investors that the retail giant will increase prices on many items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reprieve lowering duties on Chinese imports. The company is trying to mitigate the impact, but shoppers will likely see increases by the end of May and more in June, with higher markups than usual expected in the fiscal second quarter. Tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia are putting pressure on imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses, and Walmart is taking steps to reduce tariff exposure by switching materials and sourcing merchandise from different locations. Despite this, Walmart maintains its full-year forecast, anticipating that consumers seeking value amid higher prices may drive shoppers to its stores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's request to roll back injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship, limiting it to children born to lawful permanent residents. The court is considering the legality of district court judges issuing nationwide orders, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing this creates an unfair legal playing field. Justices questioned whether eliminating nationwide injunctions could lead to unlawful executive orders remaining in place for extended periods. Justice Sotomayor stated the order violates Supreme Court precedents, while Justice Jackson raised concerns that preventing nationwide orders would create a "Catch Me If You Can" system of justice. The court is expected to make a decision by early summer.</p>

The FDA will review the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children by October 31, pointing to concerns about gut microbiome alterations and potential links to lower I.Q. and thyroid issues.

          <p>Texas is experiencing an extraordinary heatwave with record-breaking temperatures across the central and southern regions, ranging from 100F to 111F, posing health risks to those without air conditioning or sufficient water. The extreme temperatures are expected to continue, with Austin breaking its previous record by reaching 101F. The heatwave is also testing Texas’s power grid, with energy demand surging to record levels due to air conditioner use. The scientific community links such intense and frequent heatwaves to the global climate crisis, although the Trump administration has rolled back efforts to address climate change.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living is widening, with a "minimal quality of life" out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The analysis considers costs beyond daily necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare. It also suggests that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a "functionally unemployed" rate topping 24%. The cost of basic economic security has doubled since 2001, while median earnings for lower earners have fallen, leading to concerns about social unrest and the unattainability of the American dream.

          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's manufacturing reliance on China has created an existential vulnerability for the world, fostering Chinese technological advancement. Apple has trained over 28 million workers in China, surpassing the U.S. investment in computer chip production. McGee contends that China wouldn't be what it is today without Apple, as Apple's suppliers took what they knew and offered it to homegrown companies. While the book has minor flaws, it persuasively exposes the close relationship between the trillion-dollar company and the global power, with troubling consequences.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold requires careful consideration rather than a fixed schedule, as it serves as a portfolio component for inflation protection and diversification. The conventional wisdom is that gold shouldn't make up more than 10% of your overall portfolio. Investors should determine their risk profile and how much money they have to invest to get to that 10% maximum. Waiting to get invested in gold is generally not advisable, as over time, the price only increases, accounting for minor drops. (not investment advice)</p>

Justice Sotomayor said early in the arguments that Trump’s executive order violates four Supreme Court precedents, while D John Sauer, US solicitor general arguing on behalf of the administration, said that Trump’s order was “protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship”.</p>
