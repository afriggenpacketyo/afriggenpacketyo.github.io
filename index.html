        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that historical child grooming investigations were significantly delayed by Manchester City Council's heavy redaction of evidence. Some documents provided to police had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value and affecting key operations. While the council cited complex data-sharing rules, a new, more efficient process has since been agreed upon with the police and Crown Prosecution Service. The report did note that Greater Manchester Police has made significant improvements in its handling of such cases.</p>

The book details how Eastwood engaged in numerous trysts during his 21-year marriage to his first wife, Maggie Johnson, behavior he reportedly described as "addictive." According to the biography, Eastwood operated as a "married bachelor" with an "understanding" from his wife, who he said accepted his independent nature.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article by Samuel Moyn argues that Donald Trump's presidency has reinforced, rather than dismantled, the long-standing American political orthodoxies of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. The author contends that Trump's major domestic spending bill, with its tax cuts for the wealthy, is a clear example of neoliberal policy. Simultaneously, his aggressive military actions, such as the strike on Iran, represent a revival of neoconservative foreign policy. The piece concludes that despite his populist rhetoric, Trump's actions demonstrate a fundamental continuity with the political consensus of the last half-century.</p>

          <p>The family of Madonna ‚ÄúDonna‚Äù Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, is fighting for her release after she was arrested by ICE agents from her yard in New Orleans. Her family was only alerted to the arrest by a neighbor who witnessed the event. Kashanian, who has no criminal record and a long history of community service, is being held in a Louisiana detention center. Her detention comes amid a nationwide immigration crackdown, and her family is struggling to find legal assistance due to the complexity of her case and high demand for immigration lawyers.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the policy platform of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is less radical than his critics suggest. The article examines some of his key proposals, including a rent freeze, publicly owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses, pointing out that these ideas have been tested and implemented with some success elsewhere. Rather than being pie-in-the-sky, his agenda is presented as a practical commitment to making government more effective and responsive to the needs of its citizens. This approach, the article suggests, resonated strongly with voters in the primary.</p>

          <p>In a critical column, Michael Hiltzik argues that Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have united over a shared passion for dehumanizing immigrants, exemplified by their recent tour of a new detention camp in the Everglades. Dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," the camp's harsh conditions were touted by both politicians as a deterrent. Hiltzik connects this event to the broader cruelty of the administration's immigration crackdown, citing documented accounts of brutal ICE raids and poor detention conditions in Los Angeles.

          <p>A review of Gary Shteyngart's sixth novel, "Vera, or Faith," praises its witty and potent exploration of a child's perspective in a near-future, politically deteriorating America. The story follows Vera, a sharp 10-year-old navigating her parents' dysfunctional marriage and a society on the verge of abandoning democratic principles. The novel uses her precocious point of view to critique how adults use language to obscure their feelings and how a child must grapple with the brutal simplicity of a world in crisis. The review highlights the book's cleverness and its timely commentary on our current political moment.</p>

          <p>A significant and growing political divide is emerging between young men and women in South Korea, reflecting a broader global trend. Experts point to socioeconomic pressures, a hypercompetitive job market, and a backlash against feminism as key drivers of this polarization. Many young South Korean men now feel they are the primary victims of gender discrimination, a sentiment that has fueled support for conservative politicians and created a new, powerful voting bloc.

          <p>Parent company Paramount Global's decision to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from Donald Trump has elicited a mixed reaction of anger and relief within CBS News. Trump had sued over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris, and many journalists see the payment as a capitulation to clear the path for Paramount's merger with Skydance Media. However, there is also a sense of relief that the settlement did not include a public apology, which was viewed internally as a critical line that could not be crossed. The episode highlights the ongoing tensions between journalistic integrity and corporate interests.</p>

Supporters argue this would provide critical flood protection, restore wildlife habitat for migratory birds, and reclaim sacred lands for the Tachi Yokut Tribe.

While some debate the appropriateness of "rave" culture for kids, experts note the events can be beneficial for family bonding if managed safely to avoid overstimulation.</p>

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the fading allure of the American road trip, diminished by ecological concerns, digital isolation, and deep political divisions. The author describes a cross-country drive where the experience felt flattened and monotonous until an unexpected stop in Shamrock, Texas, on the Fourth of July. An encounter with the warm, immigrant family running a local motel and the diverse guests gathered there restored his faith, however briefly, in the road's power to reveal a complex and shared national identity. The piece contemplates the potential for connection in a polarized country.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Ana, California, has created a $100,000 emergency fund to provide immediate assistance to families impacted by ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. Proposed by Mayor Valerie Amezcua amid community pressure, the fund will help cover basic necessities like food and rent for households where a primary earner has been detained. The move reflects the significant disruption and fear the raids have caused in the predominantly Latino community. The council also passed motions to seek more information on ICE operations and advocate for the removal of federal agents.</p>

          <p>A fact-check of President Donald Trump's major legislative package, the "big beautiful bill," examines claims regarding its financial and social impacts. Contrary to White House assertions, independent analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and tax experts indicates the bill would add over $3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. The report also confirms that the bill includes significant cuts to future Medicaid spending, which would lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance. The White House did not substantiate a specific claim about the magnitude of potential tax increases if the bill fails to pass.</p>

The sprawling legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts, increases defense and immigration spending, and makes significant cuts to social programs like Medicaid.

The market jitters occurred as Reeves faces intense pressure over a recent government U-turn on welfare cuts, which has complicated her budget plans.

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors, now available to people without diabetes, are revealing insights into how blood sugar affects general health. Research shows many individuals are "dippers," meaning their blood sugar rises and then plummets below baseline a few hours after eating, which can cause fatigue, mood swings, and increased hunger.
