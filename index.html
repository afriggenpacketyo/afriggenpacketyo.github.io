          <p>The Indiana Pacers, defying expectations, now lead their series against the Cleveland Cavaliers 2-0 after a dramatic comeback victory. Tyrese Haliburton's game-winning three-pointer capped off a rally from a 20-point deficit, securing the win on Cleveland's home court. Haliburton scored 11 of his 19 points in the final quarter, overcoming Mitchell's 48 points for the Cavaliers. The Pacers capitalized on Cleveland's turnovers and injuries to key players, setting the stage for a potentially series-clinching Game 3 in Indiana. The Pacers have not been to the Eastern Conference Finals since 2014.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled comprehensive measures to bolster the nation's economy, which is facing headwinds from ongoing trade tensions. The announced plans include interest rate cuts, a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, and targeted support for key sectors like technology, real estate, consumption, and elderly care.

          <p>Despite broader concerns about China's economic headwinds, domestic tourism is experiencing a significant surge, with travel during the May Labor Day holiday exceeding pre-pandemic levels. This trend indicates resilient consumer sentiment, with many Chinese prioritizing spending on travel and cultural experiences over traditional retail goods. Cities are investing in innovative attractions and experiences to capture this growing market, while relaxed visa policies are also encouraging a modest recovery in inbound international travel. The article suggests that tourism is a key driver of economic activity and reflects a shift in consumer spending priorities.</p>

This follows a previous incident where a Super Hornet fell overboard in the hangar bay.

          <p>Four women have filed a lawsuit against Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife, alleging sexual battery, assault, and workplace violations. The complaint, seeking $50 million in damages, alleges that the women, who worked as housekeepers for the Robinsons, were repeatedly sexually assaulted by Robinson. The suit accuses Robinson's wife of failing to take action to prevent the alleged acts and claims she had prior knowledge that her husband had previously settled other cases with women who experienced similar situations. The lawsuit also includes allegations of workplace violations, such as not being given proper rest periods and not being properly compensated for working overtime hours.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, in the Oval Office, adopting a friendlier tone after months of belittling Canada. Despite past rhetoric about potentially acquiring Canada, Trump expressed his love for the country and its people. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, including the construction of Barack Obama's presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen. Carney firmly stated that Canada was not for sale, and Trump acknowledged that it takes two to tango, seemingly backing away from his previous stance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration abruptly removed Alvin Brown from his position as vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a move that is considered rare. The White House did not provide a reason for the removal, which comes as the NTSB is investigating numerous active cases, including high-profile transportation accidents. Brown was appointed to the board in April 2024 and his term was expected to run through 2026. The agency includes five board members who serve five year terms, according to the NTSB website.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company and major Walmart supplier, is halting imports from China due to President Trump's tariffs. The company faced a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs on a recent shipment, and paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone during a one-month period. While the company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May, manufacturing and assembling bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable. The company has shifted some of its business to other countries also facing new tariffs.</p>

          <p>China, a major aluminum producer and consumer, relies on imported aluminum ore due to a lack of high-quality bauxite. However, a French technology developed by Yves Ocello from IB2 could change this. The technology transforms low-grade bauxite, which is abundant in China, into a high-quality material suitable for aluminum production. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with a Chinese firm to implement this technology, potentially reducing China's dependence on imported aluminum ore.</p>
