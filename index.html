          <p>Despite the imposition of ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs by the United States, China's exports experienced an 8.1% increase in April, surpassing market expectations.

          <p>Nearly 60 felony cases have been dismissed in Hanceville, Alabama, due to a grand jury finding a "rampant culture of corruption" within the local police department. Four officers and the police chief were indicted on charges related to mishandling evidence, leading to the recommendation that the department be abolished. An audit revealed that a significant portion of evidence was undocumented or missing, including firearms, cash, and drugs. The town's government placed the department on leave and subsequently decided to rebuild it from scratch.</p>

The United States defense contractors must cease using Chinese tungsten by 2027.

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to a trade deal that maintains tariffs on most UK goods while rolling back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In return, the US expects to expand sales of agricultural products in the UK. Analysts suggest the substantive benefits will be limited, despite the agreement being touted as a breakthrough. While some sectors in the UK express relief, the deal leaves UK goods facing higher tariffs than before.</p>
