            <p>Dive teams are still searching the Hudson River for wreckage from Thursday's helicopter crash that killed all six people on board. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recovered the main fuselage and parts of the tail but is still looking for the main rotor and other key components. Experts believe finding the main rotor is crucial to determining the cause of the crash, with theories including mechanical failure, drones, and birds being considered. The helicopter was carrying a Siemens executive and his family on a sightseeing tour; the NTSB is investigating a potential rotor malfunction.</p>

            <p>A plane carrying six people crashed in an open field near Copake, New York, resulting in at least one fatality. Emergency services responded to a 911 call, but the muddy conditions made accessing the crash site difficult. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed the aircraft was a Mitsubishi MU-2B-40 en route to Columbia County Airport from Westchester County Airport. Flight data indicates the plane deviated from its planned path before crashing. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will lead the investigation into the cause of the crash.</p>

            <p>CBS's "48 Hours" examines the 1987 murder of Selonia Reed, a 26-year-old woman found stabbed and sexually assaulted in her car. The investigation initially focused on her husband, Reginald Reed Sr., and his friend, Jimmy Ray Barnes, but lacked conclusive evidence. Years later, Lt. Barry Ward reopened the case, uncovering life insurance policies on Selonia and finding DNA evidence linking Jimmy Ray Barnes to the crime scene. Barnes claimed Reginald offered him $50,000 to kill his wife, leading to their indictment. Reginald Reed Sr. was eventually convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, while Barnes served a reduced sentence for his involvement.</p>

            <p>A helicopter crash in South Africa was caused by a penguin that was being transported in a cardboard box. During an aerial survey, a specialist requested to transport a penguin back from Bird Island, and the pilot agreed. The cardboard box slid onto the pilot's cyclic pitch control lever, causing the helicopter to roll and crash. Fortunately, no one, including the penguin, was injured, but the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The incident highlights the importance of secure cargo handling to prevent interference with flight controls.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports. This decision follows concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases. The exemptions, retroactive to April 5th, also cover semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House stated the exemptions aim to give companies more time to move production to the US, though these goods remain subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl. The move has been welcomed by tech investors and analysts who believe this is a positive development for the industry.</p>

Jingye, the Chinese steel-making firm that owns British Steel, cited financial losses and market challenges as reasons for the potential closure.

            <p>Residents of Wigtown, Scotland, have saved a 200-year-old pub from being converted into flats. The community stepped in to purchase the former Plough Inn, now renamed The Wigtown Ploughman, after it closed in 2022. With support from South of Scotland Enterprise and a community share issue, the pub has reopened, providing a boost to the local economy and community spirit. The pub aims to attract visitors and revitalize the town, which has experienced recent business closures.</p>

            <p>Sky has announced plans for a UK spin-off of the US TV institution Saturday Night Live, promising the same "live, fast-paced style". The US version has launched the careers of many comedic talents and has a long-standing heritage. However, there are notable differences between the two transatlantic TV industries, with the US version having a far bigger budget. Importing a legacy brand name like SNL may seem a gamble, especially at a time when the UK TV industry is faltering, but the sketch format lends itself perfectly to the social media age.</p>

While the government has secured the necessary raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running, the long-term future of British Steel remains uncertain, with nationalization looking increasingly likely.</p>
