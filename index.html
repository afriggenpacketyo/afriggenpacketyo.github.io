          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that former First Lady Jill Biden should address allegations of covering up her husband, former President Joe Biden's, mental decline. Leavitt cited multiple books published in 2025, including "Original Sin," which detail the deterioration of Biden's mental faculties while in office. The press secretary claims there is video evidence of Jill Biden shielding her husband from cameras and dismissing concerns, accusing her of lying to the American people. A spokesperson for Jill Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly set a new target of arresting 3,000 people a day as part of its anti-immigration agenda, a figure that triples previous arrest rates. This initiative, conveyed by Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) leaders, includes tactics such as mandating assistance from non-Ice federal law enforcement and arresting individuals at courthouses. Critics argue that this aggressive approach leads to the arrest of citizens, due process violations, and overcrowding in detention centers. Despite these efforts, the administration's deportation numbers remain below Trump's initial campaign promises.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that while Americans' views on the economy have improved slightly since winter, financial concerns and stress are more prevalent than feelings of security. The majority of Americans report that their incomes are not keeping pace with inflation, significantly influencing their summer plans, with those in better financial situations more likely to take vacations. Overall, feelings about finances range from stress and concern to security and optimism, but concern and stress are more frequently reported, especially among those with poor financial situations. Despite some positive shifts, economic ratings remain net-negative overall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding a significant crypto enforcement action. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal coincides with a broader shift in crypto regulation, including the Justice Department's disbanding of its crypto enforcement team. Binance is also expanding its presence in Pakistan and deepening ties with World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that directs profits to entities connected to the Trump family.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, as part of a series of clemency actions. Hoover, who received six life sentences in the 1990s for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, still faces a 200-year sentence in Illinois for murder, which a presidential commutation cannot affect. While Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, authorities allege he remained involved in promoting Gangster Disciples members from prison. The FBI has indicated that Hoover will remain imprisoned in the state system.</p>

          <p>President Trump reacted sharply to the "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," a Wall Street jab at his trade policies. The phrase, coined by a Financial Times columnist, suggests that Trump repeatedly backs down from initial tariff demands. When asked about the meme, Trump defended his decisions to slash tariffs on China and delay tariffs on European Union countries, calling the question "nasty." The legality of Trump's tariffs is currently in legal limbo, with the administration appealing a court ruling that deemed them unlawful.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily delayed a lower court's order that had blocked President Trump's tariffs, reinstating them while the court considers Trump's appeal. The administration argued that enforcing the ruling would cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario." The initial court opinion had deemed Trump's global tariffs "contrary to law," asserting that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs. The Department of Justice requested the stay to avoid irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy and national security.</p>

          <p>A California court has granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the California Coastal Commission, ordering Sable Offshore Corp. to halt construction and repairs on offshore oil pipelines until necessary approvals are obtained. The ruling supports the commission's claim that Sable violated the Coastal Act by performing work without proper permits. Sable insists it is operating under original permits and plans to appeal the decision, but the court sided with the Coastal Commission who argued that the work Sable performed falls under the definition of 'development' in the Coastal Act. The ruling comes after Sable resumed oil production at one of its offshore platforms.</p>

Despite past praise and attempts to establish a strong relationship, Trump is reportedly disturbed by recent images of violence in Ukraine.

          <p>This article explains what tariffs are, how they work, and why President Trump is using them. Tariffs are taxes on goods bought from other countries, typically a percentage of a product's value, which Trump says will encourage US consumers to buy American-made goods. Trump has announced tariffs on the European Union and China, but has reached a narrow agreement with the UK on some goods. However, the legality of Trump's tariffs is in legal limbo after a US trade court initially ruled that Trump did not have the authority to impose the sweeping import taxes.</p>

          <p>This article argues that selling the presidency has become Donald Trump's most successful business venture, surpassing his previous real estate and branding endeavors. The author points to instances like the pardon granted to Paul Walczak, a Florida nursing-home executive, after his mother donated to a Trump fundraiser. While direct evidence of bribery is hard to prove, Trump has created the impression that he is for sale, profiting from his position through various means, including attracting investments from foreign governments and corporations. This approach undermines the integrity of American rule of law, turning the government into a service for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how officials within the Trump administration have intensified their criticism of judges following unfavorable court rulings, particularly concerning the legality of the president's tariffs. The White House's reactions to these rulings appear to be designed to undermine confidence in the judiciary, signaling a continued pattern of challenging the independence and authority of the judicial branch when decisions do not align with the administration's agenda. This approach raises concerns about the erosion of institutional norms and the potential for politicizing the judiciary.</p>

          <p>The state of California is appealing a lower court decision that upheld Huntington Beach's voter ID law, which could require voters to show photo identification in local elections. Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber argue that the measure conflicts with state laws on election integrity and the constitutional right to vote. The state contends that while charter cities have autonomy, local laws cannot undermine statewide concerns. The voter ID law is one of several issues where Huntington Beach has clashed with California, asserting its charter city status.</p>
