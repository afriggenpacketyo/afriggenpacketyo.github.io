          <p>Colorado officials report that anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activists in Denver allegedly helped Jose Reyes Leon-Deras, an El Salvadoran migrant convicted of child sexual assault in Italy, avoid arrest. The group, Colorado Rapid Response, purportedly alerted Leon-Deras to ICE's presence via social media, allowing him to escape. ICE has requested public assistance in locating Leon-Deras, cautioning against approaching him. The city of Denver has spent over $356 million on migrant services, and a local ordinance limits cooperation with ICE. Optimism remains relatively low due to the severity of the crime committed and the potential danger to the community. </p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, reducing reliance on foreign software and improving the performance of small satellites. The Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat conducted over 1,000 hours of in-orbit testing using OpenHarmony, a lightweight version of Huawei’s open-source platform. The satellite delivered faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous setups. Following the mission, national technical standards are proposed to encourage broader adoption of OpenHarmony in commercial and research satellite missions in China. </p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with severe heart issues, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant after her body produced too many antibodies, making a traditional heart transplant risky. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, proposed the innovative surgery to address the antibody problem, as the liver helps reduce antibody levels. Post-surgery, Baker faced a long recovery and personal tragedy with the death of her husband, leading to financial instability. Her successful transplant has opened the door for similar procedures, offering hope to other patients with complex medical conditions. </p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans who fled to the U.S. after the Taliban regained power face potential deportation due to the Trump administration's policies. The administration revoked Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans and included Afghanistan in the revamped travel ban, raising fears among the Afghan community. Advocates and lawmakers argue that Afghanistan remains dangerous, particularly for minorities, women, and those who assisted U.S. forces. While the government encourages Afghans to self-deport, bipartisan efforts to provide permanent legal status have stalled. </p>

          <p>After years of growth, computer science enrollment is declining at many universities due to a grim job outlook for entry-level coders. The tech industry has experienced layoffs and hiring freezes, with artificial intelligence replacing entry-level coding jobs. A recent Pew study indicates that Americans believe software engineers will be significantly affected by generative AI.

          <p>The article discusses the exorbitant costs of in-home elder care, highlighting the case of a 100-year-old woman in Gardena, California, whose care costs $18,000 per month. Her daughter, Marian Sunabe, a retired school psychologist, expressed concern that most people cannot afford such care, leading to a national crisis. The United States lags behind other developed countries in providing affordable elder care options, with many middle-class Americans forced to deplete their assets to qualify for Medicaid. Experts suggest that families will increasingly need to rely on their own resources and live together to manage the financial burden of elder care. </p>

          <p>The U.S. government has requested that Japan increase its defense spending to 3.5% of its gross domestic product (GDP), which could lead to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting with Washington. The request, reportedly made by U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, is likely to strain relations between the two countries. Japan had previously committed to doubling its annual defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027.

Investigators are examining notebooks belonging to the suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, containing notes on Democratic officials and abortion rights supporters. Scholars suggest considering the rampage within the context of anti-abortion violence and its ties to conservative Evangelical Christian movements. The New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) is mentioned as a movement that frequently uses war imagery when discussing political and spiritual enemies. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen an increase in the commercialization of politics, with the launch of Trump-branded products and ventures. The Trump Organization recently entered the mobile phone business with a Trump-branded service and a "sleek gold" phone. Marketing experts suggest that these ventures reinforce Trump's political persona and play off Maga patriotism. The blurred lines between business and politics raise concerns about the influence of profit on policy and voter engagement. </p>

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt's new book explores an unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, a Joe Rogan fan, through surfing. Litt, a Yale-educated liberal, learns to surf with the help of his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a tattooed truck driver who listens to Joe Rogan and never registered to vote. Surfing becomes a metaphor for confronting fear and an antidote to overthinking, providing a neutral ground for connection.

          <p>An analyst warns that going to war with Iran could be perilous to American democracy, given the current political climate. The analyst argues that President Trump has assumed dictatorial control over law enforcement and is turning the military into his personal army. A war with Iran could strengthen Trump's control at home and lead to the suppression of dissent. The analyst suggests that the United States is at risk of becoming a military dictatorship and that war with Iran would hasten its demise. </p>

          <p>An NPR article critiques a plotline in Celine Song's film 'Materialists,' where the protagonist finds emotional growth through a side character's suffering. The article draws parallels to the film 'Showgirls,' where a character's sexual assault is used to redeem the protagonist. The author questions the use of sexual assault as a plot device in a romantic comedy, deeming it cynical. Despite these criticisms, the author remains interested in Song's future work, recognizing the potential for sharper films. </p>

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard now asserts that Iran could produce nuclear weapons within weeks, a shift from her previous testimony before Congress stating Iran was not building them. This change follows President Trump's claim that intelligence shows Iran possesses a "tremendous amount of material" and could develop a nuclear weapon within months. Gabbard shared a video of her March testimony, where she mentioned Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons. The US president said he believes Iran were "very close to having a weapon" and his country would not allow that to happen. </p>

          <p>China’s most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is reportedly developing the capability to carry out “deck load strikes,” a type of swarm attack designed to provide a first-mover advantage in combat. State media highlights this ability, noting the carrier's progress in sea trials and its expected commissioning by the end of the year. A deck load strike involves rapidly launching a large number of aircraft at once, a tactic previously used by the US Navy. The Fujian is expected to join two active carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, forming a three-carrier fleet for the Chinese navy. </p>
