          <p>Gold prices have surged in 2025, driven by inflation, geopolitical tensions, and central bank buying, leading to speculation about reaching $4,000 per ounce. Experts suggest that if gold maintains its current growth rate, this milestone could be achieved in 2025, with continued dollar devaluation being a key factor. Other analysts predict it could take one to two years, barring any major geopolitical events, emphasizing the importance of monitoring double-digit monthly or quarterly gains as a signal. Investment strategies include maintaining a long-term outlook, considering gold leasing, and investing in gold mining mutual funds, with experts advising to start investing now and use dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility.

          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of T1 Phone by Trump Mobile, a cellular service costing $47.45 per month that includes unlimited calls, texts, and data.

Eric Trump stated that this new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment, aiming to provide customer service by Americans for Americans.

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely for the company to achieve break-even operating margins this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty announced to staff that the airline will further reduce flights, pause retrofits, and park some of its Airbus jets. The company is also evaluating its leadership structure to identify ways to combine or restructure roles for greater efficiency. These measures are being taken as the airline continues to rely on borrowed cash to sustain operations, with hopes that demand and bookings will eventually rebound.</p>

China has also invested heavily in this technology, with the People’s Liberation Army deploying similar Q-UGVs in various operations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates starting to fall, experts recommend opening accounts sooner rather than later, as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates further this year. Shopping around for the best rates is crucial, especially when existing CDs are nearing maturity, and smaller community banks and credit unions should be considered. Choosing short-term CDs can offer better rates, while longer-term CDs provide protection against future rate drops, and CD laddering can balance both. Understanding the risks, including early withdrawal penalties, is essential, and maintaining an emergency fund is advised to avoid breaking CD terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Louise Casey has advocated for a national inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a "national reset" on the issue, urging openness to scrutiny and change from those providing evidence. Her report highlighted that authorities have been "shying away from" the ethnicity of people involved in grooming gangs, emphasizing the need to "keep calm" and accurately interrogate data. The government is expected to implement her 12 recommendations, including charging adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 with sexual assault, launching a national criminal operation, reviewing convictions of victims of child sexual exploitation, mandating ethnicity data collection, and commissioning research into the drivers of group-based child sexual exploitation.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the U.S. fell by 0.9% in May, exceeding expectations, due to declining gas sales and economic unease, according to the Commerce Department. Excluding autos, sales dropped by 0.3%, though the control group, excluding a series of items, increased by 0.4%. Building materials and gasoline stations saw sales declines, while online sales and furniture stores experienced gains, as Heather Long from Navy Federal Credit Union noted that families are becoming more selective with their spending. The pullback occurred despite improved consumer sentiment surveys, with the ongoing trade war and tariffs impacting consumer and business optimism, as GDP growth projections for the second quarter are expected to rebound after a first-quarter decline.

While other countries are implementing curbs on gambling advertising, Brazilian clubs heavily rely on gambling sponsorships, with all 20 first-division clubs displaying at least one gambling sponsor on their kits.

          <p>Retail sales in the United States experienced a sharp decline in May, largely attributed to consumers pulling back after a surge in spending in March to avoid President Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports. Sales at retail stores and restaurants dropped by 0.9% in May, following a 0.1% decrease in April, with a significant drop in auto sales. This decrease follows declines in consumer confidence earlier in the year, though inflation has cooled and unemployment remains low, which could potentially stabilize spending in the coming months. Sales also decreased at home and garden centers, electronics and appliance stores, and grocery stores, while online retailers, clothing stores, and furniture stores saw increases.</p>

The proposal depends on establishing a mayoral development corporation, granting planning powers, with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner expressing support. The plan has faced criticism regarding traffic diversion, impacts on bus routes, and the quality of retail offerings, but the mayor aims to rejuvenate Oxford Street and attract international visitors. Previous consultations showed varying levels of support from business owners, residents, and visitors, and the move has sparked debate over local democracy and the mayor's authority.</p>

          <p>Berlin is marking the 72nd anniversary of the East German uprising, where over a million people protested against the communist leadership in 1953 for democracy. At least 55 people were killed and 15,000 arrested during the violent crackdown, and Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner praised the "courageous women and men" who resisted the regime. Victims' commissioner Evelyn Zupke is releasing her annual report, highlighting the lasting trauma suffered by those persecuted under East Germany's dictatorship, underscoring the importance of defending freedom today.</p>

          <p>China has accused the US of "pouring oil" on the conflict between Israel and Iran, calling on all parties to de-escalate tensions, and particularly urging countries with influence over Israel to take immediate measures. William Figueroa, an expert on China-Middle East relations, suggests China's stance mirrors its approach to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, focusing on dialogue and de-escalation rather than military action. China lacks the capacity for power projection in the region and prefers to facilitate negotiations initiated from within the Middle East, as China sees this conflict as an arena where it can exercise influence. While the situation poses a risk to China's energy security, it is not considered a major threat due to diversified oil sources.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its upcoming meeting. The decision reflects ongoing caution from the Fed as it monitors the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs and economic policies. While consumer sentiment has improved, uncertainty remains, and the inflation rate ticked up slightly in May to 2.4%. Economists predict a 97.5% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady, with the meeting also including an economic forecast touching on future interest rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump also reiterated his stance that "IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON," while suggesting he was less interested in negotiating with Iranian leaders.

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace chemotherapy in some cases. ADCs deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy.

While challenges remain, such as controlling the release of the toxic payload and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins, the industry is working to overcome these issues through next-generation ADCs and combination regimens.</p>
