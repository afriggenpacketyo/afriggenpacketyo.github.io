          <p>The government is considering new regulations to address the housing crisis by reclaiming unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to meet deadlines. Housebuilders will be required to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports to local councils. Developers who repeatedly miss targets could lose their land, face penalties, and be denied future permissions. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized the government's support for builders and its commitment to accelerating housing construction to meet the target of 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis aiming to undermine Hamas. This system, run by foreign contractors and secured by a former C.I.A. officer, seeks to displace experienced aid agencies like the United Nations. The plan involves distributing aid from Israeli-controlled zones, bypassing the U.N., which Israeli officials distrust. Critics warn it could restrict aid, endanger civilians, and facilitate displacement. The project emerged from private meetings of Israeli officials, military officers, and business people, reflecting a broader strategy to influence Gaza's future.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's "Un Simple Accident," an Iranian film shot clandestinely, won the Palme dâ€™Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The film tracks a group seeking revenge on a man they believe tortured them in prison. This win capped a festival celebrated for its strong selections, countering earlier concerns about President Trump's proposed tariff on foreign-made movies. The jury, led by Juliette Binoche, also awarded a special prize to Bi Gan for "Resurrection," while Joachim Trier's "Sentimental Value" received the Grand Prix.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico, despite his fears of persecution. Judge Brian Murphy criticized the government for claiming the man did not fear deportation to Mexico, where he was previously sexually assaulted. The judge found that the man's deportation lacked due process, adding to a series of court findings against the administration's deportation policies. The man is now living in hiding in Guatemala, fearing for his safety.</p>

          <p>DMVs across the country are warning drivers of a new phishing scam targeting phones. The scam involves fake text messages warning drivers of unpaid fees on traffic violations and threatening penalties if they don't comply. These messages are designed to steal personal and financial information. Experts advise registering phone numbers to the National Do Not Call Registry, avoiding clicking links from unknown numbers, and remaining skeptical when personal information is requested.</p>
