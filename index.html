          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Turkey for potential talks aimed at ending the war, although Putin will not be attending. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed Washington's eagerness for progress toward a negotiated resolution and indicated openness to various mechanisms to achieve a lasting peace. President Trump, currently on a Gulf tour, stated his willingness to attend the talks if appropriate, emphasizing the need to stop the conflict. The upcoming discussions follow previous efforts, including the Istanbul Communiqué in March 2022, which sought Ukraine's neutrality in exchange for security guarantees.</p>

          <p>Marjut Hannonen, the EU's head of trade in Beijing, indicated that the European Union is not interested in reviving the stalled Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China, citing a deterioration in trade ties over the past two decades due to increasing barriers for businesses. Despite lobbying from Chinese officials, the EU has no intentions to resume negotiations on the investment deal. The European Parliament had previously delayed ratification of the agreement in 2021 due to concerns over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Recently, some sanctions were lifted, but the EU remains firm in its decision.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign minister stated that Berlin is willing to "follow" US President Trump's demand for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. This announcement comes amid discussions among NATO members about defense expenditure targets, with some countries considering 5% unrealistic. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has suggested a compromise involving increasing classic military spending to 3.5% and investing the remaining 1.5% in defense-related infrastructure. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that reaching the 5% target would be financially challenging.</p>

Reporters gathered outside Dolmabahce, an Ottoman palace in Istanbul, where previous talks took place in 2022, but no one seemed to know if the negotiations would occur or if the Ukrainian delegation was even in the city. The potential talks have been characterized by gamesmanship since their inception.</p>

          <p>Ola Aina, a teammate of Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi, asserts that Awoniyi's recent injury could have been avoided if the assistant referee had raised the offside flag earlier in the play. Awoniyi suffered a serious abdominal injury after colliding with a post during a match against Leicester City. Aina argues that Anthony Elanga was clearly offside in the lead-up to the incident, but the flag was delayed due to a protocol introduced in 2020, which allows play to continue until the phase is completed.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that customer complaints against U.S. airlines reached a record high in 2024, with significant issues including flight cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints, worst cancellation record, worst on-time arrival record, and worst record for involuntary bumping. Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian Airlines performed best in terms of overall complaints and flight cancellations. The report also noted that airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs compared to the previous year, but nationwide air traffic controller shortages could lead to more schedule disruptions in 2025.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that spending time in nature may help ease pain and promote recovery from physical injuries. Studies have shown that forest bathing and exposure to natural environments can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, while other research indicates that time in nature can benefit people suffering from physical pain or brain injuries. Experts say that nature gives the brain a break from the stresses of modern life, promoting restoration and emotional well-being, which can positively impact physical recovery. Regular walks and observation of nature can lead to a healthier relationship with the environment.</p>

          <p>Two British academics have discovered that a manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years, previously thought to be a copy, is an original 1300 version of Magna Carta. This rare document, one of only seven such originals in existence, was purchased for just $27.50 after World War II. The discovery was made by chance during research for a book, and its authenticity was confirmed through ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging. The document's value is hard to estimate, but it is a significant find given the historical importance of Magna Carta.</p>

          <p>The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a group of 21 economies including the U.S. and China, has cautioned about a potential sharp slowdown in their collective growth. The group forecasts growth to decrease to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year, attributing the decline to tariff tensions and policy uncertainty. Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit, Carlos Kuriyama, emphasized that the current environment is not conducive to trade, leading to delayed investments and new product launches. He stressed the need to restore confidence in trade by easing tensions and improving transparency in trade rules.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy has experienced significant growth due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate in the coming years but notes that potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports are unlikely to have a significant impact. Most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders. The IMF projects medium-term growth around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>
