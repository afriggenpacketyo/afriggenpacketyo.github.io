          <p>Daniel Park, a 32-year-old suspect connected to the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, died in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. Park was found unresponsive, and emergency services transported him to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead; the cause of death is currently unclear. Park had been indicted for alleged malicious destruction of property and was apprehended in Poland earlier this month after flying to Warsaw a few days after the bombing, and he was accused of shipping ammonium nitrate to the bomber, Guy Bartkus, who died in the blast. The FBI and U.S. Marshals Service have been notified, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that systemic failures at Boeing, including inadequate safety processes and an inexperienced workforce, led to the door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet in January 2024. Investigators were unable to identify who reinstalled the door plug without replacing four critical bolts. The NTSB highlighted that Boeing relied on a single point of failure, human error, and lacked proper documentation. While Boeing has made improvements since the incident, the NTSB emphasized the need for further safety enhancements, and the incident occurred as the plane was climbing to about 15,000 feet; had it happened at the plane's cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, the outcome could have been very different. </p>

          <p>French football club Lyon has been relegated to Ligue 2 due to the poor state of their finances, a decision made by the DNGC, the body overseeing French professional football clubs' accounts. Despite attempts to improve their financial situation through player sales and releasing high earners, Lyon officials failed to convince the DNGC of sufficient improvement. The club's owner, John Textor's Eagle Football Group, reported significant debts last October, and Lyon has the right to appeal the decision. If the relegation stands, Reims will replace Lyon in the top flight after being defeated in the relegation play-off by Metz.</p>

Closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday, and deliberations may begin the following Monday. Combs' defense moved for acquittal, claiming the government failed to prove the charges, and the judge reserved judgment on the motion. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts and faces a potential life sentence if convicted, with the core issue being whether he coerced women into sexual encounters with male sex workers.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is increasingly impacting rural areas in the United States, with over half of rural zip codes facing "high" heat vulnerability, affecting approximately 11.5 million Americans. Rural communities face unique challenges, including an older population, higher rates of chronic health conditions, and inadequate infrastructure such as older buildings with poor insulation and cooling systems. Rural residents often have lower incomes and are more vulnerable to power outages, while also lacking public spaces for relief. Addressing this issue requires infrastructure upgrades, healthcare investments, and policy changes to protect outdoor workers. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the interest earned on a $10,000 1-year CD versus a high-yield savings account, finding that the CD earns slightly more due to its fixed interest rate of 4.45% compared to the savings account's 4.30%. The CD guarantees $445 in interest, while the savings account's earnings could fluctuate due to variable rates. Money market accounts are also mentioned as a viable alternative, but they also carry the risk of variable interest rates. The key takeaway is that a CD provides a guaranteed return, but it requires keeping the money in the account for the full term. (not investment advice)</p>

Iran's size, population, and military capabilities make it a challenging target for intervention, and military action could trigger prolonged disorder and bloodshed.

Trump stated his desire for a deal with Russia and revealed that Putin had offered assistance with Iran, which Trump declined. European officials hope to leverage Trump's success in the Middle East to encourage a more aggressive stance toward Russia, and discussions at the NATO summit in The Hague have focused on Russia's timetable for reconstituting its land army.

          <p>This article compares the cost of a $50,000 home equity loan versus a $50,000 personal loan in June 2025, finding that the home equity loan is cheaper due to its lower interest rate. The average home equity loan rate is 8.25%, while the personal loan rate is 12.65%, resulting in a monthly savings of around $109 with the home equity loan. HELOCs are also discussed, but their variable rates make them a riskier option. The article concludes that a home equity loan is generally the better choice for those seeking lower, fixed payments.

          <h2>Heat Waves Deserve Recognition Similar to Storms</h2>

          <p>This article argues that heat waves, despite being deadly, lack the cultural memory and recognition afforded to storms. While storms like Hurricane Katrina are well-remembered, heat waves often fade into the background, despite causing significant fatalities. The author explores the idea of naming heat waves, similar to how tropical storms are named, to increase public awareness and encourage safety behaviors. However, the article acknowledges the challenges in implementing such a system due to the varying scale and temperature thresholds of heat waves, ultimately concluding that heat waves may remain anonymous for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, declined to commit to Article 5 of the NATO charter, the agreement on collective defense among NATO countries.

When asked to clarify his commitment to mutual defense, Trump stated that he is committed to saving lives and would provide an exact definition upon arrival at the summit.
