          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's redistricting initiative faces strong opposition from state Republicans, who allege they were given insufficient time to review the bill, claiming it disenfranchises Californians. A lawsuit has been filed in the state's Supreme Court to halt the legislative vote on the plan, which aims to eliminate five GOP congressional seats. Republicans argue the plan undermines voter-approved propositions that established an independent citizens' commission for redistricting. This article highlights the escalating political battle over electoral maps in California.</p>

          <p>The Royal Mint is releasing the last batch of £1 coins featuring the late Queen Elizabeth II, alongside new King Charles III coins, marking a significant transition in British coinage. Over 23 million Elizabeth II coins, dated 2021 and 2022, are entering circulation due to demand, with 2022 coins expected to be the rarest. This release symbolizes the monarchy's shift and encourages the public to look for the new designs, which feature British flora and fauna, as well as larger numbers for educational purposes. All coins bearing the late Queen's profile remain legal tender.</p>

          <p>New draft guidelines from NICE recommend a significant overhaul of type 2 diabetes care in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, advocating for more personalized treatment. The proposals suggest making newer medicines like SGLT-2 inhibitors the first-choice treatment for all patients, which could prevent severe complications and save lives. Additionally, around 750,000 more people with type 2 diabetes could be offered GLP-1 agonists, known for their weight-loss benefits.

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the Trump administration is negotiating a deal for the US government to take a 10% equity stake in Intel, potentially in exchange for government grants. This strategic move aims to bolster Intel's competitiveness against rivals and support the construction of a flagship manufacturing hub in Ohio. The Commerce Secretary indicated that the government seeks equity rather than merely issuing grants.

          <p>Walmart has initiated a recall of certain frozen shrimp products across 13 US states after a shipment tested positive for radioactive Cesium-137, as warned by the FDA. Although the contaminated sample did not enter US commerce, the recall is a precautionary measure, and consumers are advised to discard affected products. Prolonged exposure to Cesium-137 could elevate cancer risk, prompting the FDA to deny entry to several shipping containers from the Indonesian supplier. This article emphasizes public health safety measures in response to potential food contamination.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm but continues to pose a threat of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast, Atlantic Canada, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. Although not expected to make direct landfall in the US, North Carolina's Outer Banks face warnings of coastal flooding and mandatory evacuations. The storm's large size means its effects, including high waves and dangerous rip currents, will be felt across much of the Eastern Seaboard for several days.

          <p>Japan's exports in July plummeted by 2.6% year-on-year, marking their sharpest decline since February 2021, exceeding economists' forecasts. Shipments to its primary markets, the United States and China, saw significant reductions, with auto exports to the US particularly affected by a substantial 28.4% drop. This contraction in exports occurred despite stronger-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter, which was driven by net exports. The article suggests that recent tariff changes and production recovery from a March accident influenced these volatile trade figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A television advertisement for Sanex shower gel has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for reinforcing a racial stereotype. The ad depicted models with dark skin as having dry, cracked, or itchy skin, followed by a white woman with visibly smooth skin after using the product. The ASA ruled that this juxtaposition could be interpreted as suggesting white skin was superior to black skin, despite the manufacturer's claim of promoting diversity. This article highlights the importance of careful representation in advertising to avoid unintended discriminatory messages.</p>

Trump's claims, which he links to his unsubstantiated allegations of 2020 voter fraud, are deemed "wrong and dangerous" by election law experts.
