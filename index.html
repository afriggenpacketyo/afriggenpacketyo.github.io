            <p>China is actively engaging with the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to bolster trade relationships as tensions escalate with the United States. Recent discussions between Chinese and EU officials focused on electric vehicle pricing and investment in the automotive sector, indicating a move towards addressing trade frictions. China aims to establish a 'price undertaking' mechanism for EU-bound EVs, addressing subsidy concerns.

            <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could significantly increase the cost of raising children in America, affecting essential baby items such as cribs, strollers, and clothing. While Trump reversed some tariffs, he increased tariffs on China, and maintained a baseline tariff on other goods. Experts estimate that these tariffs could cost an average household thousands of dollars per year, placing a greater financial burden on families. This policy could contradict the administration's stated goals of encouraging higher birth rates in the U.S.</p>

The move aims to streamline the Cabinet Office, reduce duplication, and save £110 million annually by 2028.

            <p>A deal to end the Birmingham bin strike was allegedly stalled by interventions from the Unite union's national leadership, according to BBC sources. Some local Unite members reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the dispute, which has left thousands of tonnes of rubbish uncollected in the city. Senior Labour figures suggest a deal with local representatives could have been reached earlier, but was blocked by national figures. The industrial action has seen hundreds of Birmingham's refuse workers on strike since January.</p>

            <p>Lulu Gribbin, an Alabama teenager who survived a shark attack, is advocating for a new alert system to warn the public about shark attacks in the vicinity. Gribbin lost her left hand and part of her leg in the attack and believes an alert system could prevent future incidents. The proposed system, similar to Amber Alerts, would notify the public of unprovoked shark attacks. The Alabama House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee advanced the bill, highlighting the importance of public safety measures in coastal areas.</p>

            <p>Beijing's retaliatory tariffs have come into force, hours after Donald Trump paused steep levies on dozens of countries, except China. While Trump's announcement helped financial markets recover, the US tariffs against Chinese goods are at 125%, and the trade row does not appear likely to simmer down. The intensifying dispute could reduce trade in goods between the two countries by 80%. A China Daily editorial stated that “caving in to the US pressure is out of the question for Beijing”.</p>
