        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, hinting at possible concessions while maintaining some key demands. The plan includes no restrictions on Ukraine's military size and a European security contingent backed by the US to guarantee security, using frozen Russian assets for war damage repair. While it omits Ukraine fully regaining all territory or NATO membership, crucial sticking points for the Kremlin remain, such as military size and security guarantees. The plan's details emerge amidst ongoing Russian attacks and a planned, though uncertain, visit by President Zelensky to Pope Francis's funeral.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that listening to a minute of a special sound at 100 hertz may prevent motion sickness symptoms by stimulating the inner ear and improving balance. The study involved exposing volunteers to the sound before activities like riding on a swing or in a car, with 70-80% reporting alleviated symptoms. Researchers believe the sound activates the vestibular system through the otolithic organs. This finding could offer an alternative to medication for motion sickness, especially with the rise of self-driving vehicles.</p>

          <p>China is taking a tougher stance towards the Trump administration in his second term, reacting to US tariffs with countermeasures and assertive rhetoric. Unlike Trump's first term, there is no apparent prospect of a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Trump, with China attacking American "bullying" and seeking international support for its position. This shift may reflect a hardening of attitudes based on experiences during Trump's first term, indicating a more confrontational approach to trade and diplomacy.</p>
