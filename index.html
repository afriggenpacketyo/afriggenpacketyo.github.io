        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government hopes will stimulate economic growth. The privately-financed project aims to significantly increase flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 flights annually by the late 2030s, potentially doubling passenger numbers. Despite the government's support, the expansion faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions. The airport has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate some of these concerns.</p>

          <p>A memorial service was held for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed last week in Utah, drawing comments from political figures like Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. In an interview before the service, Kirk's wife, Erika, revealed she had urged him to take more safety precautions, a suggestion he reportedly rebuffed. Governor Shapiro, speaking on the morning of the memorial, condemned the act as part of a rise in political violence and called for national healing. He remembered Kirk as someone devoted to public debate, emphasizing that the answer to speech one disagrees with is more speech, not violence.</p>

          <p>Mandy Damari, the mother of a British-Israeli hostage who was held by Hamas for 15 months, has sharply criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. She argued that the move effectively rewards Hamas for its October 7th attack while hostages remain in captivity and the conflict is ongoing. Damari described the UK's pursuit of a two-state solution at this time as a "delusion" that emboldens the terrorist group. In response, Prime Minister Keir Starmer insisted the decision was not a reward for Hamas but an effort to revive hope for a peaceful, long-term resolution for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch, and likely his father Rupert Murdoch, will be part of the American investor group in a deal to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other prominent figures involved in the effort to save the app from a potential ban. The deal's structure is still being finalized, with the White House stating that Americans will hold a majority on the board and that Oracle will manage U.S. data and privacy. This development comes as negotiations continue between the U.S. and China over the future of the popular social media platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic shift, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state, aiming to build momentum for a two-state solution. The leaders of all three nations framed the move as a necessary step to revive hopes for peace, while explicitly stating it is not a reward for Hamas, which they affirmed can have no role in future governance. The announcement drew a swift and angry response from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established. This symbolic but historic decision places the three allies at odds with the United States' current position on the issue.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has asserted that recent Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace were not mistakes but part of an aggressive strategy to demonstrate NATO's weakness. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Macron described Russia as a destabilizing power, pointing to its intensified attacks on Kyiv and provocations along NATO's eastern flank. He stated that while he supports President Trump's diplomatic efforts to negotiate peace, Russian President Putin has shown no sincere willingness to engage. Macron called for increased sanctions and a military and economic surge to pressure Russia back to the negotiating table, while reaffirming European commitments to provide Ukraine with long-term security guarantees.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, made a plea for international investment and the lifting of economic sanctions to rebuild the war-torn country. Al-Sharaa, who led rebel forces that toppled the Assad regime, is set to address the United Nations, marking a significant moment for Syria on the world stage. He credited President Trump for taking a courageous step by waiving some sanctions and expressed a desire to meet with him to restore direct relations. Al-Sharaa defended his past actions by stating his forces confronted ISIS and expelled Iranian militias, arguing the international community had previously failed to protect Syrian civilians from the former regime's atrocities.</p>

The deceased victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare, who was dining with his family at the club's restaurant. Officials praised the heroic actions of other patrons who intervened, with one witness stating someone hit the shooter over the head with a chair, likely preventing further casualties.

          <p>According to multiple sources, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration shut down an investigation into "border czar" Tom Homan, who was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. The sting operation, which began during the Biden administration, reportedly captured Homan agreeing to potentially help agents posing as businessmen obtain government contracts if Trump won the 2024 election. The case was closed after Trump took office, with some officials reportedly questioning the legal viability of the charges. The White House has since called the probe a "blatantly political investigation," while the FBI Director and Deputy AG stated that a full review found no credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing.</p>

The direct appeal for the Justice Department to target his adversaries was immediately condemned by Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling it "the path to a dictatorship."

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director in the first Trump administration, stated that the U.S. job market has clearly degraded, a view he says is shared by the Federal Reserve. He pointed to recent data showing job creation has slowed from over 100,000 per month to less than 50,000, although he noted the downturn may be temporary. Cohn explained that companies, facing rising input costs from tariffs and unable to raise consumer prices, are cutting labor costs to protect their margins. This marks a shift from a post-COVID environment of labor hoarding to one where companies are aggressively managing expenses by letting their workforce decline naturally. (not investment advice)</p>

When asked about the new directive, Trump stated he did not believe the Pentagon should decide what reporters can cover, adding, "Nothing stops reporters. You know that." The new policy, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, requires journalists to pledge not to gather any unauthorized information, even if unclassified, or risk losing their press credentials. Press freedom advocates have condemned the move as a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint on publication, which is unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vehemently condemned the UK's decision to recognize a Palestinian state, calling it an "absurd prize for terrorism." In a statement, Netanyahu argued that such recognition rewards Hamas for its 2023 attack and endangers Israel's existence. The Israeli foreign ministry echoed this sentiment, claiming Hamas leaders view the diplomatic move as a direct result of the massacre. The strong rebuke comes as Israel faces growing international isolation over its handling of the war in Gaza. Domestically, however, Netanyahu's hardline stance is facing increased opposition, with tens of thousands demonstrating over the weekend for a deal to bring home the remaining hostages.</p>

The disappointing result was compounded by a failure to win any relay medals, another first since 2003.

He confirmed that he consulted his own players, who unanimously agreed they did not want to play for money, citing their purpose of inspiring the next generation as sufficient motivation.</p>

          <p>Amidst growing concerns over quality control in the aviation industry, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet is utilizing advanced smart factory technology to prevent errors. The facility integrates 5G wireless connectivity with a sophisticated network that connects every tool, robot, and worker, creating a unified intelligent system. This "sensing-transmission-control integration" aims to eliminate manual oversights, such as missing bolts or forgotten tools, which have plagued other manufacturers. By creating a single, intelligent feedback loop for the entire final assembly process, the Chinese-developed system represents a significant step forward in ensuring production quality and safety for its first domestically developed large passenger aircraft.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions requiring journalists to agree not to disclose any unauthorized information, even if it is unclassified, or they will risk losing access to the building. The policy is part of a broader effort to limit reporters' movements within the facility, which houses the Department of War. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated on social media that the press does not run the Pentagon and must follow the rules of a secure facility. Press freedom organizations have strongly condemned the new rules, calling them a "direct assault on independent journalism" and an affront to the First Amendment that could prevent public scrutiny of the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>Nineteen immigrant detainees are on a hunger strike at a new ICE processing center located within Louisiana's notorious Angola prison, according to advocacy groups. The strike, which entered its fifth day on Sunday, is a protest against conditions at the facility, which was recently opened by the Trump administration. The detainees are demanding access to medical care, prescription medications, basic hygiene supplies, and clean drinking water. Advocacy groups state that the reopening of the prison unit, formerly known as Camp J, has subjected detainees to unsafe and degrading conditions, including the denial of life-saving medication. They are calling for the facility to be shut down immediately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's public demands for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political rivals are viewed by some analysts as a sign of his concern over waning public support. This analysis suggests that with stalled job growth, rising grocery prices, and growing disapproval of his policies, Trump feels an urgent need to consolidate power before potential electoral losses in 2026. The article posits that officials like Bondi face a difficult calculation: weighing the benefits of pleasing the president now against the future legal risks if his power diminishes. This dynamic frames Trump's actions not just as political maneuvering, but as a high-stakes race to subvert democratic processes before public opinion turns decisively against him.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has slashed its budget for the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development by 8%, reducing it to just under €10 billion. Development Minister Reen Alabali Radovan acknowledged the cut of approximately €910 million comes at a time of increasing global crises. Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that the 50% reduction in German emergency aid alone will mean over 4 million people worldwide will no longer receive food assistance. The move is seen by critics as part of a broader trend of Western donor countries pulling back from financial commitments to the multilateral system.</p>

          <p>In a milestone event demonstrating decades of environmental progress, hundreds of people participated in the first official, organized swim in the Chicago River in nearly 100 years. Once a notoriously polluted waterway used as an open sewer for the city's slaughterhouses, the river has been dramatically cleaned up since the passage of the Clean Water Act in the 1970s. The event, which drew swimmers from across the U.S. and 13 other countries, symbolizes the transformation of the river from a toxic liability into a beloved recreational asset. The successful swim highlights how urban waterways can be restored, allowing cities to reconnect with the natural resources they were built upon.</p>

          <p>UCLA's interim football coach, Tim Skipper, is hiring veteran assistant Kevin Coyle to join the defensive staff for the remainder of the season. The move is intended to stabilize the team's defense following a difficult 0-3 start and the recent departure of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe. Coyle, 69, has extensive experience as a defensive coordinator at both the college and NFL levels, including a previous successful stint working with Skipper at Fresno State. The Bruins' defense has struggled significantly this season, ranking among the worst in major college football, and the hope is that Coyle's expertise will help orchestrate a much-needed turnaround as they begin conference play.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street strategists believe the stock market, which surged to new records after the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, may have more room to climb. Analysts suggest that the combination of easier financial conditions and the ongoing artificial intelligence boom is creating a favorable, if potentially fragile, environment for equities. Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors argued that today's S&P 500, with its high concentration of productive tech companies, justifies higher valuations than in the past. However, other experts caution that further rate cuts into a healthy economy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are considering ending their long-held opposition to national ID cards, a policy they were instrumental in blocking back in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, especially as the Labour government under Sir Keir Starmer is reportedly planning to introduce a digital ID scheme. Davey mentioned being impressed by Estonia's digital ID system, which he believes empowers individuals to access public services. The potential policy shift is divisive within the party, with many veteran members raising strong objections based on civil liberties, data security, and the risk of government overreach.</p>
