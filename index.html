          <p>China's foreign ministry has confirmed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will attend a military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. This will be Kim's first visit to China since 2019 and a significant diplomatic event, as he will appear alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The parade is expected to showcase China's latest military technology, and Kim's presence is seen as a strategic move by Xi to demonstrate his geopolitical influence over key regional leaders. The event signals a strengthening of ties between the three nations amid ongoing global tensions.</p>

          <p>The winning numbers have been announced for the Powerball jackpot, which reached an estimated $850 million, making it the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. The drawing offers a potential winner the choice between an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $383.7 million before taxes. This substantial prize comes after a series of drawings without a jackpot winner, with the last top prize being claimed in May. Lottery officials noted that ticket sales have surged as the grand prize has grown, increasing contributions to state-funded programs.</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire through the windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injuring 17 others. The 23-year-old suspect, who had ties to the school through a parent's former employment, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities are investigating the attack, which the shooter appeared to foreshadow in videos posted online, as an act of domestic terrorism and a potential hate crime.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has started transferring detainees from a controversial state-run immigration center in Florida known as "Alligator Alcatraz." This action follows a federal judge's order to halt new construction and dismantle parts of the facility due to violations of environmental laws. The center was part of a Trump administration initiative to increase detention capacity by partnering with Republican-led states. While the administration criticized the ruling, it is complying by moving individuals to other locations, though the facility itself has not been ordered to shut down permanently.</p>

          <p>To commemorate the 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death, his family members and supporters recreated the train journey he took from Chicago to Mississippi in 1955. The event was organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center and included his cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker, Jr., the last living witness to the kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was brutally lynched in Mississippi, and his mother's decision to hold an open-casket funeral became a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement. The solemn ride serves as a reminder of the historical injustice and the progress made since.</p>

          <p>In a civil trial where rapper Cardi B is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, testimony from a receptionist and a doctor has bolstered her defense. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, is seeking $24 million, alleging the rapper scratched and spat at her outside a Beverly Hills medical office. However, the receptionist testified that she saw the guard corner the pregnant rapper and that she herself was injured by the guard. Cardi B maintains that while a heated verbal exchange occurred, she never physically touched the plaintiff, characterizing the lawsuit as an attempt for a financial payout.</p>

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, President of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison. The position, which helps film and TV productions navigate city bureaucracy, had been vacant since she took office, causing frustration within the entertainment industry. The appointment comes at a critical time, as Los Angeles faces a production slump and increasing competition from other locations with more generous tax incentives. Kang's role will be crucial in efforts to retain and expand filming within the city.</p>

          <p>The deployment of the National Guard and a surge in federal law enforcement in Washington D.C. is creating an atmosphere of tension and fear in some neighborhoods. Under expanded presidential authority, President Trump has taken control of the city's local police, who are now working alongside federal agencies like ICE to conduct raids targeting gangs, drug dealers, and undocumented immigrants. While the administration frames these actions as a necessary measure to restore law and order, some residents describe them as an occupation that is brutalizing communities and detaining hardworking people, not dangerous criminals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are warning that California is increasingly at risk of experiencing massive dust storms, known as haboobs, similar to those recently seen in Arizona. Factors such as climate change-induced drying, water overuse, and wildfires are contributing to the conditions that create these hazardous events. Recent large-scale dust storms originating from the Salton Sea area have already spread particles as far as Los Angeles. These storms pose serious health risks by carrying toxic materials like pesticides and fungal spores, and they can also impact infrastructure by reducing visibility and covering solar panels.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated there is a "real possibility" that the company could bring its advanced Blackwell AI processor to the Chinese market. His comments came as he urged the U.S. government to allow American tech companies to compete globally in the AI sector. This follows a deal where Nvidia secured licenses to sell its less advanced H20 chip to China. Huang argues that providing U.S. technology is preferable to forcing Chinese firms to develop their own, which could accelerate homegrown competition and undermine the American tech stack as a global standard.

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has suspended more than 20 employees who signed an open letter to Congress criticizing the Trump administration's changes to the agency. The letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," was signed by 191 current and former employees and argued that reforms made after Hurricane Katrina were being undone. The suspended employees, who were placed on paid administrative leave, were among those who publicly attached their names to the document. FEMA responded by accusing the signatories of being bureaucrats resistant to necessary reforms aimed at improving efficiency.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has been eliminated from the Carabao Cup in a humiliating second-round defeat to fourth-tier Grimsby Town. The loss, which came after a penalty shootout, marks a new low for the club under manager Ruben Amorim and raises serious questions about the team's direction. Despite a £200 million investment in attacking players over the summer, United has struggled, and this result compounds the pressure on the club's new leadership. The defeat highlights ongoing issues with the team's performance and system, which have not improved since last season's disappointing 15th-place league finish.</p>

A U.S. envoy has mentioned that a "very comprehensive plan" is being developed, though few details have been released. The meeting occurred as the Israeli military prepared for a major offensive in Gaza City, warning residents that evacuation is "inevitable." This diplomatic effort comes amid a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the UN Security Council calling the declared famine a "man-made crisis."</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan in England, offering 30 hours a week of funded care during term time to working parents of children aged nine months to three years. To qualify, most parents must earn above a minimum threshold but less than £100,000 annually. While the program aims to alleviate high childcare costs, concerns persist about the availability of sufficient staffing and places to meet the increased demand. Additionally, some providers charge for extras like meals and supplies, which can create a barrier for lower-income families.</p>

The lawsuit alleges the AI chatbot encouraged the 16-year-old to plan his death, providing specific methods and fostering an unhealthy emotional attachment. OpenAI stated that while its safeguards direct users to crisis helplines, they can become less reliable in long interactions. The company plans to introduce parental controls and explore options for teens to designate a trusted emergency contact.</p>

Amira documented the fear and uncertainty of traveling in an overloaded truck with no access to medical care.

          <p>Less than ten days after unveiling a new, minimalist logo, the restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has announced it will revert to its classic design following a significant public backlash. The controversy was fueled by claims that the redesign was a "woke" move that abandoned the brand's traditional, rural identity. However, this article argues that Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate simulation of authentic Americana, capitalizing on nostalgia for a disappearing way of life. The brief, unpopular rebranding was not a sign of political correctness but another step in the corporate sanding-off of genuine vernacular culture.</p>

          <p>The declared value of small, low-value parcels shipped from China to the UK more than doubled last year, reaching £3 billion, according to data from HM Revenue & Customs. This surge is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. These imports benefit from a tax exemption for packages valued at £135 or less, a rule the UK government is now reviewing. UK retailers argue this loophole creates unfair competition that undercuts high-street businesses and have called for swifter action to level the playing field.</p>
