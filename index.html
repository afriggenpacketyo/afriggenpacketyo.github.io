          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has ended his re-election campaign, attributing his decision to "constant media speculation" and the denial of public matching funds. His withdrawal narrows the mayoral race to Democrat Zohran Mamdani, former governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who ran as an independent after a bribery and fraud indictment was dismissed, warned against "insidious forces" pushing "divisive agendas." His popularity had declined due to corruption allegations and immigration policy disagreements.</p>

Public Safety Minister Gary Anandasangaree stated the gang fostered a climate of fear and intimidation within Canadian diaspora communities. This designation follows allegations that Indian government agents utilized Bishnoi members for violent acts against pro-Khalistan supporters in Canada, which India denies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran is now under a "full, suffocating embargo" as UN sanctions snap back, severely impacting its weapons trade, oil exports, and international banking. This follows the UK, France, and Germany triggering the snapback mechanism due to Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. Analysts predict severe economic hardship, including currency collapse and high inflation, disproportionately affecting ordinary Iranians. Diplomatic avenues appear narrow, with Iran's leadership dismissing talks and risking further escalation, potentially even war, to maintain its hardline base.</p>

          <p>Lorenz Kraus, 53, confessed during a CBS affiliate interview to killing his elderly parents eight years ago and burying them in their Albany backyard. He described the acts as mercy killings for his frail parents, though they did not explicitly ask to die. Kraus was arrested immediately after the interview, charged with two counts of murder and two counts of concealment of a human corpse. The investigation began due to his parents' continued Social Security payments despite their disappearance. The unusual on-air confession shocked viewers and law enforcement.</p>

This article provides historical context, detailing 14 government shutdowns since 1980, from short lapses under Reagan to the 34-day shutdown in 2018. It explains that shutdowns occur when Congress fails to approve funding, leading to furloughs and potential mass layoffs.
