          <p>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has passed a motion at its party congress calling for constitutional bodies to prepare a case for banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The move follows the domestic intelligence agency's classification of the AfD as a "confirmed right-wing extremist" group, a designation currently under legal challenge. However, conservative partners in the coalition government, including members of the CDU/CSU, have urged caution, suggesting that the AfD should be countered through political means rather than an outright ban, which they fear could be difficult to justify in court.</p>

          <p>While India's property sector is currently experiencing a significant boom, a recent market analysis argues it cannot replace China's more fundamentally important role in the broader Asian real estate landscape. The article provides a stark contrast, detailing India's surge against China's severe and ongoing housing crisis, which has critically damaged investor confidence and resulted in falling prices and reduced investment. Despite a growing global investor interest in diversifying portfolios, mainland China and Hong Kong currently rank as the least-preferred commercial property markets in the Asia-Pacific region due to high vacancy rates.

          <p>Following the conclusion of this year's Glastonbury Festival, which was headlined by Olivia Rodrigo, thousands of attendees have begun their journey home from Worthy Farm. The end of the event marks the beginning of a major clean-up operation, with volunteers working to clear the site of rubbish and abandoned belongings. Organizers have urged festival-goers to take all their possessions with them to assist in the effort. The festival will now take a fallow year in 2026, with plans to return in 2027 after a period of rest and improvement for the land.</p>

          <p>A recent survey has revealed that Japan's same-sex partnership system, first introduced in 2015, is now available to 92.5 percent of the country's population. The system has been implemented by 530 local governments, though the certificates issued are not legally valid and do not confer the same rights as marriage, such as inheritance or spousal tax deductions. This widespread adoption comes as lawsuits across the country challenge the constitutionality of the national ban on same-sex marriage, with advocates highlighting the progress while continuing to push for full legal equality.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to release further details on concessions made to its proposed welfare reforms in an effort to prevent a significant rebellion from Labour MPs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was recently forced to amend the plans after over 120 of his own party's MPs threatened to vote against them. The concessions include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to only new claimants and reversing a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit. Despite these changes, some Labour MPs remain opposed, citing concerns over the remaining savings and potential poverty impact.</p>

          <p>A law enforcement group is highlighting a correlation between increased police budgets and a decline in homicide rates in several major US cities during the first quarter of 2025. Data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association shows that cities like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Denver, which all boosted police funding, saw significant year-to-date drops in murders. A spokesperson for the National Police Association described this trend as an "absolute rejection" of the 'defund the police' movement.

          <p>Republican leaders in the US are pushing to pass a massive legislative package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," before the Independence Day holiday, but face significant opposition from within their own party. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the measure after the Senate, where several GOP senators have already expressed dissent over its provisions, particularly changes to Medicaid. Senator Thom Tillis condemned the legislation, arguing it breaks President Trump's promises, while other conservative members have criticized the rushed process and lack of review time for the complex bill.

          <p>Sumo wrestler Onosato, recently promoted to the sport's highest rank of yokozuna, has stated his ambition to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament in his debut at this level. If successful, the 25-year-old would join a very small group of wrestlers who have achieved this feat. As the first Japanese-born yokozuna since 2017, Onosato is under a significant spotlight. He also hopes his success can bring energy and inspiration to his home region of Ishikawa, which was heavily impacted by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is facing a critical court decision that could declare its recent party congress null and void, thereby invalidating its entire reform-minded leadership. The legal challenge was brought by the party's former nationalist wing after they were defeated in an internal election by a new faction led by Ozgur Ozel and supported by Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Political analysts suggest the legal battle may be a strategic maneuver by President Erdogan to weaken and divide the increasingly popular opposition party ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>A columnist for The Guardian analyzes the racist and Islamophobic reaction to Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary, describing it as a 'collective self-induced hallucination.' The article details how politicians and public figures have spread anti-Muslim hate, labeling Mamdani an extremist and calling for his deportation, despite his progressive platform and condemnation of antisemitism. The author argues this backlash is not just about his religion, but also his challenging political stances on capitalism and Israel. The piece concludes that the intense reaction reveals the establishment's fear of marginalized views gaining majority support.</p>

The ambassador pushed back against accusations that Chinese nationals are the primary culprits behind the illegal mining operations. He argued that since Chinese nationals cannot obtain local mining licenses, they are often brought into the country by Ghanaian facilitators who enable the illicit activities. The ambassador described the perception that the Chinese are solely to blame as unfair to him and the majority of Chinese nationals in the country.</p>

          <p>A market analysis explains how British petroleum giant BP has become viewed as a potential takeover target for rivals like Shell, Chevron, and Exxon Mobil. The company's situation stems from its 2020 strategic pivot towards renewable energy under former CEO Bernard Looney, a move that has not impressed investors, leading to underperforming shares. Looney's abrupt departure in 2023 and declining profits further fueled speculation, despite the new CEO's efforts to reset the strategy by increasing investment in oil and gas. While Shell has denied acquisition talks, BP's vulnerability highlights the immense pressure on energy companies to balance transformation with performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK-US Trade Deal Takes Effect, Impacting Auto, Farming, and Steel Sectors</h2>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has officially taken effect, immediately lowering tariffs on British car exports from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles annually. This change is expected to restart vehicle shipments, which had paused due to the higher levies. However, the deal has drawn criticism from the UK farming industry, which feels it was used as a bargaining chip, and the steel sector still faces uncertainty as a promised zero-tariff agreement remains unfinalized. The business secretary also received assurances that automaker Lotus has no plans to close its UK plant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of anti-government protesters have blocked major roads in Belgrade and other Serbian cities, escalating their demonstrations against the populist government of President Aleksandar Vucic. The blockades followed a massive rally where an estimated 140,000 people called for snap elections and the president's removal from power. The protests were initially sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse in November, which has been widely blamed on government corruption and negligence. President Vucic has rejected the demands for an early election, accusing the student-led movement of causing "terror."</p>
