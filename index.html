          <p>A jury has found Labour councillor Ricky Jones not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory remarks at a counter-protest against a far-right rally. During the event, Jones called demonstrators "Nazi fascists" and made a throat-slitting gesture while saying they needed to be gotten "rid of." Mr. Jones, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, argued his comments were ill-advised but not intended to incite violence, a position the jury accepted after brief deliberations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to export certain advanced AI chips to China, but with a new 15 percent tax on the proceeds, a move some legal experts view as an unconstitutional export tax. The decision to allow the export of the powerful H20 chip, which was specifically designed to comply with US restrictions, is highly controversial. The article notes that some administration officials are reportedly considering resignation in protest over concerns it will undermine the U.S. competitive edge in AI.</p>

The extensive investigation began years ago after a minor car accident in Tennessee involving two drug dealers, which eventually led authorities to uncover a vast drug trafficking network stretching from Mexico to Atlanta. The case highlights how violent cartels supply drugs to American communities and the extensive efforts to dismantle their operations.</p>

The primary point of contention was whether the treaty should include legally binding caps on new plastic production, a measure opposed by oil-producing nations and the plastics industry. Despite significant progress, the deadlock means the world is still without a comprehensive global agreement to address the full lifecycle of plastics.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen significantly from their recent peaks, creating a favorable environment for homeowners with higher-interest loans to consider refinancing. The average 30-year fixed rate has dropped, driven by weakness in economic data that influences 10-year Treasury yields rather than direct Fed rate changes. Experts advise that homeowners with rates above 6% could see substantial savings, provided they plan to stay in their homes long enough to offset closing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool Football Club is planning an emotional tribute for their former forward Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a car crash last month at the age of 28. Jota's family is expected to attend the club's opening Premier League game, where a moment of silence will be observed and a fan-led mosaic will be unveiled. The players will wear shirts with a 'Forever 20' emblem for the season, honoring the number Jota wore when he helped the team win its 20th league title.</p>

          <p>The German government has strongly criticized Israel's plan to construct 3,400 new housing units in a controversial area of the occupied West Bank, labeling the move a violation of international law. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the construction would complicate a two-state solution and reiterated that Germany only recognizes the 1967 borders unless otherwise agreed upon by both parties. The plan, announced by Israel's far-right finance minister, has also drawn condemnation from the EU.</p>

          <p>Aid agencies are sounding the alarm over a growing humanitarian crisis in Myanmar's Rakhine State, where a military blockade has cut off food supplies and led to reports of starvation. The World Food Programme (WFP) has made an urgent appeal for donations, stating it can only feed a fraction of those in need due to funding shortfalls and access restrictions. The conflict between the military and the Arakan Army has trapped civilians, including Rohingya Muslims in displacement camps, in a cycle of hunger and despair.</p>

          <p>A research team from Tsinghua University in China has developed a new approach to the "single-source shortest-paths" problem, a fundamental challenge in computer science for over 40 years. Their method bypasses the speed limitations of the classic Dijkstra's algorithm by avoiding its time-consuming sorting process. The new technique, which focuses on key points to reduce calculation time, could lead to more efficient network routing and logistical planning, and their paper won the Best Paper Award at a major computing symposium.</p>

          <p>Olympic legend Michael Phelps has issued a sharp critique of USA Swimming, accusing its leadership of weakness and poor operational controls that have led to a decline in the program's success and culture. He points to a drop in the US team's medal share at the recent Olympics as evidence of systemic issues and states he would hesitate to let his own children join the system. Phelps is calling for an independent review and better athlete services ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer's fan code of conduct, which bans political displays, has created confusion and controversy, leading to the removal of fans wearing MAGA hats and others holding anti-ICE banners. The policy puts MLS at odds with global soccer norms and highlights the challenge of defining "political" speech, especially when it intersects with human rights issues. The league defends the rule as a necessary measure for safety and risk management in a politically charged era.</p>

          <p>Residents of the predominantly Latino neighborhood of Denver Harbor in Houston express anxiety over a Republican-led plan to redraw congressional maps. They fear their community will be moved into a more conservative district, diluting their political influence and leading to neglect of local issues like pollution and immigration enforcement. The move is part of a broader, controversial effort by President Trump to create more GOP-held seats in Texas, prompting Democratic lawmakers to protest by leaving the state.</p>
