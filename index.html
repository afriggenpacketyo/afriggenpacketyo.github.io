          <p>An internal agency memo reveals the extent of the recent attack on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, where a gunman fired over 180 rounds, breaking approximately 150 windows. The shooter, who reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his mental health issues, killed a police officer before being stopped and later dying. The incident has prompted CDC employees to work from home and raised concerns among officials about the long-term impact of anti-vaccine rhetoric on the safety of public health workers.</p>

          <p>Residents of Paterson, New Jersey, are entering their fourth day with little to no water service after a 140-year-old water main broke on Friday. The break has left thousands under a boil water advisory and forced many to rely on bottled water and portable facilities. Officials now estimate that repairs, which require custom-made pipes, should be completed by Tuesday night, though the advisory will likely last until at least Friday. The situation has caused significant frustration for the nearly 160,000 residents of the city.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Jennifer Aniston reflected on the intense tabloid coverage of her 2005 split from ex-husband Brad Pitt, describing it as a "vulnerable time" where the public narrative became like a soap opera for people. She recalled taking the media storm personally, as it coincided with Pitt's widely publicized relationship with Angelina Jolie. Aniston, now 56, acknowledged the difficulty of navigating such a personal crisis under intense public scrutiny but noted that she ultimately had to pick herself up and move forward.</p>

          <p>Ahead of upcoming talks between the U.S. and Russian presidents, European Union foreign ministers have convened to assert their position that any peace agreement concerning the war in Ukraine must involve Kyiv. The EU leaders are firm that a deal cannot be imposed upon Ukraine without its participation and consent at the negotiating table. This meeting highlights Europe's concerns about being sidelined in major geopolitical decisions that directly affect the continent's security and the sovereignty of its allies.

          <p>Forecasters announced the formation of Tropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean on Monday, noting it could strengthen into the season's first hurricane later in the week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands and is currently moving west, with early models projecting it to become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its development marks the fifth named storm of an Atlantic hurricane season predicted to be above-normal.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger is investigating the recent $5 million sale of the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, suspecting it was smuggled out of the country. The 54-pound meteorite was discovered in the Sahara Desert in November 2023 and sold at a New York auction, but Nigerien officials claim this may constitute "illicit international trafficking." In response, the nation's president has suspended the export of all precious stones and meteorites.

The author contends that the move recycles old rhetoric linking race to criminality and establishes a precedent for using the military for domestic policing in other cities with large minority populations, such as Chicago and Oakland. The article suggests this action is not about law and order, as crime rates are falling, but is a test case for a broader, unconstitutional use of military force on American streets.</p>

          <h2>Myanmar Quake Study Suggests Next San Andreas 'Big One' May Be Unpredictable</h2>

          <p>A study of a massive March earthquake in Myanmar suggests that the next major quake on California's San Andreas fault may not follow expected patterns. Researchers found that the magnitude 7.7 Myanmar quake ruptured a much longer section of a similar fault than anticipated, indicating that seismic events don't repeat themselves exactly. This implies that California's next "Big One" could be larger or smaller than historical events like the 1857 or 1906 quakes, and that faults can behave in surprising ways, making precise prediction difficult.</p>

          <p>This article explains the legal basis for President Trump's move to place the Washington, D.C. police under federal control. The action invokes Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants the president authority to direct the city's police force for federal purposes deemed necessary during special emergencies. This control is limited to 30 days unless extended by Congress. The move has been criticized by D.C. officials and Democrats as an assault on local autonomy, reigniting calls for D.C. statehood to protect it from federal overreach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the U.S. Supreme Court is to blame for the current crisis over partisan gerrymandering, citing its 2019 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause. The ruling declared that challenges to partisan gerrymandering were a "political question" that federal courts could not decide, effectively opening the door for states like Texas to redraw districts for purely political gain. The author contends that this has undermined democracy by allowing representatives to choose their voters, and suggests that states with independent commissions may now be forced to gerrymander in response.</p>

          <p>This article argues that new laws requiring age verification and facial recognition for online services, such as the UK's Online Safety Act, create a false sense of security while undermining privacy. The author, an anti-surveillance advocate, demonstrates how he easily fooled a dating app's verification with a static photo, highlighting the system's flaws. The piece contends that these mandates are easily circumvented, force users to surrender anonymity, and create massive, vulnerable databases of personal information, ultimately making the internet less safe and more centralized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests the global transition to clean energy could face significant shortages of at least 12 key minerals by 2100, raising concerns about a potential "peak mineral" crisis. However, this analysis argues that such fears may be overstated, much like the "peak oil" theory of the past. Rapid technological innovation is already creating substitutes for critical materials like cobalt and silver, and new battery chemistries are reducing reliance on lithium. The article suggests that market forces, government intervention, and continued innovation will likely adapt to shifting mineral needs.</p>

          <p>A Romanian citizen who overstayed his visa has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in a scheme that stole food aid funds from thousands of low-income Californians. The man used sophisticated skimming devices on ATMs to capture EBT card information, which was then used to create fraudulent cards and withdraw cash aid. At his arrest, he possessed nearly 1,500 stolen account numbers and over $37,000 in cash. In response to such fraud, California has begun rolling out new EBT cards with microchips to enhance security.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether gold is a suitable investment for beginners, especially in the current economic climate of rising inflation and market volatility. It advises new investors to consider three key factors: their short-term financial goals, the price volatility of gold, and their need for a portfolio diversifier. While gold can act as a hedge against inflation, its high price and lack of income generation may make it less suitable for those just starting to build savings. The article suggests that a small, strategic allocation could be beneficial for long-term diversification. (not investment advice)</p>
