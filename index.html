          <p>Venezuelans are participating in elections for lawmakers and governors, despite widespread government repression and a call for a boycott from the main opposition party. The vote marks the first major electoral event since last year's presidential election, which was marred by credible evidence of fraud. The opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado, views the election as a "parody" to legitimize President Maduro's rule, while a smaller faction argues that abstaining only strengthens Maduro's control.

          <p>The Trump administration has been criticized for monetizing the presidency to an unprecedented extent, normalizing activities that would have previously sparked outrage and investigations. Examples include Melania Trump's promotional film deal, fees from a new cryptocurrency, overseas real estate ventures, and the establishment of an exclusive club in Washington. The receipt of a luxury jet from Qatar for the president's use, even after leaving office, highlights the scale of these financial dealings. Critics argue that the administration has dismantled ethical boundaries and accountability measures, leading to a normalization of corruption and a lack of official scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the Black Lives Matter movement faces a significant backlash, marked by the removal of symbols and a shift in racial discourse led by President Trump. The Justice Department has curtailed oversight of police forces, and there is a resurgence of "white grievance" politics. While the movement sparked widespread protests and commitments to change, progress has been uneven, and public support has waned. Despite these challenges, some argue that the movement has had lasting impacts, including police reform measures and increased awareness of racial inequality, though the fight for racial justice continues.</p>

Democrats are reassessing their messaging and strategies to regain support, particularly among working-class voters and in rural areas.

          <p>An essay explores the decline of deep male friendships in America, noting that men today report having fewer close friends compared to previous generations. The author reflects on his own experiences, highlighting the intensity and emotional intimacy he once shared with male friends, which has diminished over time. The article attributes this decline to societal expectations around masculinity, which discourage emotional vulnerability and prioritize romantic relationships and family over friendships. The piece suggests that a shift towards more open and expressive male friendships could improve men's overall well-being.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder, challenging the notion that the Defund the Police movement failed. It argues that despite setbacks like unsuccessful ballot amendments, the movement significantly shifted public opinion and political discourse, bringing radical ideas into the mainstream. The piece highlights that the movement achieved over $840 million in cuts from US police departments and $160 million in investments in community services, with numerous cities reducing their police budgets or removing police from schools. The author stresses that systemic change takes time and perseverance, urging unity and continued fighting for justice in the face of ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>A drone unit in Russian-occupied Ukraine, known as Kaskad, is offering Russian officials a fast track to career advancement through short, relatively safe deployments.

The practice has drawn criticism for creating a two-tiered system within the military, where elite figures can boost their careers without significant risk.
