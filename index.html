          <p>A federal immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil to either Syria or Algeria, citing his failure to disclose certain affiliations on his green card application. The judge's decision highlighted Khalil's internship with a UN agency and his ties to an anti-Israel campus coalition as deliberate omissions. Khalil, who was arrested in March and detained for over three months, argues the government's actions are retaliation for his political speech. His legal team has announced their intention to appeal the ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has announced a partnership with over 40 conservative organizations, including the America First Policy Institute and The Heritage Foundation, to develop civics programming for the nation's 250th anniversary. The initiative, named the America 250 Civics Education Coalition, aims to renew patriotism and strengthen civic knowledge among youth. While specific educational materials have not yet been detailed, planned activities include a 50-state college campus speaking tour. The move comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal role in education, despite laws prohibiting federal control over school curriculum.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate, Asian markets showed mixed results, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index surging to a new record high. The Fed's move was framed as a "risk management cut," with indications of further reductions possible this year. While Japanese and South Korean markets saw gains, Australian and Chinese indexes slipped. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy rates in its upcoming meeting, as investors worldwide digest the implications of the Fed's policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the U.K. was highlighted by a grand state banquet held in St George's Hall at Windsor Castle, a key diplomatic event designed to honor the visiting leader. The guest list was notably heavy on political figures and technology executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, rather than celebrities. The elaborate event featured a 47-meter-long dining table where President Trump was seated between King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales. The menu and musical selections were carefully curated, reportedly including some of the president's favorite pieces.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The declaration, made on social media, also included a recommendation to investigate individuals and organizations that allegedly provide funding. This move follows a similar, unfulfilled threat from his first term and comes in the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The president and his allies have increasingly focused on what they term "radical left political violence," though the legal and practical implications of such a designation remain unclear.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume fruit with a low alcohol content, equivalent to about two human cocktails per day. Researchers measured the ethanol levels in figs and plum-like fruits that are a staple of the chimps' diet, providing the first direct chemical evidence of their alcohol intake. This finding supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of primate ancestors. The steady, low-dose exposure does not appear to intoxicate the animals.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming on October 1, congressional Democrats have released a counteroffer to the Republican funding plan, which is already advancing in the House. The Democratic proposal would fund the government until October 31 and permanently extend enhanced health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. In contrast, the GOP plan funds the government until November 21 and includes security funding but omits the health subsidies. Republican leaders have rejected including the subsidies, setting the stage for a contentious negotiation as the deadline to avert a shutdown rapidly approaches.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has advised against scrapping the current system of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs. Instead, the committee recommends establishing new national minimum standards for support in schools and providing more training for teachers to ensure early and effective intervention. This comes as the government prepares to announce reforms to the financially strained special needs system. Parent advocacy groups have strongly supported keeping the legally-binding EHCPs, viewing them as a critical backstop for ensuring their children receive necessary support.</p>

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California, alongside Louisiana, continues to have the highest poverty rate in the nation, with little improvement since 2023. Approximately 17.7% of residents, or 7 million people, could not afford basic needs in 2024. The report attributes the stubbornly high rate to the expiration of pandemic-era support policies like the federal child tax credit, which had previously led to historic lows in poverty. Researchers warn that recent federal and state budget cuts to social safety net programs are likely to exacerbate the problem.</p>

However, Newsom's office clarified that an emergency order from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass currently bans applications for new duplexes and lot splits in the burn zone.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has enacted a 0.25% interest rate cut, a moderate move aimed at balancing weak jobs reports against inflation concerns. This decision is unlikely to satisfy President Trump, who has been aggressively pressuring the central bank for more significant cuts and has attempted to oust a Biden-appointed board member. The situation is further complicated by the recent appointment of Stephen Miran, a Trump administration official, to the Fed board. While the modest cut demonstrates the Fed's current independence, the sustained political pressure raises concerns about its long-term autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts widely anticipate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting.

With official data showing inflation remaining at 3.8%, nearly double the 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut that could fuel further price rises.
