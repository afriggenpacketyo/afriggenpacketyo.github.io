          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have initiated a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in parts of Gaza, including Gaza City and Deir al Balah, to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid. This decision, coordinated with the United Nations and other international groups, establishes secure corridors for aid convoys to deliver food and medicine amid a worsening malnutrition crisis. The pause will occur for 10 hours each day until further notice. Hamas-run health officials in Gaza have urged that the pause be used to evacuate the wounded and distribute essential supplies like baby formula and antibiotics.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to discuss the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza during his meeting with US President Donald Trump. The discussion comes as aid agencies warn of mass starvation in the territory and after ceasefire negotiations in Qatar stalled. The UK government is also working with Jordan to airdrop aid and is accelerating efforts to evacuate critically ill children. A government minister described the situation as "utterly horrifying," emphasizing that starvation must not be used as a weapon of war and calling for Israel to lift restrictions on aid.</p>

          <p>Oakland's historic Chinatown, which has endured the pandemic and anti-Asian violence, is now facing a new economic challenge from US tariffs on Chinese goods. Local merchants report that while customer traffic remains, consumer spending on imported items like specialty foods and furniture has significantly declined. One long-time supermarket owner stated that the tariffs have increased costs by an average of 50%, forcing customers to cut back on their purchases. The situation highlights the direct impact of international trade policy on small, community-focused businesses in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Wyandotte County Sheriff's deputy was killed in the line of duty after being shot by a suspect who had barricaded himself inside a residence. Deputy Elijah Ming, a nearly nine-year veteran of the agency, was responding to a civil standby call when the suspect opened fire. The suspect later exited the house and was taken into custody by a police force that included the Kansas City, Kansas police department. Local officials and community leaders expressed their condolences to Deputy Ming's family, describing the loss as a result of senseless violence.</p>

          <p>During a visit to his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, US President Donald Trump is set to meet with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss transatlantic trade relations. The meeting is critical as it could determine whether a new trade agreement is reached or if a trade war ensues with threatened US tariffs on EU goods. Trump has also scheduled meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scotland's First Minister John Swinney. The visit is accompanied by a major security operation and has drawn both small groups of supporters and larger protests in nearby cities.</p>

          <p>This article laments the decline of comprehensive event listings in major publications like The New York Times and The Village Voice, which once served as vital guides to a city's cultural scene. The author argues that this shift, driven by changing media economics and a focus on already-popular subjects, has weakened subcultures and made it harder for emerging artists to find an audience. Without these curated guides, cultural discovery is now dominated by algorithms that reinforce existing tastes rather than exposing people to new experiences. The loss of listings represents a loss of a shared cultural record and a crucial ecosystem for artistic development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of tipping in the US, tracing it back to the post-Civil War era when employers sought to avoid paying wages to formerly enslaved Black workers in the service industry. The practice established a system where customers, rather than employers, were responsible for a significant portion of a worker's income. This led to the creation of the federal tipped minimum wage, which currently stands at just $2.13 per hour, a figure unchanged since 1991. The National Restaurant Association has historically lobbied to maintain this system, which critics argue is a direct legacy of discriminatory labor practices.</p>

The statement reflects Beijing's ongoing political pressure on Taiwan, which has intensified since the election of President William Lai Ching-te, whom Beijing views as a separatist.

The anxiety spans generations, affecting millennials struggling to start families and older Americans unable to retire as planned.

Birte Pfleger, a history professor, expressed her conflicted feelings, acknowledging her pain but also criticizing the denial of constitutional due process for Nilakout and others deported under the Trump administration's policy. The policy allows for deporting individuals to third-party countries with little notice, an action the UN human rights office has condemned.

          <p>Sinkholes are reportedly becoming more frequent globally, with research suggesting a link to climate change. Scientists explain that intensified weather patterns, such as severe droughts followed by heavy rainfall, are exacerbating the natural process of ground collapse in susceptible areas. Droughts lower the water table, weakening subterranean support, and subsequent intense rain adds weight that can trigger a collapse. Regions like Turkey's Konya Plain have seen a dramatic increase in sinkhole formations as groundwater levels drop due to both climate change and increased water pumping for agriculture.</p>

They contend that denying this entanglement leaves science vulnerable to political attacks and allows it to be used to undermine marginalized groups.

          <p>This article details the profound changes along the U.S.-Mexico border under the Trump administration, where migrant crossings have plummeted to their lowest levels in decades. Policies such as a ban on asylum, mass deportations, and border militarization have created a climate of fear, leading some migrants already in the U.S. to "self-deport" back to Mexico. Shelters in border cities like Ciudad Juárez are now largely empty, and the regional economy is suffering from factory layoffs due to tariff uncertainty. The report paints a picture of a border transformed from a place of risk and opportunity into one of despair and economic stagnation.</p>

          <p>Two columnists debate the merits of California Governor Gavin Newsom's threat to gerrymander the state's congressional districts in retaliation for a similar move by Republicans in Texas. One columnist argues against the idea, stating it would ignore the will of California voters who established an independent commission and could lead to unintended negative consequences, akin to past political rule changes. The other columnist contends that in the face of a potential democratic crisis, gerrymandering could be a form of "peaceful resistance" to counter authoritarian trends. The discussion frames the issue as a choice between upholding principles and using pragmatic, hardball tactics in a high-stakes political moment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the nickname "Alligator Alcatraz" for a Florida immigrant detention center is rooted in a dark history of American racism, specifically the post-Civil War trope of using Black babies as "alligator bait." The author contends that this historical slur, which was popularized on postcards and in products, served to dehumanize Black people and justify violence against them. Similarly, the term "Alligator Alcatraz" uses mocking humor to dehumanize immigrants, frame them as dangerous criminals, and manufacture consent for cruel treatment. The piece asserts that this rebranding of old cruelty for a new target is a tactic to make state-sanctioned violence seem palatable and even necessary.</p>

          <p>This article examines why Poland was the only Eastern European nation at the Women's Euro 2025, in stark contrast to the region's strong representation in men's football. Experts point to a combination of cultural, political, and economic factors, including societal norms that discourage girls from playing football and a history of underinvestment in the women's game. The collapse of state-sponsorship after the fall of communism created financial struggles, and the more recent rise of right-wing politics has reinforced traditional gender roles. Despite these challenges, there is hope that increased UEFA investment and the growing visibility of women's tournaments will foster development.</p>

          <p>While residents in Gaza have cautiously welcomed Israel's plan for a temporary humanitarian pause to allow aid entry, many express fear that it will not be enough to solve the deepening crisis. After months of extreme shortages of food, water, and medicine, Gazans say a few aid convoys are insufficient and call for a lasting solution and an end to the war. The report highlights the severe impact of malnutrition, particularly on children and those with specific health needs like celiac disease, who cannot consume the wheat-based products that form the bulk of available food. The sentiment is one of temporary relief mixed with despair.</p>

          <p>This article details how comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, along with the creators of South Park, have recently pushed back against perceived censorship and corporate pressure. The pushback followed the cancellation of Colbert's "The Late Show" by Paramount-owned CBS, a move that raised questions about its timing relative to the approval of a major Paramount merger. Stewart delivered a blistering monologue on "The Daily Show," while "South Park" launched its new season with a savage satire of President Trump and the Colbert cancellation. The events highlight how satirists can use their platforms to immediately and dramatically show their independence and refusal to be intimidated.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why US stock markets have been hitting record highs despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs. Key factors include a resilient economy with a strong labor market and corporate earnings that have proven sturdier than expected. Furthermore, investors seem to believe Trump's bark is worse than his bite, a theory dubbed the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out), as he has often delayed or reduced initially announced tariffs. However, fears remain that the market is priced for perfection and vulnerable to a pullback, given the unresolved trade disputes and the eventual economic impact of higher import costs.
