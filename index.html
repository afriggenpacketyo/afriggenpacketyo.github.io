          <p>In this guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig discusses her obsession with zombie fiction, particularly the HBO series "The Last of Us," as a means of distracting herself from real-world anxieties. She finds that immersing herself in a fictional apocalypse provides a temporary escape from the more mundane, yet still troubling, aspects of everyday life. Feintzeig draws a parallel to her experience using horror movies to cope with grief after a miscarriage, noting that confronting fictional horrors can sometimes alleviate the burden of real-life struggles. The author humorously acknowledges the absurdity of her coping mechanism, yet finds solace in the temporary relief it offers.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass anxiety to their canine companions. Researchers found that when owners dwell on work problems after hours, their dogs show more signs of stress, such as whining, pacing, and restlessness. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," highlights the emotional connection between humans and their pets. The study suggests that employed dog owners may benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect the well-being of their dogs.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government. The government aims to improve services and reinvest profits in infrastructure, though lower fares aren't guaranteed. Unions have raised concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on its promises. SWR trains are now the responsibility of DfT Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>
