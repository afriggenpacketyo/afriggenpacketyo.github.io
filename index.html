          <p>Elon Musk concluded his tenure as a special government employee, with President Trump praising his work in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk's initial promise was to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, the White House reports savings of roughly $170 billion. However, an analysis suggests DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity. Musk defended DOGE's work, expressing confidence in achieving the $1 trillion goal over time, while also noting his disappointment with a recent spending bill that increases the budget deficit. The article presents a balanced view of Musk's contributions and the criticisms surrounding DOGE's initiatives.</p>

          <p>Representative Greg Steube of Florida has introduced "The Make Autorail Great Again (MAGA) Act," proposing to rename Washington, D.C.'s transit authority (WMATA) to WMAGA in honor of President Trump. The bill seeks to withhold $150 million in federal funding until WMATA adopts the new name and rebrands the METRO rail system as the "Trump Train." Steube argues that WMATA, a struggling institution, needs a fresh identity, particularly with upcoming global events in the region. While some METRO stations already bear political names, renaming the entire system after a dignitary is unprecedented.
