The construction is for a new, privately funded ballroom championed by President Donald Trump.

          <p>Gold and silver prices experienced their most significant single-day drop in years, bringing a halt to their recent record-breaking rally. Gold futures fell by as much as 5.5%, while silver tumbled over 7%, with analysts attributing the slide to easing trade tensions, a stronger U.S. dollar, and overbought market conditions. Despite the sharp correction, many experts remain bullish on the long-term prospects for precious metals, citing persistent inflation and geopolitical instability as supportive factors.

          <p>During a visit to Israel, Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is progressing better than he had anticipated, despite recent outbreaks of violence. He urged patience as both sides transition from intense warfare to a peacetime posture, acknowledging the difficulties in securing the remains of all hostages. However, some analysts express skepticism about the long-term viability of the peace plan, questioning both parties' commitment to its core tenets, including the disarmament of Hamas.</p>

          <p>Despite the federal government shutdown, student loan borrowers can still access essential services and support. While the Department of Education is closed, government contractors who service the loans remain operational, allowing borrowers to continue making payments and process applications for forbearance or deferment. Additionally, the Studentaid.gov website is still available for tasks like applying for new repayment plans or loan consolidations, though final approvals for some programs may be delayed.</p>

          <p>After more than ten years on death row in Indonesia, British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford is set to be repatriated to the U.K. following a diplomatic agreement. Sandiford, who is now in her late 60s and reportedly in poor health, was sentenced to death in 2013 for drug trafficking. Her transfer, along with that of another British national, represents a significant humanitarian development, as Indonesia has some of the strictest drug laws in the world and rarely grants such concessions.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Raoul Peck's new documentary, "Orwell: 2+2=5," critically examines the legacy of George Orwell's novel "1984" and its relevance today. The film argues that while society has become adept at recognizing "Orwellian" tactics like propaganda and the suppression of truth, this recognition has led to complacency rather than resistance. Using Orwell's own writings and archival footage, the documentary makes the case that the very warnings from his dystopian masterpiece have been normalized in modern political discourse.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that neglect at a mental health unit in Manchester contributed to the death of 22-year-old patient Cerys Lupton-Jones. The inquest found that staff had falsified observation records, claiming she was safe when she was in fact in a toilet where she fatally harmed herself. The coroner described the care provided as a "shambles" and a "gross failure," highlighting a systemic breakdown in basic medical attention for a highly vulnerable individual in a dependent position.</p>
