          <p>Shedeur Sanders, the highly touted quarterback and son of Deion Sanders, experienced a surprising slide in the NFL draft, remaining unselected after three rounds. Despite being considered a first-round talent by many, concerns about his sack rate, arm strength, and adaptability to a non-family coaching environment emerged. Several quarterbacks projected to be picked later were chosen before Sanders, leading to controversy and debate among analysts and fans. The slide prompted reactions from figures like Patrick Mahomes and Donald Trump, highlighting the unexpected turn of events for the young quarterback.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, the issue of national unity is a key topic in the federal election, with some residents advocating for separation from Canada or even joining the United States. This sentiment stems from a feeling of "western alienation," where Albertans believe their region is overlooked by politicians in Ottawa, particularly concerning environmental policies affecting the oil and gas industry. Premier Danielle Smith has warned of a "national unity crisis" if Alberta's demands are not met by the new prime minister, highlighting the growing divide between eastern and western Canada.</p>

The Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, and the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, also play significant roles in the election.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's leadership has developed a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, which has faced criticism for potentially conceding too much to Russia.

          <p>The Justice Department has revoked a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, allowing authorities to use subpoenas and compel testimony from reporters. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that federal employees leaking sensitive information undermines the DOJ's ability to uphold the rule of law. The policy allows for subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists, subject to DOJ leadership approval and advance notice. This move marks a shift towards a more aggressive approach to leak investigations.</p>

While the Kremlin described the talks as "constructive", Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the need for "real pressure on Russia" to accept an unconditional ceasefire. Reports suggest the US peace proposal involves Ukraine ceding territory to Russia, a condition Zelensky rejects.</p>

This contrasts with the initial summit between Xi Jinping and Trump in 2017, which aimed to build rapport. China's hardened attitude may stem from its experiences during Trump's first term.
