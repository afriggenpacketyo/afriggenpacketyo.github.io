Analysts note the dispersed force strategy and grid pattern contribute to the base's survivability, posing an asymmetrical threat to the Chinese mainland.

Historically, tariffs have been central to US trade policy, evolving from revenue generation to protectionism. Today, President Trump uses the term "reciprocal tariffs," but the application doesn't always align with historical definitions, signaling a semantic broadening. This evolution highlights how political buzzwords can shift in meaning and carry loaded connotations. Understanding the historical context of tariffs is essential for interpreting their current use in political discourse.</p>

            <p>Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice scored two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final match against Real Madrid. It was his first free-kick goal in his professional career, after 338 games. The second goal was especially sensational and left Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard and manager Mikel Arteta with their hands on their heads in disbelief. Former Real Madrid and Brazil defender Roberto Carlos was seen looking glum-faced in the stands.</p>

            <p>The wealthy Arab Gulf states are better positioned to manage the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. However, a shaky outlook for the price of oil could put some countries' budgets and spending projects at risk. Warm relations with Trump strengthen the region's hand when it comes to potential tariff negotiations. A lower oil price, however, can significantly impact the budget deficits and spending plans for those countries, whose economies still rely heavily on hydrocarbon revenues.

Kim Yo Jong insisted that any external discussions of denuclearization amount to a denial of her country’s sovereignty.

            <p>Some Chinese exporters are reportedly abandoning shipments mid-voyage to avoid crushing tariff costs imposed by the Trump administration. The move has been dubbed “preparing for the Long March,” a metaphor for a prolonged downturn in cross-Pacific trade. One export company's US-bound container volume has plummeted, leading to halted shipping plans and scrapped orders. One client told the company it was abandoning goods already on the water and giving them to the shipping company, as “no one will buy them after the tariffs are imposed.”</p>

            <p>President Trump's latest sweeping tariffs against America's trading partners have taken effect. Goods imported from the 60 countries which he describes as the "worst offenders" are now subject to additional taxes ranging from 20% to 104% for Chinese products. Trump claims tariffs will boost the US economy and protect jobs, but economists warn that the move could harm the world economy, and push up prices for consumers in the US and around the globe. Trump's tariffs are a longtime goal fulfilled and his biggest gamble yet.</p>

The directive comes as the yuan faces heavy downward pressure following massive U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports and retaliatory moves by Beijing. Big banks were also told to step up checks when executing dollar purchase orders for their clients, one of them said, in a move markets interpret as a way for the central bank to curb speculative trades.

China has said it will "fight to the end" rather than capitulate to what it sees as US coercion, and had already raised its own trade barriers against the US. The trade in goods between the two economic powers added up to around $585bn (£429bn) last year. A large amount of batteries, which are vital for electric vehicles, were also exported.</p>
