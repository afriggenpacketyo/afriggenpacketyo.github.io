          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has engaged with world leaders and diplomats, signaling a potential shift towards military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of involvement. Modi has promised severe punishment for those responsible, and security forces from both sides have reportedly exchanged small-arms fire across the border. In Kashmir, Indian forces have initiated a clampdown, arresting hundreds in their pursuit of the perpetrators, indicating a volatile situation between the two nations. The heightened tensions raise concerns about regional stability and the potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>China is implementing more generous tax refund policies for international visitors, reducing the purchase threshold from 500 to 200 yuan and increasing the cash refund limit from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, aiming to attract more tourist revenue. This initiative is part of a broader effort to stimulate domestic spending and counter the economic impact of the trade war with the United States. The new policies, effective immediately, are expected to promote economic, trade, and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world by reducing shopping costs for overseas tourists.</p>

It discusses how vehicles have become weapons, referencing attacks by terrorist groups and individuals with varying motivations, including political, religious, and personal grievances.

          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that the Army Black Hawk helicopter crash with an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport was caused by a collapse of aviation safety redundancies, not just one error. The Black Hawk crew failed to effectively execute a common aviation practice of flying under see and avoid rules. This practice requires pilots to visually identify and avoid neighboring air traffic, often without assistance from air traffic control. The investigation highlights the need for greater scrutiny of aviation practices.</p>
