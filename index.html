          <p>A vehicle exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulting in one death and several injuries. The FBI is treating the incident as an intentional act of terrorism and has launched a major investigation, comparing it to a previous bombing in Southern California. While authorities have identified a person of interest, they are not actively searching for a suspect. The New York Times article notes that the blast area extended for blocks, causing damage to nearby buildings, and the clinic has stated that staff and reproductive materials were unharmed, expecting to resume normal operations soon. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK-EU summit is anticipated to pave the way for an agreement that could significantly reduce the impact of the Irish Sea border following Brexit. The BBC reports that the UK seeks to reset its relationship with the EU, potentially leading to a deal on trade issues, particularly in agri-food products. This could eliminate the need for checks and controls on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, although it would not entirely remove the sea border. The article also notes concerns from unionists about the current Brexit deal and the need for a closer UK-EU relationship to reduce obstacles to trade. </p>
