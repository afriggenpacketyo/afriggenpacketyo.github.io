          <p>Despite significant market downturns and international concerns, Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, staunchly defended the newly imposed tariffs on imports. They emphasized the necessity of these tariffs to address trade imbalances and ensure national security, particularly in sectors like medicine and semiconductors. Bessent claimed over 50 countries have expressed interest in negotiating trade deals, while Lutnick asserted the tariffs would remain in place for the foreseeable future. Stock markets experienced substantial losses following the tariff announcements, reflecting investor unease. Optimism score: 35</p>

          <p>Apple will continue to host TikTok on its App Store after receiving assurances from Attorney General Pam Bondi, extending the availability of the app for at least 75 more days. This decision follows President Trump's executive order to extend the TikTok ban deadline, contingent on ByteDance selling its U.S. operations under national security law. Bondi's letter to Apple stated the company would not be penalized for hosting the platform during the extension. Trump also suggested potential tariff reductions on China to facilitate a deal for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, highlighting the intertwined nature of trade and technology policy.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi expressed skepticism regarding the possibility of Donald Trump serving a third term, despite Trump's recent remarks suggesting he was considering the idea. Bondi stated that Trump would likely be finished after his current term, citing constitutional limitations. She acknowledged the significant challenge of amending the Constitution to remove the two-term limit established by the 22nd Amendment. Trump's cryptic remarks about alternative methods for securing a third term have fueled speculation, including the possibility of Vice President JD Vance running in 2028 with Trump as his running mate.
