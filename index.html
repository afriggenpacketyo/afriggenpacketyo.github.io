          <p>President Trump confirmed that the U.S. military conducted strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran, specifically targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan. The stated objective was to eliminate Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities and address the perceived threat posed by Iran. The strikes involved B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles, and the U.S. communicated that its actions were limited to these strikes, denying any intention of regime change. These actions have significantly heightened tensions in the Middle East, drawing mixed reactions from global leaders and U.S. lawmakers, with concerns raised about potential escalation and the lack of congressional authorization for military action.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have renewed calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic and its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah, stated that the attacks resulted from the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons at the expense of the Iranian people. Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, echoed the sentiment, urging for regime change and a democratic, non-nuclear republic with gender equality. These groups view the strikes as a consequence of the current regime's policies and advocate for a fundamental shift in Iranian governance.</p>

While economic issues are typically a primary focus for Latino voters, perceived threats to their community can lead to a unified ethnic voting bloc. The author points to historical examples like Proposition 187 and the 2018 midterms, where anti-immigrant sentiment mobilized Latino voters.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling the operation a "spectacular military success." The strikes, targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, aimed to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the nuclear threat. Iran has pledged to retaliate, and the U.S. has warned against any retaliation. The strikes have drawn mixed reactions from U.S. lawmakers, with some Republicans supporting the action and Democrats criticizing the lack of congressional authorization. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed no increase in off-site radiation levels following the strikes.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people. Iranian missiles impacted several sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces reported that Iran launched approximately 30 missiles. The Iranian assault occurred hours after President Trump announced U.S. military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites. Since the beginning of Israel's operation against Iran, Iran has fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel.</p>

Fifty hostages now remain in Gaza, only twenty of whom are believed to be alive. The abduction of Samerano was caught on CCTV, and the subsequent Israeli campaign against Hamas in Gaza has resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties and a humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The possibility of regime change in Iran is being speculated upon amidst ongoing conflict, but history shows that foreign-imposed regime change often leads to disastrous consequences. Examples from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya illustrate the potential for power vacuums, violence, and instability. Experts warn that a successful regime change in Iran would require a ground invasion and support from local people, which is unlikely. Aerial bombardment alone is insufficient, and a transition must be backed by local forces to avoid further conflict.</p>
