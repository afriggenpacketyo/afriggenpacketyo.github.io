          <p>The Trump administration has announced new blanket tariffs on at least seven countries, scheduled to take effect on August 1. The tariffs include a 25% rate on goods from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan, with higher rates for South Africa, Laos, and Myanmar. This move, which follows the expiration of a 90-day pause on previously announced duties, caused a downturn in U.S. financial markets. The administration's letters to the affected nations warn against retaliatory tariffs and suggest the new rates are necessary to correct trade deficits, a justification many experts critique. The policy aims to encourage manufacturing within the U.S. and renegotiate trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 14:46:46 EDT</div>

          <p>The film "F1," distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, has become Apple's most successful theatrical release, earning over $293 million at the global box office. This surpasses previous Apple films like "Napoleon" and highlights a significant achievement for the tech giant's venture into media production. The movie's success is partly attributed to a strategic partnership with IMAX, which secured a three-week exclusive run and contributed over 20% of the film's total gross. Despite its high production and marketing costs, the film's performance is a key test case for how streaming services can leverage theatrical releases to build their entertainment business and brand prestige.</p>

          <p>This article highlights two stories of remarkable generosity from viewers. In Wyoming, a man whose car was hit by a 16-year-old girl on an icy road felt compelled to help her. He launched a fundraiser and, adding his own money, raised nearly $14,000 to buy her a replacement vehicle, emphasizing that good deeds are contagious. In another story from Seattle, two young chess-playing brothers, aged seven and older, decided to donate their tournament winnings to help a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis. Their selfless act provided a much-needed spark of hope for the sick child's family during a difficult time.</p>

          <p>Raynor Winn, author of the bestselling memoir *The Salt Path*, is facing accusations that she fabricated key elements of her story. An investigation by the Observer newspaper alleges the loss of her home was due to a fraud case, not a bad investment, and questions the medical diagnosis of her husband, Moth. In response, Winn has called the claims "highly misleading" and stated that the book is the "true story of our journey," while her legal team is reviewing the matter. The controversy has led a charity to sever ties with the couple and Winn to withdraw from a scheduled tour, while the film adaptation's producers have stated they performed due diligence.</p>

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis called the government's arguments "meritless" and questioned the DOJ's transparency, noting they indicted Abrego Garcia to facilitate his return to the U.S. without informing her court. The judge found it "highly problematic" that the government was secretly planning his return for prosecution while simultaneously arguing it had no power to bring him back.

Daines clarified that this change must come from within Iran, not through U.S. intervention, to ensure its legitimacy. He believes a new regime allied with the West, rather than China or Russia, is essential to prevent future conflicts and the potential development of nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the earning potential of placing $20,000 into either a long-term or short-term certificate of deposit (CD). While current market conditions have led to higher interest rates on short-term CDs, the power of compounding interest over a longer period often results in greater total earnings from long-term CDs. For example, a 5-year CD at 4.20% could yield over $4,500 in interest, whereas a 1-year CD at a higher rate of 4.40% would earn $880. Savers must weigh the higher overall return of long-term CDs against the commitment of locking up their funds for an extended period, as early withdrawals can incur significant penalties.

          <p>El Gato Night Market, a popular destination for Latino cuisine in Los Angeles, is struggling to return to normal after shutting down for two weeks amid fears of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. The market, which typically hosts 70-80 vendors, has seen both its vendor and customer numbers drop significantly since reopening, as many in the community remain fearful. Organizers and vendors, many of whom are immigrants who rely on the market as their primary source of income, are balancing safety concerns with the necessity of work. They hope that the community, which values the market as a cultural and culinary hub, will return to support them.</p>

          <h2>Poland's Reintroduction of Border Checks Raises Concerns About the Future of Europe's Schengen Area</h2>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced temporary checks at its borders with Germany and Lithuania, a move seen by some as a sign of increasing strain on the European Union's Schengen Area of free movement. The Polish government cited the need to curb irregular migration, a justification that follows Germany's own recent tightening of border controls. This tit-for-tat measure reflects a broader European trend, with countries like France and Austria also maintaining long-term checks. Analysts warn that while these controls are often political symbolism, they risk eroding one of the EU's core achievements, potentially causing significant economic disruption and undermining European solidarity.</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times story about NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's college application has drawn sharp criticism for its questionable newsworthiness and sourcing. The article focused on Mamdani checking multiple racial identity boxes, information that reportedly came from a hacked database via a source with white supremacist ties. Media critic Margaret Sullivan argues this, combined with a pre-primary editorial urging voters not to rank Mamdani, suggests the paper is actively working against his candidacy. While the Times defended the story as helping readers understand the candidate, critics view it as an attempt to create a scandal and a breach of neutral, non-partisan news coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, questions are being raised about the adequacy of emergency warnings. An analysis shows the National Weather Service issued 22 alerts for the hard-hit Kerr County area, with the first urgent "seek higher ground" message sent at 4:03 a.m. as the river began to rise rapidly. However, no alerts were sent by local county officials, and some residents reported either not receiving warnings or not understanding their severity. The tragedy has also brought attention to concerns about staffing shortages and budget cuts at the NWS, though officials have stated the relevant offices were adequately staffed during the event.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has claimed that Israel attempted to assassinate him during the recent 12-day war. In an interview with Tucker Carlson, Pezeshkian stated that Israeli forces tried to bomb a location where he was holding a meeting in Tehran. This was his first interview since the conflict, which saw attacks from both sides and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While reaffirming Iran's willingness to negotiate with the U.S., he expressed skepticism about trust, questioning how talks could proceed if Israel might be permitted to attack them again. He also reiterated that Iran has never sought to develop a nuclear bomb.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is seeking to develop improved fuzes and secure new production sources for its 30,000-pound GBU-57/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb. This initiative follows the first combat use of the MOP during strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities last month. A contracting notice indicated interest in enhancing the bomb's tail-kit and fuzing system to increase its effectiveness against deeply buried targets. The recent use of the MOP in Iran has provided valuable data for future upgrades, which are seen as crucial for maintaining an advantage against adversaries like China and Russia, who also utilize extensive underground facilities.</p>

          <p>Alex Cooper, host of the popular "Call Her Daddy" podcast, received a mixed and partly hostile reception from Chicago Cubs fans during her guest performance of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." During the seventh-inning stretch, Cooper delivered a tongue-in-cheek, off-key rendition of the classic song, laughing throughout the performance. While some fans sang along, many others could be heard booing the bizarre and overly dramatic take on the cherished baseball tradition. The appearance was part of a special promotional event at Wrigley Field, but for many in attendance, the performance did not live up to the earnest spirit popularized by the late broadcaster Harry Caray.</p>

          <p>With a third heatwave expected to bring high temperatures to the UK, farmers are warning that the risk of devastating wildfires is dangerously high. They argue that arid conditions have turned farmlands and mountains into "tinder boxes." Some farmers claim that policies incentivizing the removal of grazing animals, like sheep, from upland areas are contributing to a dangerous buildup of dry vegetation, which acts as fuel for fires. The National Farmers' Union has called for government and fire services to work with them on prevention and to review land management practices, as hotter, drier summers become more common.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics has found a significant increase in handgun possession among teenagers in Florida over the past two decades. From 2002 to 2022, general handgun carrying among adolescents rose by 65%, with the most substantial increases seen among females, middle school students, and white teens. The research, which analyzed survey data from over 700,000 students, highlights a troubling trend despite rising concerns about gun violence among youth. In contrast, the study found that carrying handguns in school actually decreased by 60% during the same period, suggesting school safety measures may be having a localized effect.</p>
