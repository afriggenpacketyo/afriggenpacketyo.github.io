          <h2>U.S. Transportation Safety Board Calls for Caution Regarding Speculation on Air India Crash Cause</h2>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has cautioned that media reports speculating on the cause of a recent Air India crash that killed 270 people are premature. Following a preliminary report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) that mentioned the engine fuel cutoff switches, media outlets began suggesting pilot error or even suicidal intent. The NTSB, along with Indian officials and pilot federations, has urged the public and press to await the final investigation results, condemning the speculative reporting as irresponsible. The incident involves a Boeing Dreamliner, and the investigation is ongoing to determine the precise sequence of events leading to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A fireworks display at the Düsseldorf Rheinkirmes fair resulted in 19 injuries, four of them serious, after rockets reportedly exploded too close to the crowd. In other German news, the government is facing scrutiny over its latest deportation flights to Afghanistan, with reports questioning the 'dangerous criminal' label applied to some deportees. Additionally, the German Red Cross has issued a warning that the population lacks sufficient skills in first aid and self-reliance for major emergencies, criticizing current government funding for preparedness training as inadequate. These events highlight ongoing safety, immigration, and civil defense concerns within the country.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has officially announced its support for London's bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships. This backing, which includes significant funding, provides a major boost for the proposal to bring the event back to London Stadium for the first time since 2017. The decision follows an open letter from over 100 British athletes urging support and addresses previous concerns about the necessary government investment. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that hosting the championships would be a moment of national pride and would inspire the next generation of athletes.</p>

          <p>Edwin J. Feulner, the influential co-founder and long-serving president of the Heritage Foundation, has passed away at the age of 83. He is credited with transforming the conservative think tank from a small organization into a major policy force in Washington, D.C., particularly shaping Reagan-era reforms. Feulner remained active in recent years, notably contributing to Project 2025, a policy initiative for a potential second Trump administration. The Heritage Foundation praised him as a visionary and patriot who championed a 'big-tent conservatism' and left a lasting legacy on the American conservative movement.</p>

          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former President Yoon Suk Yeol on charges of abuse of power related to his controversial declaration of martial law in December 2024. The indictment follows an investigation into what has been described as an attempt to subvert civilian rule by deploying troops to parliament. Yoon, who was detained in January and again last week over concerns of evidence tampering, is also accused of not following proper procedures for the declaration and falsifying documents. This marks a significant development in the ongoing legal and political turmoil surrounding the former president's actions while in office.</p>

Despite their differing standings, LAFC's coach Steve Cherundolo emphasizes that form is irrelevant in such a heated rivalry.

          <p>In an effort to demonstrate its safety and allay public fears, the Japanese government has delivered decontaminated soil from the Fukushima region to be used at the Prime Minister's office in Tokyo. The slightly radioactive soil, collected after the 2011 nuclear disaster, will be used as foundation material in a garden, following safety guidelines endorsed by the IAEA. This is part of a larger government initiative to recycle the 14 million cubic meters of soil stored near the Fukushima plant.

The warning, covering parts of southern and eastern England, anticipates that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours on Saturday. This intense rainfall follows a recent heatwave, meaning the dry, parched ground will be less able to absorb the water, increasing the risk of fast-flowing, deep floodwaters.

The law requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets, a move proponents say will buttress the dollar's global status. However, critics argue the bill lacks sufficient anti-money laundering protections and could make the U.S. financial system vulnerable to illicit use. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Chemotherapy Can Awaken Dormant Cancer Cells, Potentially Accelerating Metastasis</h2>

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy can inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings, particularly relevant for breast cancer patients, help explain why metastasis can occur even after a primary tumor is successfully treated. This research provides direct evidence of this 'dormancy awakening' mechanism. The team also discovered that combining specific drugs with chemotherapy could inhibit this process in mice, and a clinical trial to test this strategy in breast cancer patients is now underway.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has indicated it does not expect to provide compensation to thousands of Afghans whose personal details were leaked in a major data breach in 2022. The MoD stated it would 'robustly defend' against legal action, citing an independent review that concluded it was 'highly unlikely' individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked spreadsheet. The data of over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation was compromised, with many now fearing for their safety under Taliban rule. A law firm is preparing a lawsuit on behalf of over 1,000 Afghan clients affected by the breach.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages against the Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and its parent companies. The suit stems from a report detailing a sexually suggestive letter allegedly sent by Trump to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, while the newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones, has expressed full confidence in its reporting and stated it will vigorously defend against the lawsuit. The legal action unfolds as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information related to the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced it is eliminating its primary scientific division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The move is part of a broader agency reorganization and is expected to impact hundreds of scientists and result in $748.8 million in savings. The ORD conducts critical research on environmental pollutants to safeguard public health, and its closure is part of a 22% staff reduction at the EPA under the Trump administration. Former agency officials and current employees have expressed alarm, warning that dismantling the internationally respected research body is dangerous.</p>

          <p>China's central disciplinary authorities are publicly shaming a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prominent example of grass-roots government mismanagement and wasteful spending. The 'Yaohan Longevity City' project, which was intended to be a major health tourism hub, was left largely abandoned after poor decisions and a broken capital chain. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) condemned the local officials for making 'blind decisions' that led to a severe waste of resources. This public censure serves as a stern warning to other local-level governments across China to avoid similar ill-conceived vanity projects.</p>

          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in China have proposed a new 'super X-rail gun' design that aims to be significantly more powerful than the current naval version. The existing naval railgun, first seen on a ship in 2018, is limited by the immense power required, which restricts projectile weight and firing power. The army's proposed solution involves a cross-stacked design with two rail guns in one, which could nearly double the force and allow for heavier projectiles. This development seeks to overcome existing technological hurdles and advance the military application of electromagnetic weapon systems for greater battlefield effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Serious water pollution incidents caused by water companies in England surged by 60% in a single year, according to new data from the Environment Agency. There were a record 2,801 total pollution incidents in 2024, with 75 classified as causing serious harm to the environment and human health. A cross-party parliamentary committee has labeled the situation 'woeful' and criticized regulators as 'missing in action.' The figures highlight years of underinvestment and weak regulation, with companies like Thames Water being the worst offenders, prompting calls for systemic reform and greater accountability.</p>

Approximately two-thirds of the public favor these space exploration goals, with younger Americans showing particularly strong enthusiasm. The poll also found that a large majority still believe the original 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile endeavor. These findings suggest broad public backing for the nation's space program, which many feel contributes to national pride and produces beneficial technological advancements for society.</p>
