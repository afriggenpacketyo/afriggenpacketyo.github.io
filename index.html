          <p>President Trump announced that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer being considered for Federal Reserve chair, narrowing the list of potential candidates to four. The news comes after the resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, which provides Trump an opportunity to appoint another official to the board. Likely contenders include Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, both of whom have advocated for lower interest rates amid White House pressure on the central bank to implement cuts.

These allegations bring renewed attention to the concept of "de-banking," where conservatives and others claim they are unfairly denied financial services for political reasons.

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has publicly requested donations of unwanted small pets and horses to be used as food for its predator animals. The zoo defended the practice as a way to mimic the natural food chain and provide "whole prey" for its carnivores, ensuring their welfare and natural behavior. The policy, which includes gentle euthanasia by trained staff, has generated public backlash, echoing a previous controversy at another Danish zoo in 2014 involving a giraffe.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. By leaving, the Democrats denied the state House the quorum needed to conduct business, stalling a bill that would create five new GOP-leaning districts. The dramatic move has escalated a partisan showdown over gerrymandering, with President Trump weighing in to claim Republicans are "entitled" to the additional seats.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is reportedly directing prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury investigating the origins of the FBI's 2016 Trump-Russia probe. The move follows years of pressure from Donald Trump and his allies, who have long alleged that the investigation into Russian election interference was a politically motivated effort to undermine his campaign. This development revisits a deeply divisive chapter in American politics and is likely to heighten concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

Analysts warn that the crisis is a consequence of poor governance and systemic neglect, which has crippled the region's agricultural production and stability.</p>
