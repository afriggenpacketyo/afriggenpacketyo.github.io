          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and California Governor Gavin Newsom are engaged in a heated exchange regarding the handling of protests in Los Angeles. Johnson criticized Newsom's governance, suggesting he should be "tarred and feathered" for obstructing federal law enforcement, while Newsom responded sarcastically, referencing 1700s-style punishments. Johnson defended President Trump's deployment of Marines and National Guardsmen to LA as within his authority to maintain order. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump's actions, contrasting them with his refusal to send in the guard during the January 6th insurrection, highlighting a perceived double standard. The situation underscores the escalating tensions between state and federal authorities amidst ongoing unrest.</p>

          <p>David Marcus argues that the Trump administration's swift deployment of the National Guard and the promise of Marine support in Los Angeles have effectively quelled potential riots. This action encouraged a stronger local response and deterred ordinary citizens from joining the protests. Marcus contrasts this with the summer of 2020, when the previous administration did not mobilize the National Guard against the wishes of Democratic governors, resulting in widespread destruction. By stiffening the resolve of local law enforcement and discouraging large crowds, the Trump administration has transformed potentially deadly riots into manageable criminal acts, showing a lesson learned from past experiences.</p>

Christianity remains the largest religion, with 2.3 billion adherents, but its growth rate has declined. The religiously unaffiliated are now the third-largest group, particularly in Europe and North America, where many raised Christian no longer identify with any religion, marking the first time Pew has tracked religious switching patterns across 117 countries.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is facing a potential financial crisis due to a bruising price war led by market leader BYD. This intense competition is depressing profits for both EV manufacturers and used car sellers, leading to concerns about financial stress within the industry. Government-backed industry groups have cautioned against "dumping" vehicles below production costs, drawing parallels to the crisis in China's property sector. Executives are sounding the alarm, with one comparing the situation to an "Evergrande-like" crisis, raising fears of unsustainable competition and potential income declines for workers.

The Reichstag fire provided Hitler with the excuse he needed to suspend civil liberties and suppress political opposition, enabling him to seize authoritarian power. The article highlights the concerns of Heinrich Held, the minister president of Bavaria, who recognized the "seeds of dictatorship" in the emergency-powers provision of Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse shares experienced a decline following the announcement of CFO Chris Monroe's departure, though the company suggests it was not due to any misconduct. Jim Cramer views the stock's reaction as a buying opportunity for those not already invested. He points to factors like tame interest rates and rising oil prices as potential economic indicators, suggesting the economy may not be as negatively impacted by trade talks as initially feared. Cramer also notes positive signs for the chip industry, citing TSMC's strong sales data as beneficial for Nvidia and other related companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to eliminate all USAID (United States Agency for International Development) overseas positions worldwide by September 30, restructuring foreign aid operations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered the abolishment of the agency's entire international workforce, transferring control of foreign assistance programs directly to the State Department. This decision follows previous cuts to USAID's programs and personnel, with remaining officials ordered to destroy classified documents. Amid the cuts, Elon Musk boasted of feeding USAID “into the woodchopper,” while disseminating false claims about its programs, according to reports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides six actionable steps to take when dealing with maxed-out credit cards, emphasizing the importance of immediate action. The first step is to stop using the cards for nonessential spending and switch to cash or debit. Reviewing minimum payments and due dates is crucial to avoid late fees, and exploring balance transfer options or debt consolidation loans can help lower interest rates. Enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency and creating a crisis budget are also recommended to regain financial control. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy Jr.'s decision to fire all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is drawing criticism from health policy experts. They argue that this move undermines science, disrupts a trusted regulatory process, and could increase public distrust in vaccinations. Experts warn that Kennedy might appoint members sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views, leading to politicized recommendations and deterring Americans from getting vaccinated. This action follows Kennedy's earlier decision to drop the CDC's recommendation for routine Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, further fueling concerns within the medical community.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that emperor penguin populations in Antarctica may be declining faster than the most pessimistic predictions. Analysis of satellite images from 2009 to 2024 indicates a 22% decline in the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea, and Bellingshausen Sea, where a third of the global population resides. The study attributes the decline to climate change, which is thinning and destabilizing the ice under the penguins' feet in their breeding grounds. Researchers suggest that the models projecting the species' future may need to be reevaluated with this new, concerning data.</p>

Despite government assurances, critics have raised concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact, with EDF also building a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, which is expected to switch on in the early 2030s, which will be over a decade late and having cost billions more than originally planned.</p>
