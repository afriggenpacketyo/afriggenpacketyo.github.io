          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine, suggesting a meeting in Istanbul on May 15 to achieve a durable peace and address the root causes of the war, although he did not specify who would participate in the talks. This proposal follows a demand from European leaders for Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, which Putin did not directly address. Putin has previously linked ceasefires to conditions such as halting NATO expansion and removing Ukraine's President Zelenskyy. This is not the first time Putin has made a request like this, as direct talks were also attempted in March of 2022.</p>

          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016, marking a turning point in his struggle with addiction. Dyer, known for his role in 'EastEnders,' shared that he had been making 'a lot of bad decisions' due to the effects of fame and drug use. The letter from Dani made him reflect on the pain he had caused his family and commit to continuing his treatment at the facility in South Africa. Dyer's decision to seek help came after realizing how his addiction was affecting those around him, including his wife and children.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March. A federal judge ordered her release, citing concerns that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, as the Trump administration allegedly detained her over an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received and emphasized the importance of remembering other women in immigration detention centers. Her lawyers argued that her asthma worsened during her six weeks in detention, and leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her release as a victory for justice and democracy.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump claimed a 'total reset' in US-China trade relations following the first day of talks between American and Chinese officials in Geneva, aimed at de-escalating a trade war triggered by his tariff policies. Trump praised the discussions as 'very good' and said they were negotiated in a 'friendly, but constructive, manner,' though he did not provide specific details. The talks occurred after weeks of escalating tensions, with the US imposing tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods and China retaliating with levies of 125% on US goods, leading to a near trade embargo between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Four people, including three teenagers, were shot on a SEPTA bus in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park neighborhood, prompting a police investigation. The incident occurred on Girard Avenue, leaving two 16-year-old boys, a 14-year-old boy, and a 39-year-old woman injured, but in stable condition. Authorities believe the shooter, described as a man in his 40s, confronted a group of juveniles before opening fire, and cameras on board captured the entire incident.

Years later, Opanowski testified against Doyle, detailing the abuse she endured and helping prosecutors establish a pattern of violence. Doyle was found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to 25 years to life, while Opanowski found closure and became an advocate for domestic violence awareness.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has revealed that a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise as a safe and effective therapy for a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option when treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The oral medication works by targeting the HER2 protein and blocking the activity of the protein’s tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signaling cell growth. The trial was conducted at 82 sites around the world, including locations in the US, China, and Japan.</p>

This project, modeled after New York City's High Line, aims to create a new tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, and cafes. The KK Line was closed in April as part of a broader project to redirect portions of the Shuto Expressway.</p>

This loss also highlighted a concerning trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records since their strong start to the season.

The case hinged on text messages revealing Ryan's administration of drugs to Harris and the power imbalance in their relationship.

          <h2>Japan's Reluctance to Embrace App-Based Salary Payments</h2>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual shift towards a cashless society, app-based digital salary payments have struggled to gain traction two years after their introduction. While over 100 companies offer mobile payment apps like PayPay as a salary payment method, only a small percentage of workers use this option. Experts suggest that the lack of perceived benefits and the limited availability of this option to full-time employees contribute to the low adoption rate. However, the percentage of cashless payments in Japan has topped 40%, indicating a slow but steady move away from cash.</p>

This event is atypical because atmospheric rivers usually originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., however this one is being routed east due to a 'cutoff low' pressure system.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the US-Canada border are feeling the economic strain of Trump's trade war, with a significant drop in Canadians crossing the border. Border crossings have decreased by 17% since Trump began imposing tariffs, leading to reduced business for restaurants and duty-free shops. The Covid-19 pandemic had already damaged economies in the area, and the new trade war is causing further hardship. Many Canadians are choosing to 'Buy Canadian' and reduce travel to the US in response to the strained relationship between the two countries.</p>
