        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, a conscious parenting expert, suggests alternative phrases to traditional parenting that foster cooperation rather than defiance in children. Instead of using commands or threats, she recommends explaining decisions respectfully and acknowledging children's feelings. Raouda emphasizes creating an environment where children feel respected, emotionally safe, and involved, which reduces power struggles and promotes emotional resilience. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can build stronger, more trusting relationships with their children, ultimately raising emotionally resilient adults.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people, after the U.S. joined Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, causing significant damage to buildings and prompting searches for people trapped under rubble. The Iranian assault occurred hours after President Trump announced that the U.S. military had carried out strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites. Since the beginning of Israel's operation against Iran, Iran has fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, resulting in numerous casualties.</p>

Recent incidents include attacks on Democratic legislators in Minnesota, violence during "No Kings" demonstrations, and threats against lawmakers. Experts attribute this trend to a period of high social change and increasing polarization, with rising support for the use of force to achieve political goals. While violence has been committed by individuals across the political spectrum, some argue that Republican leaders bear greater responsibility for the current climate.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Florida are facing accusations of racially gerrymandering two state senate districts to disenfranchise Black voters in the Tampa Bay area. The ACLU argues that the redistricting process, which involved connecting disparate areas across Tampa Bay, was designed to dilute Black voting power. Critics argue that the maps pack Black voters into a single district, undermining their representation in other districts. A court will rule on whether the redistricting process was unconstitutional, potentially requiring a redrawing of the districts.</p>

That includes, he said, a rise of for-profit dialysis clinics and their impact on quality of care for those confronting end-stage kidney disease.</p>

          <p>The world's reaction to U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities has been varied, with international officials largely expressing alarm and calling for restraint. Middle Eastern governments, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Qatar, warned of regional destabilization, while Iran's allies condemned the strikes. In Israel, the strikes were hailed as a move to eliminate an existential threat, while European leaders urged restraint and a return to diplomacy. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres condemned the use of force, and Russia strongly condemned the U.S. bombings.</p>

          <p>Maddie Machado, a recruiter, advises job seekers to create a "brag doc" to document their career wins and showcase their impact to potential employers. This method involves categorizing specific aspects of professional success and highlighting accomplishments that demonstrate value to a new company. Machado argues that a brag doc can be more effective than a traditional resume or cover letter, as it allows candidates to showcase their achievements and prepare for interviews. She suggests using the brag doc to network, follow up with hiring managers, and negotiate a strong job offer.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling them a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The president warned Iran to strive for a peace deal in its war with Israel, or face "far greater" attacks. Defense Department officials confirmed that American B-2 Spirit bombers were used in the strikes, and that the U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically to say the strikes are all the U.S. plans and that regime change efforts are not planned.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Trump's attacks on Black cultural institutions are driven by a fear of Black culture's power to challenge white supremacy, rather than a mere rejection of diversity. The author draws parallels to the Black Arts Movement (BAM) and its success in building independent Black institutions that promoted Black consciousness. Trump's efforts to defund and control cultural institutions are seen as an attempt to dismantle the infrastructure that supports Black cultural expression and its potential for political action. The author criticizes the focus on diversity and inclusion as insufficient, arguing that it reinforces the belief that Black culture only holds value within white-dominated spaces.</p>
