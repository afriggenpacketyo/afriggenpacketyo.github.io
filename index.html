            <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, was convicted on all 15 counts related to a bribery scheme. The charges stem from accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including gold bars and cash, in exchange for political favors benefiting the Egyptian government. Her husband had already been convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison, and resigned from his Senate seat. The acting U.S. Attorney emphasized that the verdict sends a clear message against corruption, while Menendez's attorney expressed devastation and vowed to continue fighting the case.</p>

            <p>Microsoft shares experienced a decline due to the commencement of a high-profile antitrust case against Alphabet, a peer company, and a price target reduction from Barclays. The Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet focuses on AI-related concerns, prompting speculation that Microsoft could also face similar antitrust scrutiny given its investment in OpenAI. Barclays lowered its price target for Microsoft from $475 to $430 per share, although maintaining an overweight recommendation. The market reacted negatively to the news, reflecting broader concerns about the regulatory environment for big tech.</p>

            <p>The United Nations is warning about the global expansion of multi-billion-dollar cyberscam operations originating in Asia. Crime syndicates are targeting victims through investment, cryptocurrency, and romance scams, often using trafficked workers forced to conduct the online cons. While initially concentrated in Southeast Asia, these networks are now expanding to South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Pacific islands. The UN is urging international action to address this growing threat and prevent further exploitation.</p>

Google asserts that it is at the forefront of American companies making technological breakthroughs and that the breakup would put the U.S. at a disadvantage in the global race for technology leadership.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case that challenges the Affordable Care Act's provision for free preventive healthcare services. At issue is the constitutionality of the US Preventive Services Task Force, which determines which preventive services insurers must cover without cost to patients. The court is considering whether the law adequately supervises the taskforce or if the taskforce operates as an independent governmental body. A ruling against the ACA could mean many Americans would no longer receive life-saving tests and treatments cost-free.</p>
