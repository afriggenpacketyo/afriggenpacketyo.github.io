          <p>Marks & Spencer has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July due to a recent cyber-attack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The ransomware attack, suspected to be the work of Scattered Spider using tools from DragonForce, initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments. M&S estimates the cyber-attack will reduce profits for the current year by around £300 million, a significant hit to their earnings. Despite the disruption, CEO Stuart Machin asserts the company's turnaround strategy remains unchanged, viewing the incident as an opportunity to accelerate the pace of change.</p>

          <p>German authorities have launched multiple raids across three states and arrested five suspected far-right extremists. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is set to address lawmakers regarding tougher border checks implemented earlier this month, which allow officials to turn back migrants even if they apply for asylum. The German Council of Economic Experts will release its economic forecasts amidst concerns about Germany's struggle to emerge from stagnation after two years in recession. The new government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to implement reforms, including slashing corporate taxes and cutting red tape, to revitalize the economy.</p>

          <p>The cast of the US comedy series Cheers has paid tribute to George Wendt, who played Norm Peterson, after his death at the age of 76. Wendt starred as Norm in all 275 episodes of Cheers and earned six consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series. Ted Danson, who played bar boss Sam Malone, said he was devastated, while Kelsey Grammer, who played Frasier Crane, said he liked George a lot and that he was beloved by millions. Wendt also appeared in several movies and had been married to fellow actor Bernadette Birkett since 1978, with whom he had three children.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Angela Rayner advocated for tax rises, differing from Chancellor Reeves' approach, ahead of departmental spending plans. The memo proposed measures such as increasing the corporation tax rate on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While government insiders downplayed the significance of the memo, Conservatives seized on it as evidence of Labour's intent to raise taxes. The memo highlights internal disagreements within the Labour party regarding fiscal policy, particularly concerning wealth taxes and borrowing.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed an immunity to multiple types of venom. Researchers are studying Friede's blood in hopes of synthesizing a universal antivenom that could be used for various snake bites. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snakes bite between one and three million people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Existing antivenoms are typically derived from animals injected with small amounts of specific venoms to produce neutralizing antibodies.</p>

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, is anticipated to confront the rise of Trumpian nationalism, potentially creating conflict with Maga Catholics. His predecessor, Pope Francis, championed progressive causes, leading some on the Maga right to caricature Leo as a continuity pontiff. The new pope's choice of name signals his recognition of the challenge posed by right-wing populism, mirroring Leo XIII's mission to address economic inequalities and the dangers of state idolatry. Leo XIV aims to address issues like wars, climate change, inequality, and migration, contrasting with the Maga worldview.</p>

The New York Times notes the shift in dynamic, with candidates acknowledging their interest rather than pretending otherwise.

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike emphasized the need to protect residents' lives and daily living due to declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer.

The comment was viewed as insensitive and out of touch with the public's economic struggles. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. The resignation comes ahead of a parliamentary election and adds pressure on Ishiba's already unpopular government.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Calls US Export Curbs on AI Chips to China a Failure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that US export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China have been ineffective, as companies are turning to locally-developed technology. He noted that US curbs have forced Chinese companies to buy semiconductors from domestic designers like Huawei. This has also spurred China to aggressively invest in developing an independent supply chain. Huang added that Nvidia's market share in China's AI chip market has significantly decreased due to these export controls. The US government recently rolled back some curbs following complaints about hindering AI development.</p>

          <p>During a Senate hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus as the president's right to remove people from the country. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, explaining that habeas corpus is a constitutional right protecting individuals from unlawful detention. The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus for detained migrants, but legal experts say only Congress can suspend it. Noem's response reflected the administration's expansive view of presidential power and sparked controversy.</p>

The decision follows criticism from Downing Street, which deemed it unacceptable for bosses at the troubled firm to reward themselves for failure. The company's "retention scheme" could have amounted to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, potentially leading to them getting £1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses.
