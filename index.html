          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed that Israel has agreed to a ceasefire with Iran, following escalating strikes and counter-strikes between the two nations. The announcement came after President Trump initially declared the ceasefire effective, though reports emerged of continued missile attacks from Iran just before the truce was set to begin. Despite the agreement, the Israeli Defense Forces accused Iran of violating the ceasefire terms. This development follows a period of heightened tensions and military actions, including U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and Iranian missile attacks on U.S. military bases. </p>

          <p>The German government has approved a draft budget for 2025, which includes a significant increase in government spending, facilitated by easing the country's debt brake. The budget allocates funds to repair aging infrastructure, support economic stimulus, and substantially increase military investment, with the defense budget expected to more than double by 2029. Net borrowing is set to rise sharply, reaching €81.8 billion in 2025. The budget was delayed due to national elections and is now heading to the Bundestag for debate before a final vote in September.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only have a minor role in the future financial system, citing a lack of key characteristics found in traditional currencies. The BIS suggests that stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currencies or reserve assets, are susceptible to illicit use due to their pseudonymity and lack of issuer oversight. Instead, the BIS proposes a unified platform for tokenized central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds as a more viable foundation for the next-generation monetary and financial system. This perspective comes amid increasing interest in stablecoins from major economies. </p>

A Harvard scientist, Dr. David Corey, is working on gene therapies but expresses concern that terminated and pending grants will slow down progress.

Morgan, who completed a finance and accounting degree with a year in industry, faced numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, leading her to question the value of her degree. She believes the use of AI in resume screening programs initially hindered her progress, as her CV was not ATS-compatible.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. military strikes in Iran, concerns are rising about the potential impact on global oil supplies and energy prices. While initial market reactions saw a surge in crude prices, followed by a decline, experts speculate that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. Disruptions to the Strait could severely impact oil markets, particularly in China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Analysts suggest that a prolonged conflict or Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities could further destabilize the energy market, potentially driving prices higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish authorities are investigating the discovery of multiple bodies in the Mediterranean Sea, near Spain, with their hands and feet bound. At least five bodies have been spotted since mid-May, leading police to suspect the victims may be migrants from North Africa. Investigators believe the migrants may have been tied up and thrown into the sea, possibly due to a dispute with smugglers. The discovery highlights the dangerous and cruel realities of irregular migration routes, with authorities working to identify the victims and determine the causes of death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The decline of deep reading, or sustained engagement with longform texts, is raising concerns about its potential impact on politics and society. As neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf explains, deep reading activates various cognitive capacities, fostering connections and original thoughts. Some analysts argue that the shift away from books towards digital media is reversing literacy's effects, leading to less abstract, rational, and universalistic thinking. This shift is said to promote tribalism and conformity, potentially undermining liberal democracy. However, some argue that this claim is an overestimation, as literacy does not reliably induce a commitment to liberal values.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies is still struggling to advance to the 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process, which is shown by the analysis of its newest laptop hardware, due to the impact of U.S. sanctions. The MateBook Fold Ultimate Design laptop uses Huawei's Kirin X90 SoC, manufactured by SMIC using a 7-nm process. This finding suggests that Huawei is still behind its U.S. competitors, like Apple, that are already using TSMC’s 3-nm process. This report dampens any speculation that Huawei has made the leap to SMIC’s 5-nm process, which is difficult to scale because of U.S. sanctions on the sale of the most advanced chipmaking equipment to Chinese fabrication plants.</p>
