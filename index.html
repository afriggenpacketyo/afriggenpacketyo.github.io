          <p>Buyers spent more than $140 million to acquire $TRUMP meme coins in an effort to secure an invitation to an "intimate dinner" with President Trump, according to Inca Digital. The announcement that the top 220 holders would be invited to the dinner boosted the coin's value. Some top holders spent anywhere from $53,500 to $16.4 million to secure an invite. The dinner contest has raised concerns about purchases of a Trump-branded asset being linked to access to the president, with critics adding that Trump and his family stand to benefit financially from purchases of the memecoin.</p>

          <p>Zhejiang, one of China's richest provinces and a major exporter to the U.S., has been significantly impacted by the trade war between China and the United States. The province suffered acutely from high levies imposed by the U.S. on Chinese goods, leading to widespread angst and an "extreme stress test" on its economy. Zhejiang sought to "Trump-proof" itself by guarding against the worst fallout, but the damage has been extensive. Analysts suggest the recent de-escalation offers a chance for businesses to adapt and pivot away from reliance on the U.S. market.</p>
