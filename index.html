          <p>A U.S. State Department employee, Michael Schena, has been sentenced to four years in prison for conspiring to transmit national defense secrets. He sold sensitive government documents for at least $10,000 to individuals he believed were agents of the Chinese government. Although prosecutors could not definitively prove the information reached Chinese agents, the case was built on Schena's admission of his belief about who he was dealing with. Schena abused his top-secret security clearance, betraying the trust placed in him by the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order to begin renaming the Department of Defense to its pre-1940s name, the Department of War. The order will initially allow the use of "Department of War" as a secondary title, with a path toward making the change permanent through legislative action. The White House argues the name change conveys a stronger message of military readiness and resolve, moving away from what the president considers a "too defensive" and "politically correct" moniker. The department was originally renamed after World War II to remove references to war and reorganize the military bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation has withdrawn a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to offer cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays and cancellations. The Biden-era proposal would have required payments up to $775 for disruptions within an airline's control. The current administration stated it will reconsider "extra-statutory requirements" that go beyond what Congress has mandated, while still committing to enforcing ticket refunds for canceled flights. Airline industry groups, which had opposed the rule, praised the decision, arguing the regulation was overly burdensome and would increase ticket prices.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa has expressed frustration over the impact of financial regulations on the club's summer transfer window, stating the restrictions "killed" their ability to sign players. The club had to navigate UEFA's financial rules and the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR), resulting in a net surplus in spending. After selling a key player, Villa only managed to add players on loan and a free agent on deadline day. Konsa remains hopeful that the new additions can help improve the team's poor start to the season.</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Bella Culley, a 19-year-old pregnant British woman imprisoned in Georgia for alleged drug smuggling, has criticized the British embassy for its lack of support. He claims the embassy has not visited since he was appointed and has failed to provide written references or check on her health. Culley was arrested in May with a large quantity of marijuana and hashish, pleading not guilty and claiming she was coerced through torture. The UK Foreign Office stated it is supporting her and is in contact with her family and local authorities.</p>

          <p>Joseph McNeil, one of the four Black college students who initiated the landmark 1960 Greensboro lunch counter sit-in, has passed away at the age of 83. Their nonviolent protest at a segregated Woolworth's counter sparked a wave of similar demonstrations across the American South, becoming a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. The protest helped lead to the desegregation of the Greensboro counter within six months and contributed to the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. McNeil later served in the Air Force, retiring as a two-star major general, and is remembered for his courage and conviction.</p>

The Hennepin County Attorney's Office supported his release, acknowledging the conviction was tainted by false evidence. Hooper's case highlights a significant miscarriage of justice, and he has now been reunited with his family. The woman who confessed is currently imprisoned in Georgia for a separate crime.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that faulty diagnostic machines used by 16 hospital trusts in England have produced inaccurate diabetes test results, requiring at least 55,000 people to be re-tested.

NHS England is recalling affected patients, stating the risk is low for those misdiagnosed, as they would have first received lifestyle advice.

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the DOJ will act if Boston won't protect its citizens from "illegal alien crime." The suit specifically targets the Boston Trust Act, which limits the city's role in enforcing federal immigration laws, a policy Mayor Wu has vowed to defend.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump is carving out a focused and influential role in her husband's second term, concentrating on issues at the intersection of technology and children's welfare. Building on her "Be Best" initiative, she has been instrumental in the passage of the Take It Down Act, which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Her recent White House event on AI in education, attended by tech industry leaders, further signals her focus on using her platform to address emerging technological challenges. Historians note her approach is less about traditional maternal advocacy and more focused on the business and legislative aspects of protecting children.</p>

          <p>With home equity levels at record highs and an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, homeowners may be considering a home equity loan. The article advises asking several key questions before proceeding, such as accurately determining how much equity is available to borrow and whether the financial need is urgent enough to justify current interest rates. Homeowners should also weigh the benefits of borrowing now against the possibility of securing lower rates in the future. The decision requires careful consideration of personal financial needs and the potential for future market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The surge in popularity of stablecoins, digital assets pegged to fiat currencies, presents a complex dilemma for Beijing. Over 99% of these stablecoins are backed by the U.S. dollar, which significantly amplifies the greenback's dominance in the digital currency space, far exceeding its share of traditional global payments and reserves. This trend could challenge China's efforts to promote the yuan and reduce reliance on the dollar. The article explores why these U.S. dollar-backed tokens are gaining traction and considers the potential strategic responses from Beijing as it navigates the rapidly evolving world of digital finance.

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated a legal battle over presidential power by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the temporary removal of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This request follows lower court rulings that blocked Trump's attempt to fire her, citing statutory tenure protections designed to ensure the independence of regulatory agencies. The Justice Department argues that the modern FTC wields substantial executive power, meaning its commissioners should serve at the president's will. The case could have significant implications for the independence of federal agencies from direct presidential control.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into allegations that Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard received millions in undisclosed payments from a startup linked to team owner Steve Ballmer. Bankruptcy documents reportedly show that Aspiration Partners, a company partially funded by Ballmer, had a $28 million endorsement deal with Leonard for which he allegedly did no work, raising suspicions it was a way to bypass the league's salary cap. The Clippers have denied any wrongdoing, but if proven, such a violation could result in severe penalties, including fines, loss of draft picks, and the voiding of Leonard's contract.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland defeated Luxembourg 3-1 in a World Cup qualifying match, earning praise from manager Michael O'Neill for their second-half performance. After an early lead was cancelled out by a Luxembourg equalizer, O'Neill said he delivered some "tough words" at half-time. The team responded immediately, with Shea Charles scoring just 25 seconds into the second half to restore the lead. A red card for a Luxembourg player helped solidify Northern Ireland's control, and a third goal secured the crucial victory, which O'Neill described as the reaction he wanted from his team.</p>

          <p>A strong, rotten-egg-like smell has been plaguing the city of Gloucester, Massachusetts, with the source identified as a large amount of decaying invasive seaweed. The seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica, was pushed onto the shore and into a local estuary by the high winds and rough surf from the recent Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes without being washed back out to sea, it releases a powerful odor that residents have compared to raw sewage. City officials have assured the public that while unpleasant, the smell is part of a natural process resulting from the storm's impact.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with significant funds, such as $10,000, should act strategically to lock in high returns on Certificates of Deposit (CDs). The article suggests savers should consider depositing more money if possible to maximize earnings before rates fall. It also recommends shopping directly with online banks, which typically offer higher rates, and acting quickly, as banks may lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision. Making a well-informed move now can help savers secure better returns before the current high-rate opportunity diminishes. (not investment advice)</p>

His time in charge was marked by significant business success, including the development of a new billion-pound stadium and consistent European qualification, but was also defined by a lack of major trophies and frequent fan protests. Sources suggest the club's ownership decided a change was needed to achieve greater sporting success. Levy's departure comes after a recent Europa League win, and he will be replaced by a new leadership structure, with Peter Charrington becoming non-executive chairman.</p>

The facility, built by the DeSantis administration to support President Trump's deportation efforts, can now continue to operate while the state's appeal is heard. A district judge had previously ordered the center closed within 60 days, citing environmental concerns and harsh conditions for detainees. The appellate panel's 2-1 decision stated that halting the closure was in the public interest and that the project likely did not require the federal environmental reviews that were at the heart of the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A recent Senate hearing revealed a more combative version of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., alarming senators from both parties who had previously received his assurances on vaccine access. In his testimony, he aggressively defended anti-vaccine talking points, supported claims that mRNA vaccines cause "serious harm," and clashed with lawmakers over his administration's policies. The article suggests that some Republican senators now feel Kennedy was dishonest during his confirmation process. This defiant performance, seemingly enabled by President Trump, signals a continued, bold assault on the U.S. public health and vaccination system from within the government.</p>
