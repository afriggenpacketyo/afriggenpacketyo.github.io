          <p>Donald Trump stated in an interview that he has organized a consortium of "very wealthy people" prepared to acquire TikTok, with their identities to be revealed within two weeks. This development occurs as the platform faces a potential U.S. ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divests its American operations due to national security concerns. The deadline for this divestiture has been extended to September 17, with Trump expressing a desire to see the popular app continue under new, American-friendly ownership.</p>

The legislation, which narrowly passed the House, includes increased funding for border security and defense offset by cuts to social programs, and is projected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to bypass Democratic opposition, but face internal dissent that could jeopardize its passage before the July 4th deadline.

          <p>During a visit to Tel Aviv, German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt voiced strong support for Israel's recent attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. He characterized Iran's nuclear ambitions as a significant threat not only to Israel's existence but also to European security, stating that Iran has been a destabilizing force in the region for decades. Dobrindt's comments underscore Germany's close alliance with Israel and its firm stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons, which Tehran claims are for civilian purposes.</p>

          <p>At its party congress, Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) passed a motion to begin preparations for banning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The move follows the domestic intelligence agency's classification of the AfD as a "confirmed right-wing extremist" group, a designation currently suspended pending a legal challenge. While the SPD and its Green party allies support the ban, conservative Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has urged caution, preferring to await the court's final ruling on the extremist classification.</p>

          <p>Jens Spahn, a leading figure in Germany's conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary group, has controversially proposed that Europe establish its own nuclear deterrent. Arguing that U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in Germany are no longer a sufficient deterrent against Russian aggression, Spahn suggested Germany and other European nations should seek participation in France's and Great Britain's nuclear arsenals. The proposal was met with sharp criticism from left-leaning parties, who advocate for nuclear non-proliferation and view the idea as dangerously inflammatory.</p>

          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has kicked in, reducing a 25% U.S. tariff on British cars to 10% and allowing manufacturers like Aston Martin and JLR to resume shipments. The higher tariff, imposed by Donald Trump in April, had caused a significant drop in auto exports. While the car industry welcomes the relief, British farmers have criticized the deal, arguing that agricultural concessions, such as for U.S. beef and ethanol, were used as bargaining chips to protect the automotive sector.

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators blocked major roads in Belgrade and other Serbian cities, escalating months of anti-government protests. The protests, initially sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse blamed on corruption, are now calling for the resignation of populist President Aleksandar Vucic and for snap elections. The recent blockades were a direct response to the arrest of numerous protesters following a massive rally the previous night, with Vucic rejecting the demands and accusing foreign powers of fueling the unrest.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russia's muted response to the recent Israeli and U.S. attacks on its ally, Iran, demonstrates Moscow's declining power and credibility on the world stage. The author contends that Russia's costly and protracted war in Ukraine has drained its military and economic resources, leaving it unable to meaningfully support its strategic partners. Moscow's failure to provide significant aid to Iran, beyond verbal condemnations, is presented as the latest example of its waning influence.</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers report experiencing motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency slowing caused by regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. Chinese researchers are exploring solutions, including engineering adjustments and even introducing specific audio tones, to counteract the physiological effects and improve passenger comfort.</p>
