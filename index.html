          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has accused Columbia University of violating federal anti-discrimination laws by allegedly tolerating harassment of Jewish students on campus, potentially jeopardizing its accreditation. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, Columbia's accrediting institution, of the alleged violation. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference after Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. The department requires accreditors to notify member institutions of noncompliance and establish a plan for compliance, which could significantly impact Columbia's eligibility for federal student aid. The university spokesperson stated that the institution is "deeply committed to combating antisemitism on our campus."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that early exposure to beneficial bacteria, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, in newborns can significantly reduce the risk of lung infections. The study, conducted by University College London and the Sanger Institute, analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years. Results indicated that babies with B. longum were less likely to be hospitalized for lung infections, suggesting these bacteria play a crucial role in immune system development. Researchers believe the bacteria interact with the immune system, helping it differentiate between harmful and harmless entities, and this protective effect was more pronounced in babies born via vaginal delivery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. Judge Gordon Gallagher issued the order to prevent irreparable harm, citing concerns about deporting the family without due process. Soliman's wife and children, who are Egyptian citizens, are being held in an immigration detention center in Texas. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing them for the alleged crimes of their relative violates fundamental principles of justice, and a hearing has been scheduled for June 13.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reinstated a travel ban, preventing individuals from a dozen countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and Iran, from entering the United States. The ban, which takes effect on Monday, also includes heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, and Venezuela. Trump asserted that the action is necessary to protect national security and the interests of the United States. This ban follows a previous executive order in 2017 that faced legal challenges and was later upheld by the Supreme Court, and critics argue that the new ban disproportionately affects African nations.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. This review comes amidst concerns, fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, regarding the drug's safety, though the FDA maintains that it has found no new safety concerns in periodic reviews since its approval in 2000. Medical experts argue that the concerns are misguided, as some reported adverse events are normal occurrences during medication abortions. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge to the availability of mifepristone in 2024, preserving access to the drug.</p>

The ban, effective Monday, also imposes heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, and Venezuela. Trump stated that this action is necessary to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people. The list of affected countries is based on a report assessing hostile attitudes toward the U.S. and the national security risk posed by entry from those nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has complied with a judge's order to bring back a Guatemalan man who was wrongly deported to Mexico. This action marks a significant departure from the administration's often defiant stance on immigration matters. The judge's order was issued after it was determined that the man's deportation lacked due process. The man, who had applied for asylum in the U.S., feared persecution in Mexico, and the U.S. government's initial claim that he did not express such fears was found to be erroneous.</p>

          <p>A former marketing executive, Chad Bustos, has filed a lawsuit against Terranea Resort, alleging that he was fired for opposing discriminatory comments made by the resort's president, Ralph Grippo, towards pregnant women.

Bustos alleges that he was retaliated against after reporting Grippo's behavior to human resources. The lawsuit also claims that Grippo has a history of making anti-pregnancy comments and discriminating against pregnant employees.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is reducing its collection of consumer price data, a move that officials claim will have minimal impact. However, economists have cautioned that these cutbacks could undermine confidence in inflation data, especially given the current struggles of the statistical system. This reduction in data collection raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of economic indicators used to assess the state of the economy and inform policy decisions. The long term effects of the data reduction remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have revealed that two men suspected in the bombing of a Palm Springs fertility clinic used a generative artificial intelligence chat program to assist in planning the attack. The FBI's criminal complaint states that Guy Edward Bartkus, the primary suspect, researched how to make powerful explosions using ammonium nitrate and fuel through an AI chat application. This incident marks the second case this year where AI has been implicated in assisting with a bombing or attempted bombing. The rise of generative AI has spurred concerns about the potential for misuse and the need for stronger safety measures.</p>

This criticism reflects growing tensions within the Republican Party regarding Trump's "big, beautiful bill".

          <p>Denmark has become a pioneer in restrictive migration policies, driven by the center-left Social Democrats under Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.

Frederiksen argues that high migration levels threaten social cohesion and welfare, justifying the tough stance. While asylum claims have decreased, critics argue that the policies have damaged Denmark's reputation for respecting international humanitarian law and have alienated citizens with migrant backgrounds.</p>
