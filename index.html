          <p>A small skydiving plane carrying fifteen people crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey. Fourteen individuals, including the pilot, sustained injuries, with three listed in critical condition after being airlifted to a hospital. Officials noted it was remarkable there were no fatalities, attributing the effective emergency response to a recent mass casualty training exercise held at the same airport. The pilot had reported engine trouble before attempting to return to the airport, and the NTSB and FAA are now investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>House Republicans faced significant internal opposition while attempting to pass President Trump's major domestic policy legislation, which includes tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense. The procedural vote to begin debate was delayed and remained uncertain as several GOP members, from both moderate and conservative factions, expressed opposition to changes made by the Senate. Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump actively worked to persuade the holdouts, emphasizing the bill's importance to the party's agenda ahead of a self-imposed deadline.</p>

This move follows a ban implemented in May that required American firms to obtain special licenses before exporting certain semiconductor-related goods and software to China.

Combs, who had been detained since his arrest, will remain in custody pending his sentencing in October, where he faces a maximum of 10 years for each conviction.

          <p>With a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote in the House of Representatives has become a relevant concern, as seen during recent contentious legislative battles. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or a bill results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed and is not approved. This procedure underscores the critical importance of party unity and attendance for the majority party when attempting to pass legislation.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic revival, with fundraising volume surging to its highest level since 2021. New listing volumes jumped to $14 billion in the first half of the year, a massive increase driven by mainland Chinese companies seeking to raise capital. This boom is fueled by several factors, including supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and U.S. delisting fears pushing firms toward Hong Kong. The renewed activity positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is burning uncontrollably in eastern Crete, forcing the mass evacuation of approximately 1,500 people from homes and tourist hotels near the municipality of Ierapetra. Fanned by powerful winds, the blaze has spread rapidly across a 6km front, destroying properties and causing power outages in the settlement of Agia Fotia. Firefighting efforts are being hampered by rugged terrain, dry conditions, and thick smoke, which has drastically reduced visibility. Authorities have placed local hospitals on alert and are bringing in reinforcements to battle the fire.</p>

          <p>In a significant escalation of his public criticism, President Donald Trump has demanded the immediate resignation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to boost the economy, made the call on his Truth Social platform. The demand raises questions about presidential authority, as Fed board members can typically only be removed "for cause." Powell has previously stated he would not step down if asked and that he believes the law does not permit the president to fire him.</p>

          <p>An official inspection has found that investigations into historical child sexual exploitation cases in Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. The report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary noted that some documents had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value. The council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules, but has since agreed to a new, more efficient process with police. The delays specifically impacted two major operations investigating child abuse from the early 2000s.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that women under 55 who use a combination of estrogen and progestin for menopause symptoms may face a higher risk of breast cancer. The research, published in The Lancet Oncology, differentiates between treatments for women with and without a uterus, as the latter can take estrogen alone. The findings indicated that estrogen-only therapy actually reduced breast cancer risk, while the addition of synthetic progestin was associated with a slight increase. This evolving science underscores the importance of personalized medical consultation when considering hormone replacement therapy options.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have detailed the critical evidence that led to the arrest of Bryan Kohberger for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. A key breakthrough came from a knife sheath left at the scene, which contained male DNA that was eventually matched to Kohberger through a Q-tip retrieved from his family's trash. Investigators also used surveillance footage and cell phone data to place Kohberger's car near the crime scene on the night of the attack and multiple times in the preceding months. The evidence was presented as Kohberger formally pleaded guilty to the crimes.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with President Donald Trump securing 48% of their vote in the 2024 election, a substantial increase from 36% in 2020. Political experts suggest this change reflects a growing populist sentiment rather than a simple move to conservatism, driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party's immigration policies. Analysts argue that many Latino voters, particularly naturalized citizens, feel both major parties have failed their community, making them a dynamic and evolving demographic that defies simple categorization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down the Trump administration's policy that effectively banned migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws established by Congress. The order, which was issued on President Trump's first day in office, had been challenged by immigrant rights groups who argued it endangered people fleeing violence. The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>
