          <p>The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) have partnered to encourage new driving license applicants to register as blood donors. This initiative aims to address a critical blood shortage, particularly targeting young people as over half of current donors are over 45. The campaign, which will reach millions annually through emails, mirrors a successful organ donor registration prompt. Hospitals in England require 5,000 daily donations for various treatments, highlighting the urgent need for new donors to maintain a safe supply.</p>

          <p>Beijing has imposed sanctions on five US-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipping giant Hanwha Ocean, accusing the firm of collaborating with Washington on maritime curbs against China. Concurrently, China's Ministry of Transport has launched an investigation into the impact of the US Section 301 probe on its shipping and shipbuilding industries. The probe seeks to identify entities supporting US discriminatory actions, with China vowing countermeasures based on its findings. This marks a significant escalation in trade tensions between the nations.</p>

His attorneys sought a stay for DNA testing of evidence, which was denied by the Missouri Supreme Court, arguing untested evidence could exonerate him. Prosecutors claim Shockley shot Graham over an involuntary manslaughter investigation, presenting circumstantial evidence.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 win against the Milwaukee Brewers in their NLCS opener. These early results set the stage for intense playoff competition as teams vie for a World Series spot.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, boasting a $400 million payroll, secured a 2-1 victory against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series. Despite stranding 11 runners and a chaotic double-play costing them a run, the Dodgers' high-priced talent, including Freddie Freeman's home run and Blake Snell's eight scoreless innings, proved decisive. This win underscored the impact of financial might in overcoming in-game adversity, setting a dominant tone for the series. The Brewers' small-ball strategy ultimately fell short against the Dodgers' individual superiority.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 in Game 1 of the NLCS, largely thanks to Blake Snell's masterful eight-inning, scoreless performance. Snell, a $182-million signing, struck out 10 and faced the minimum batters, overcoming a bizarre fourth-inning double-play that cost the Dodgers a potential grand slam. Freddie Freeman's sixth-inning home run provided the decisive lead, showcasing the team's ability to respond to adversity with star power. Snell's exceptional pitching proved crucial in securing the narrow victory.</p>

          <p>Amazon terminated Palestinian software engineer Ahmed Shahrour after he was suspended for protesting the company's $1.2 billion Project Nimbus contract with the Israeli government. Amazon cited violations of conduct and communication policies, alleging misuse of company resources for non-work-related messages about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Shahrour condemned his firing as retaliation designed to silence Palestinian voices and shield Amazon's involvement in the Gaza conflict. This incident reflects growing employee activism and corporate responses to geopolitical issues within the tech industry.</p>

Newsom stated that institutions already possess the authority to determine such preferences, rendering the bill unnecessary.
