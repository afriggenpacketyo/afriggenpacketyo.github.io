            <p>Global markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, saw positive movement as U.S. futures indicated a potential rise amidst ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff plans. The administration's announcement of exemptions for some consumer electronics from reciprocal tariffs boosted market sentiment, with the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 futures all showing gains. European markets also responded positively to the European Commission's tariff countermeasures pause. However, Chinese markets displayed less enthusiasm due to existing tariffs.

            <p>LVMH shares experienced a significant drop after reporting a decline in first-quarter sales, causing it to temporarily lose its position as the world's largest luxury firm to Herm√®s.

            <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening as job vacancies have fallen to a near four-year low, indicating decreased demand for workers while employment costs are increasing.

The government acknowledges the rising real wages and claims the changes will improve living standards, but the ONS advises caution due to low response rates in its employment survey.</p>

            <p>A long-standing trade dispute between the U.S. and Europe centers on the use of chlorine and other chemicals in U.S. poultry processing, with Europeans dubbing it "chlorinated chicken." While the U.S. industry has largely shifted to organic acids, the EU prohibits any chemical treatment, believing it masks subpar food safety practices. Although European authorities have found no health risks from the chemical washes, the debate highlights differing approaches to food safety: the EU focuses on pre-harvest interventions, while the U.S. emphasizes post-slaughter pathogen reduction.</p>

            <p>Senators Lisa Murkowski and Jon Ossoff have issued a bipartisan rebuke of the White House's decision to terminate a federal contract providing legal representation to unaccompanied migrant children. They argue that ending this contract puts vulnerable children at risk of trafficking and exploitation, hindering their access to a fair legal process. The senators claim the move violates the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which requires HHS to ensure unaccompanied children have legal counsel. The administration agreed to a six-month extension after a court order, but the long-term protection of these children remains uncertain.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A new study suggests that long-term transcendental meditation can reduce stress and slow down the aging process by lowering the expression of genes associated with inflammation and aging. Researchers analyzed gene expression, cognitive function, and hormone levels in participants who practiced transcendental meditation. The study found that older practitioners had faster processing speeds and higher cognitive performance scores. Meditation is increasingly being recognized as a tool to improve mental and physical well-being, with some experts even calling it "weightlifting for the brain."</p>

            <p>The UK government has intervened to ensure British Steel's blast furnaces continue operating by securing a shipment of raw materials from the US. The government seized control of the business after talks with its Chinese owner, Jingye, broke down amid concerns about the plant's future. This move aims to prevent the furnaces from shutting down, which would eliminate the UK's ability to produce virgin steel. The government is seeking a private sector partner for the Scunthorpe site, while Beijing accuses the UK of politicizing trade cooperation.</p>

The idea of removing Trump from the film has been tested before, with mixed reactions from Trump supporters and Macaulay Culkin.</p>
