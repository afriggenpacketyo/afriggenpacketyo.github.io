            <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with the Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman under equalities law, with focus on Prime Minister Starmer's response and potential ministerial actions. The UK is also set to increase its domestic explosives production to reduce reliance on the US and France, a move hailed as an important step by the Defence Secretary. The Financial Times emphasizes rising threats to global growth due to a US-driven trade shock, while the Mirror reports on the sale of trophy hunting trips in Africa. Optimism score: 70</p>

            <p>US Vice President JD Vance is visiting India to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss a bilateral trade deal, a visit considered crucial by the Trump administration amidst escalating trade tensions with China. The discussions will likely cover fairness in trade and expansion of the defense partnership, building on the agenda set during Modi's February visit to the US. India hopes to secure a trade deal within a 90-day pause on tariffs declared by President Trump, who has previously labeled India a "tariff abuser".

            <p>China has cautioned nations against appeasing the US in trade talks related to President Trump's tariffs, asserting that compromise cannot earn respect. This warning comes in response to reports that Washington intends to pressure countries into restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from US import taxes. China maintains that all parties should uphold fairness and defend international economic and trade rules. Since Trump's inauguration, a series of tariff announcements have been made, with the US president aiming to encourage domestic consumption and investment. Optimism score: 55</p>

Bukele directly appealed to President Nicolás Maduro on social media, also mentioning nearly 50 prisoners of other nationalities, including US citizens, as part of the proposed swap. The US has deported these Venezuelans, accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang and paying El Salvador to detain them.

This incident occurred around the same time Hegseth shared similar operational details in another Signal chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information.

While the season includes moments of ingenuity, particularly in exploring Ellie and Joel's relationship, the show's unrelenting cheerlessness and limited imagination make it a punishing watch.

            <p>President Trump is threatening to cut an additional $1 billion in funding for Harvard University, this time targeting health research, as the administration's conflict with elite schools escalates. This action follows the withholding of government funding from Harvard, Columbia, and other universities over their handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and alleged antisemitism. Trump officials reportedly felt that Harvard released a confidential list of demands to the public, leading to the increased pressure. Since his inauguration, Trump has cracked down on top U.S. universities, citing mishandling of protests and the intensification of antisemitism on campus. Optimism score: 30</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," defined as nonsexual unions, are gaining traction as a means to provide partnership outside traditional societal norms. These marriages often involve individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ but seek the practical advantages and social security benefits of marriage. A Tokyo-based agency has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade, with couples citing reasons like wanting a life partner or giving their parents peace of mind. While same-sex marriage remains unrecognized in Japan, friendship marriages offer a "desperate measure" with added practical rewards. Optimism score: 75</p>

The rollout of "free hours" has not been a panacea, with nursery places increasingly difficult to find and a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out. Private nurseries face rising operating costs, while local authority-run nurseries are declining.
