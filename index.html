          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from clinching the National League West title following a 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The team overcame a struggling bullpen, which surrendered a late-game lead for the second consecutive night. Crucial to the win were scoreless relief appearances from starters Roki Sasaki, in his return from the injured list, and Clayton Kershaw, who pitched his first relief inning since 2019. Tommy Edman drove in the decisive run in the 11th inning to secure the important victory.</p>

          <p>An Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, has intensified discussions among Arab and Islamic nations about forming a collective security pact, sometimes referred to as an "Islamic NATO." The attack has shaken assumptions in Gulf states about the reliability of U.S. security guarantees, prompting calls for greater strategic autonomy and regional cooperation. While a formal, NATO-style treaty is considered unrealistic by experts, there is growing momentum for enhanced intelligence sharing and joint military exercises, particularly among Gulf Cooperation Council members, Turkey, and Egypt.</p>

          <p>Denmark's Aalborg airport was forced to close after unauthorized drones were sighted in its airspace, an incident that also affected military operations at the shared base. Three other smaller airports in the country also reported drone activity, though they remained open. This event follows a similar drone incursion that shut down Copenhagen's main airport earlier in the week, which the Prime Minister described as a severe attack on national infrastructure. Police are investigating the source and motive behind the drones, which have heightened security concerns across Europe.</p>

          <p>A jewelry store in San Ramon, California, which had been robbed previously, utilized innovative security measures to thwart a recent heist by a large group of armed suspects. As between 20 and 25 individuals smashed display cases, the store's security system activated, locking the front door and temporarily trapping them inside. Although the suspects eventually shot their way out, the delay allowed law enforcement to track their getaway vehicles using helicopters and drones. The enhanced security, combined with a tracker in a stolen watch from a previous robbery, has led to multiple arrests.</p>

          <p>As Canada experiences its second-worst wildfire season on record, a dispute has erupted with nearby U.S. states over the resulting cross-border smoke pollution. Republican lawmakers from several Midwestern states have filed a formal complaint with the EPA, urging an investigation into Canada's fire management and demanding accountability. In response, Canadian officials have called the complaints political games, with experts on both sides pointing to human-caused climate change as the root cause of the longer, more intense fire seasons affecting both nations, suggesting collaboration is needed instead of blame.</p>

          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey is starring in "The Lost Bus," a film depicting the true story of a school bus driver who saved children during California's deadly 2018 Camp Fire. The production became a family affair, with McConaughey's 93-year-old mother, Kay, and his 17-year-old son, Levi, cast to play his character's mother and son, respectively. Director Paul Greengrass, known for his focus on realism, cast them after they submitted auditions, aiming to bring an authentic family dynamic to the intense real-life drama about survival and split-second decisions amid a catastrophic event.</p>

The move was prompted by a recent case where a woman was charged with felonies for allegedly registering her dog to vote and casting ballots in its name. While the registrar of voters has found no other instances in an initial check, the expanded review aims to bolster public confidence in the integrity of the voting system ahead of an upcoming special election.</p>

          <p>Internal documents from England's Environment Agency (EA) reveal that the watchdog failed to send investigators to nearly a third of all serious water pollution incidents caused by the water industry in the past year. The data shows the agency often relied on reports from the water companies themselves, who may have been responsible for the pollution, and downgraded over 1,000 potentially serious incidents without a site visit. An insider claims this lack of attendance means the agency is primarily using company-provided evidence, undermining its regulatory effectiveness and accountability.</p>

Obama also criticized progressives for becoming "complacent" and "smug" in the past, suggesting their values are now being genuinely tested by this resurgence of populist and conservative ideologies.</p>

          <p>The return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following the host's weeklong suspension drew an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, approximately four times its seasonal average. The episode, which addressed Kimmel's controversial remarks about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, also achieved the show's highest rating in the key 18-49 demographic since 2015. The viewership spike occurred despite the show being preempted by ABC affiliates owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, which together cover nearly a quarter of the U.S. market, who have continued their boycott indefinitely.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded an investigation into what he termed a "triple sabotage" during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly. In a social media post, he detailed three incidents: an escalator abruptly stopping, his teleprompter failing during his speech, and a faulty audio system in the auditorium. The UN explained that the escalator's safety function may have been inadvertently triggered by a videographer. Trump, however, dismissed these as coincidences and asserted the events were a deliberate and disgraceful effort to undermine his appearance.</p>

The letter suggests that Disney's board may have breached its fiduciary duties by succumbing to improper political pressure from the FCC chairman and affiliate station owners, leading to a $4 billion drop in the company's stock value. The shareholders are threatening a derivative lawsuit if the company fails to provide a transparent explanation for the decision-making process behind the suspension.</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump imposing a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications is causing alarm among U.S. businesses, particularly startups and smaller firms. While the fee currently applies only to future applicants, companies in tech, healthcare, and other sectors argue that such a cost is prohibitive and will cripple their ability to hire skilled foreign workers. Critics warn the policy could stifle innovation, lead to a "brain drain," and encourage companies to offshore operations rather than hire domestically, ultimately harming U.S. economic growth.

The district attorney's office, which had recommended a 10-year sentence, objected to the judge's decision, stating that it minimizes the gravity of the crime and disregards the jury's verdict.</p>
