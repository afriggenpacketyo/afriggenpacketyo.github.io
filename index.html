            <p>Japan's Prime Minister has committed to reviewing non-tariff barriers affecting the automotive industry during upcoming discussions with the United States. This pledge signals a potential shift in trade relations and an effort to address concerns raised by the U.S. regarding access to the Japanese auto market. The review aims to identify and potentially dismantle regulations or practices that may hinder U.S. auto exports to Japan, fostering a more equitable trading environment.
