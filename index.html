          <p>A 12-year-old pitcher from Chinese Taipei, Lin Chin-Tse, has become a standout at the 2025 Little League World Series for his exceptionally fast pitches. During a game against Mexico, the young right-hander threw consecutive fastballs that were clocked at over 80 mph, a remarkable speed for his age group. His performance was a major topic of discussion following his team's 3-0 victory, which allowed them to advance in the international bracket. The feat highlights the high level of talent present at the annual youth baseball tournament in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Puerto Rico have arrested and charged a suspect in connection with the killing of a 25-year-old tourist from New York. The victim, Kevin Mares, was visiting the island for a Bad Bunny concert when he was struck by a stray bullet at a nightspot in the La Perla community. Police state Mares was an innocent bystander during an argument in which the suspect, Kalel Jorell Martínez Bristol, allegedly fired a gun. The incident has once again raised concerns about tourist safety in the historic area, which has experienced isolated acts of violence despite its popularity.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in California that can be sold as a condominium, separate from the main property it is built on. This development follows a city law passed a year ago aimed at creating more affordable homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this new type of housing, often called a granny flat or in-law unit, will serve as a more accessible starter home amid the state's severe housing crisis. While ADUs have grown in popularity and now account for a significant portion of new housing growth, their overall impact on the statewide housing shortage is still being evaluated.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the AI transcription service Otter.ai, accusing the company of secretly recording and using private conversations to train its artificial intelligence without user consent. The complaint, filed in a California federal court, alleges that Otter's popular notetaking tool for platforms like Zoom and Google Meet violates federal and state wiretap laws. The lawsuit claims the service often records meetings without notifying all participants and that its process for anonymizing data is not transparent or effective. This legal challenge highlights growing privacy concerns as AI tools become more integrated into professional environments.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Salton Sea Shoreline a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution</h2>

          <p>A new report suggests that dust from the exposed shoreline of California's shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the surrounding Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects have focused on the lakebed to combat high rates of asthma and respiratory issues in the region. The study indicates that the pollution is a complex mix from numerous sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. Researchers now suggest that efforts might be more effective if they pivot from source control to protecting people indoors with air filters and weatherized homes.</p>

During his trip, Khan met with Turkish-Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, a move condemned by the Cypriot government.

          <p>New research from India is challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. Two recent clinical trials found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like white bread, could actually improve blood sugar levels and other metabolic health markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes. One study showed that post-meal glucose fluctuations were smaller after eating a mango compared to bread. Researchers emphasize that portion control is critical and that these findings do not grant a license for unlimited consumption, but they offer hope for integrating the popular fruit into a managed diabetic diet.</p>

The artwork is part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship and is located on the side of a future restaurant.

Following the nearly three-hour discussion, Trump stated he would consult with NATO allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the talks. The meeting was a key part of Trump's campaign promise to end the conflict, but the lack of a concrete deal highlights the ongoing complexities of the diplomatic situation.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings is experiencing a significant resurgence after a nearly three-year downturn caused by inflation and high interest rates. Several recent tech IPOs, including those for Figma, Circle, and Bullish, have seen their stock prices soar on their first day of trading, signaling renewed investor appetite. Wall Street analysts and exchange CEOs are optimistic that this trend will continue, potentially opening the floodgates for a backlog of high-value private companies to go public. The renewed activity suggests growing confidence in the market's stability and a return to growth-focused investment. (not investment advice)</p>

After scoring, players Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike both made gestures referencing Jota's signature celebration and jersey number. The tributes continued after the match, with players and manager Arne Slot acknowledging the powerful and somber atmosphere created by the fans to honor the beloved player.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok focusing on authoritarian repression was censored after complaints from the Chinese government, leading the Burmese curator to flee Thailand and seek asylum in the UK. The show, held at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, featured works by exiled artists, including those from Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang. Chinese embassy officials reportedly demanded the removal of sensitive artworks, resulting in artists' names being painted over and video screens being turned off. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an act of transnational repression and a violation of freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make electric pickup trucks more affordable by focusing on simplicity and customization. The company's compact, two-seat truck is designed as a barebones vehicle, allowing owners to add features and accessories as they see fit, including converting it into a five-seat SUV. This approach aims to lower the initial manufacturing cost and sticker price, a major barrier for many EV buyers. However, with the rollback of federal EV incentives, the truck's price point may become less competitive against existing budget-friendly models like the Ford Maverick.</p>

The agreement was reached after D.C. filed a lawsuit and sought an emergency restraining order against what it called a "hostile takeover."

One complaint claims a 10-year-old was sexually exploited by a predator who posed as a child on the platform. The lawsuits, filed in multiple states, argue that Roblox prioritizes profit over user safety and misrepresents its platform as a safe environment for kids. In response, Roblox has stated it has rigorous safeguards in place and is using AI to detect child endangerment, but it continues to face intense legal and political pressure over its safety protocols.</p>
