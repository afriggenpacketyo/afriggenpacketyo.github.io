          <p>President Trump refuted claims of contact with Iranian leaders and cautioned Tehran against targeting U.S. assets. Speaking after returning early from the G7 summit, Trump dismissed intelligence assessments suggesting Iran wasn't pursuing nuclear weapons, asserting they were close to obtaining one. He emphasized that if Iran wants to negotiate, they know how to reach him, reiterating that they missed a chance to make a deal that would have saved lives. Trump's remarks follow escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with the U.S. remaining on the sidelines of the conflict so far. </p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to lower-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely to achieve break-even operating margins this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline will reduce off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, and pause the retrofit of some older Airbus A320 jets. The carrier is also reevaluating hiring plans and considering combining leadership roles to reduce travel spending. This announcement follows the blocked acquisition of Spirit Airlines and a previous blocked alliance with American Airlines, pushing JetBlue to seek new strategies to increase revenue and cut costs. </p>

          <p>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jan Schakowsky are challenging five major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, regarding their low tax bills and lobbying efforts. They accuse these companies of exploiting a loophole in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by shifting profits to offshore subsidiaries. The lawmakers are questioning whether the companies' lobbying efforts are aimed at maintaining this tax loophole in the proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The bill is currently in the Senate, where Democrats face an uphill battle to eliminate the offshore tax loophole due to Republican control. </p>

MiniMax cited benchmarks showing that M1 matches the performance of leading global models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic in maths, coding, and domain knowledge.

          <p>U.S. retail sales experienced a greater-than-expected drop of 0.9% in May, signaling a sharp pullback in consumer spending. The decline, attributed to falling gas sales and economic unease, exceeded the anticipated 0.6% decrease. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.3%. Despite the overall decrease, certain sectors like miscellaneous retailers and online sales saw gains.

          <p>Medical experts are cautioning about the potential harm to brain health from the over-the-counter medication ingredient doxylamine succinate, found in some sleep aids and first-generation antihistamines. Long-term use of these medications can lead to cognitive decline, memory loss, and an increased risk of dementia, especially in older patients. These medications block acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential for memory and learning. Safer alternatives for allergies include newer antihistamines like loratadine and cetirizine, while cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is recommended for sleep issues. </p>

The norms that fostered restraint in the past are now weaker, raising concerns about the potential for violence. The current deployment of Marines without accompanying military police trained in crowd control is an unsettling departure from previous practices. </p>
