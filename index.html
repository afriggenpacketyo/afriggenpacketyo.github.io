          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, continues to make strides in his pitching comeback, striking out six batters in three simulated innings during a recent practice. Ohtani has been sidelined from the mound since undergoing right elbow surgery in September 2023 while playing for the Los Angeles Angels, however his recent practice at Petco Park showcased his command and variety of pitches, with his fastest pitch reaching 96 miles per hour. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism, suggesting there's a possibility Ohtani could return as a pitcher before the All-Star break, with pitching coach Mark Prior praising Ohtani's control and ability to execute any pitch he desired. This progress marks a significant step towards Ohtani's return to the mound, a highly anticipated event for Dodgers fans and baseball enthusiasts alike. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown L.A. from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. to address vandalism and looting during ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew applies to a one-square-mile area bounded by the 5, 110, and 10 Freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and those experiencing homelessness. Protests have persisted for five days following immigration raids, resulting in nearly 469 arrests and looting of 23 businesses, prompting the deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines. The Trump administration defends the deployment as necessary to protect federal property, while Governor Newsom accuses Trump of inciting violence and has initiated legal action. </p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, Dr. Andrew Rentschler, a biomechanist and defense witness, testified that a 15 mph collision between a crash dummy's head and a taillight similar to Read's Lexus would not have resulted in a skull fracture. Rentschler's testimony supports the defense's theory that John O'Keefe's injuries were inconsistent with a car collision, suggesting a backward fall as a more plausible cause. He joins other defense witnesses in disputing the prosecution's claim that scratches on O'Keefe's arm were caused by the taillight impact, attributing them instead to a possible dog bite. Karen Read has announced that she will not testify in her own defense, and Rentschler is expected to be the final witness called by her legal team. </p>

He argues that capital punishment goes against the spirit of democracy and respects human rights, citing the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals.

The agreement follows a phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, aiming to calm tensions caused by disagreements over visas, minerals, and microchips. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the framework seeks to implement the Geneva consensus, requiring approval from both leaders before implementation. The disputes had threatened a fragile truce reached in Geneva last month, which included a 90-day suspension of tariffs, but the new framework signals a potential thaw in relations. </p>
