          <p>The death of a 13-year-old Arizona girl, Melony Granados, has been ruled a homicide, with authorities alleging she was kept in a "makeshift cage" by her grandmother, Virginia Lujan. Granados, who had severe epilepsy and cognitive impairments, died from extensive bruising after Lujan called 911. Lujan, previously charged with child abuse, died of natural causes in custody last month, but the medical examiner's report confirmed the homicide ruling. Investigators found the home in unsanitary conditions and a bunk bed converted into an enclosure with human waste.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its agreement to significant parts of President Trump's Gaza ceasefire proposal, including the release of all hostages, though it seeks further negotiations on other elements. The U.S. views this response positively, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu having previously accepted the deal. Trump urged Israel to halt bombing in Gaza to ensure safe hostage release, expressing belief that Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." The proposal includes an immediate end to fighting and a withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed line.</p>

          <p>Apple and Google removed apps, including "ICEBlock," that alert users to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, following pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi and the White House. Critics argue this capitulation demonstrates the Trump administration's influence over Silicon Valley and constitutes "jawboning," a form of government censorship. The app's developer, Joshua Aaron, called the move a violation of constitutional rights, comparing it to Apple's own mapping features that crowdsource police locations. This action has reignited debates about free expression and tech companies' deference to government demands.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates widespread apprehension among Americans regarding political violence, with an overwhelming majority deeming it unacceptable yet anticipating an increase in the coming years. This concern spans all political affiliations, with older Americans particularly emphasizing its unacceptability. The poll also highlights pessimism about different political groups uniting and a decline in comfort with publicly expressing political views. Many perceive negative outcomes like insults or employment problems for those who do, further exacerbating societal divisions.</p>

          <p>Sophie Roske, who pleaded guilty to attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022, was sentenced to eight years and one month in prison. Roske, who called police on herself before the attack, apologized to Kavanaugh and his family, expressing remorse for her "selfish and misguided" actions. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year sentence, citing the preplanned nature and "terroristic purposes" of the crime, which involved traveling from California with weapons. The judge considered Roske's mental health issues but emphasized the seriousness of threatening judicial independence.</p>

          <p>California officials and labor leaders are demanding an audit of Los Angeles County's $4 billion sexual assault settlement and a State Bar investigation into Downtown LA Law Group (DTLA). This follows a Los Angeles Times report revealing some plaintiffs claimed vendors paid them to sue the county, with two alleging they were instructed to fabricate claims. DTLA denies involvement, but the allegations raise concerns about "capping," an illegal practice of soliciting clients for law firms. The controversy threatens to undermine trust in the justice system and the legitimacy of claims by genuine survivors of abuse.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly approved military operations involving drone attacks on two Gaza-bound humanitarian aid vessels off the Tunisian coast last month. U.S. intelligence officials stated that incendiary devices were dropped onto the boats, causing fires but no casualties. The Global Sumud Flotilla, which organized the mission, condemned the attacks as recklessly endangering civilians and called for independent investigations. Israel has maintained a naval blockade of Gaza for over a decade, and these alleged actions highlight ongoing tensions and the controversial tactics employed in the region.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark bill allowing hundreds of thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers in California to unionize and bargain collectively while retaining their independent contractor status. This compromise between labor groups and gig economy companies follows years of legal disputes over driver classification. The new law provides a framework for drivers to form unions by collecting signatures, exempting them from antitrust laws that typically prohibit collective action by independent contractors. This development aims to give drivers a stronger voice in negotiating pay and working conditions, while also reducing the companies' insurance requirements.</p>

The deadlock centers on healthcare funding, with Democrats seeking to extend subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, while Republicans accuse them of trying to fund healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The White House warned of potential mass layoffs of federal workers if the shutdown continues, with President Trump vowing to target "Democrat agencies."

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's injunction, determining that the Trump administration's executive order to narrow birthright citizenship is likely unconstitutional. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of plaintiff states, citing the 14th Amendment's long-standing interpretation that citizenship is automatically granted to most individuals born on U.S. soil. This decision marks another legal setback for the Trump administration's efforts to restrict birthright citizenship, a concept historically challenged but consistently affirmed by legal precedent.

The proposal involves a phased Israeli withdrawal and a temporary technocratic government in Gaza, but core disagreements persist. Experts suggest both sides might agree in principle but prolong negotiations, making true peace contingent on sustained dialogue and potential external pressure, which has been inconsistently applied.</p>

          <p>Munich Airport has repeatedly suspended operations due to "unconfirmed drone sightings," causing flight diversions and cancellations, and stranding thousands of passengers. The disruptions occurred twice within 24 hours, with one drone also spotted over a nearby German military facility. German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt called the incidents a "wake-up call," emphasizing the escalating challenge of drone threats. While authorities haven't publicly blamed anyone, some European officials suggest Russia is behind similar airspace violations, contributing to a broader sense of insecurity in the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has, for a second time, allowed the Trump administration to cancel Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans. This decision overturns lower court rulings and means thousands could lose jobs, face detention, and be deported to a country deemed unsafe. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented, with Jackson criticizing the "grave misuse of our emergency docket" while lives are at stake. The ruling creates a "bizarre situation" where some individuals may retain status based on prior documentation, highlighting the arbitrary nature of the legal reversals.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Considers Minting $1 Coin Featuring President Trump for U.S. 250th Anniversary</h2>

          <p>The Treasury Department is exploring minting a $1 commemorative coin for the United States' 250th anniversary next year, potentially featuring President Donald Trump's likeness on both sides. Initial drafts depict Trump's profile on one side and a defiant image of him raising his fist, with the words "FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT," on the other. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed the drafts, noting they reflect the nation's "enduring spirit." However, federal law traditionally prohibits depicting living presidents on circulating coins and restricts portraits on the reverse side of commemorative coins, raising questions about the legality of the design.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump’s Justice Department is reportedly firing experienced counterterrorism prosecutors and experts, raising alarms about political interference compromising national security. Michael Ben’Ary, head of national security at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, was dismissed based on false accusations, while George Toscas, a seasoned anti-terrorist attorney, was sidelined for encouraging an investigation into classified documents. These removals are seen as undermining the expertise crucial for prosecuting terrorism cases, potentially jeopardizing national security. Critics argue these personnel decisions are politically motivated, not based on merit.</p>

          <p>Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and a key figure behind the conservative "Project 2025" blueprint, is being positioned as President Trump's enforcer during the ongoing government shutdown. Trump views the shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to implement dramatic cuts to federal government programs and agencies, leveraging Vought's expertise in budget reductions. Vought has already announced holds on major infrastructure projects and cancellations of clean energy initiatives. This strategy, though criticized by Democrats and some Republicans, reflects a determined effort to reshape the federal bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou maintains the immediate support of the club's hierarchy despite a winless streak of six matches since his appointment. Owner Evangelos Marinakis has offered assistance, and the board acknowledges mitigating circumstances for the poor start, including refereeing decisions. However, Sunday's match against Newcastle is considered crucial for Postecoglou, with the manner of performance as important as the result. A heavy defeat could lead to internal scrutiny, but Postecoglou remains confident, citing his previous success at Tottenham despite facing similar pressure.</p>

          <p>Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim admits his team's dire record, with only 18 wins in 49 matches, makes criticism from club legends like Wayne Rooney "normal." Despite senior sources indicating Sir Jim Ratcliffe's continued support, Amorim acknowledges the need for results to sustain the project, especially with another international break approaching. He insists he will not resign, viewing it as a board decision, but admits the frustrations of losing. The club is also planning money-spinning mid-season friendlies to compensate for lost European revenue, a decision Amorim supports given the financial context.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch announced that the Conservative Party will withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if they win the next election. This policy shift, driven by a legal review suggesting the ECHR hinders migration reform and affects military veterans, aims to "protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens." Labour criticized the move as a capitulation to internal party pressure. The announcement, made on the eve of the party conference, signals a central election theme, despite warnings from legal experts about potential political and legal consequences, including impacts on the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
