          <p>Two men, Adam Carruthers and Daniel Graham, were found guilty of criminal damage for cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap tree in northern England, a crime that sparked widespread sadness and anger. The tree, a beloved symbol of the area, stood for 150 years along Hadrian‚Äôs Wall and was featured in the film ‚ÄúRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves‚Äù. Evidence suggested the motive was simply vandalism and a desire to create a spectacle, with cellphone data placing both men at the scene. Despite their denials, the jury delivered a unanimous verdict, and the men will be sentenced in July, facing up to 10 years in prison, while sprouts have already been spotted at the base of the stump, offering hope for its regeneration.</p>

          <p>Vice President Vance stated that the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan are ‚Äúfundamentally none of our business,‚Äù signaling a shift towards a more hands-off foreign policy. This statement came as the two nations exchanged fire, reaching previously untouched areas and raising concerns about potential nuclear conflict. While the administration pursues de-escalation through diplomatic channels, analysts worry Vance's comments might embolden both sides, especially concerning the disputed region of Kashmir. The current tensions arose after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, with India blaming Pakistani proxies, a claim Pakistan denies, heightening regional instability.</p>

          <p>Randy Carr, CEO of World Emblem, faces the challenges of on-again-off-again tariffs, which threaten his company's operations. World Emblem, which makes embroidered patches, heavily relies on its large factory in Mexico, and Carr feared potential tariffs could force a costly relocation to the United States. When tariffs were announced, Carr initially saw an opportunity to undercut Chinese competitors, but soon realized that tariffs on raw materials and a potential recession would hurt his business too. The article highlights the complexities of international trade and the impact of tariffs on businesses, even those seemingly positioned to benefit.</p>

          <p>Tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon reported strong first-quarter ad sales, exceeding analyst expectations. However, executives expressed caution about the rest of the year due to potential economic headwinds from tariffs.

Other companies like Pinterest and Snap echoed similar concerns about slower Asia-specific ad sales and broader macroeconomic uncertainty, with Snap even pulling its second-quarter guidance due to the unpredictable economy.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a recent court ruling that favored the game maker. The ruling stated that Apple cannot charge commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return after being removed in 2020 for circumventing Apple's payment system. While Apple could still reject the submission, this move represents a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple.

          <p>The first Chinese freight ships carrying goods subject to President Trump's 145%-plus tariffs are arriving at U.S. ports, with over 12,000 shipping containers affected. Companies like Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, Ralph Lauren, and Tractor Supply have a wide range of consumer items in these containers. Trump suggested he was willing to lower tariffs on China to 80%, but the confusion surrounding the tariffs has led businesses to continually alter their scenario planning. The number of freight vessels and shipping containers headed to the U.S. from China has plummeted since the tariff announcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested a willingness to lower tariffs on China from 145% to 80%, a move that arrives a day before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to begin trade negotiations with Chinese officials. While this potential reduction may avert a virtual standstill of trade, analysts say it would not substantially ease expected price increases for goods. The risk of product shortages would also remain at the lower tariff rate. The uncertainty surrounding trade policy changes makes it difficult for companies to adapt their supply chains and offer relief for consumers.</p>

          <p>The US-UK trade deal on steel tariffs includes conditions on the "nature of ownership" of British plants to prevent Chinese steel from circumventing US tariffs. The Trump administration sought assurances that the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe would not be used as a backdoor by Beijing. While the deal has been welcomed by the car and steel industries, some terms remain unclear. The agreement will lower car tariffs to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if certain conditions are met, but the exact requirements for the quota of steel allowed to be exported tariff-free are still being defined.</p>
