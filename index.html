          <p>A Russian aerial assault on Kyiv resulted in the deaths of six individuals, including a six-year-old boy, after missiles struck multiple residential areas. The head of the city's military administration reported that a building in the Sviatoshynskyi district suffered a direct hit, one of 27 locations targeted overnight. At least 52 people were injured in the attacks, with over 30, including nine children, requiring hospitalization. Ukrainian officials described the event as a brutal strike on civilian infrastructure, noting that search and rescue operations were underway for people potentially trapped under the rubble.</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have declared their intention to officially recognize the state of Palestine this September, aligning with recent announcements from France and the United Kingdom. The move is aimed at increasing pressure for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the recognition is contingent on the Palestinian Authority holding elections in 2026 without Hamas's involvement and demilitarizing. This decision by three G7 nations signals a significant shift in Western policy, though it is opposed by Israel and the United States, who argue it legitimizes terrorism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's pioneering national ban on social media for young people, framed as a response to a youth mental health crisis, is facing scrutiny from some experts. While the policy enjoys broad public support, specialists like Professor Marilyn Campbell argue there is little causal evidence linking social media directly to deteriorating psychological health. Critics suggest the government is opting for a simple but potentially ineffective solution instead of investing in more complex mental health system reforms. The article also notes that social media can provide vital support for marginalized youth and that a ban may not adequately prepare them for a technologically-driven world.</p>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that nearly half of British adults are either postponing having children or deciding against it entirely, with financial concerns being the predominant factor. The cost of raising children, including childcare expenses, was the most cited reason, according to the Ipsos survey. This trend aligns with record-low birth rates in England and Wales, with deaths projected to outnumber births from 2030. Experts and politicians acknowledge the issue, pointing to an unfriendly tax system and the high cost of housing as systemic problems constraining family planning decisions for many.</p>

          <p>A system outage at the UK's national air traffic control provider, NATS, caused significant disruption, leading to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounding thousands more. Although the issue was resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, the knock-on effects are expected to last for days during the peak summer travel season. Airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, have expressed frustration, demanding answers and criticizing NATS for the repeat failure, referencing a similar major outage in August 2023. The government is now working with NATS to investigate the cause of the radar-related incident.</p>

          <p>Shanghai-based Wuxi AppTec has successfully raised US$981 million through a share placement in Hong Kong, reflecting growing investor appetite for Chinese biotechnology firms. The company sold 73.8 million new shares to institutional investors at a 6.9 percent discount, with proceeds intended to fund global expansion and increase production capacity. This move follows similar successful capital-raising efforts by other Chinese drug developers like Innovent Biologics and Ascentage Pharma. The trend is reportedly driven by mainland investors actively buying shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese pharmaceutical companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats in Texas are criticizing a new Republican-led proposal to redraw the state's congressional maps, calling it a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" plan. The draft map would shift five Democrat-held U.S. House districts into GOP-leaning territories, a move blessed by President Trump. Critics argue the plan intentionally fractures Black and Latino communities to dilute their voting power and is a "likely violation of the Voting Rights Act." The contentious proposal is part of a high-stakes political battle as Republicans aim to protect their narrow House majority in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

She described the experience as a beautiful reprieve after a difficult period and expressed immense gratitude to the public for selecting her work. Born in the Philippines, Spirovski's art is influenced by her mixed European-Asian heritage and her life in both countries.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Colorado dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela, by poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic, cyanide, and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors argued the crime was premeditated and driven by greed, pointing to a struggling dental practice, $4 million in life insurance policies, and extramarital affairs. Craig's internet search history included queries about undetectable poisons. The conviction carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole, bringing a legal conclusion to a case that family members described as losing both a mother and a father.</p>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction and missing analyst expectations. The decline is attributed to a combination of seasonal factors, extreme weather events, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for new orders, employment, and raw materials inventory also remained in contraction territory, signaling broad-based weakness in the industrial sector. The slowdown aligns with forecasts for slower economic growth in the second half of the year as the impact of U.S. tariffs becomes more apparent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat has suggested that the European Union's recent trade agreement with the United States could deepen the bloc's economic and security dependence on Washington. Shi Mingde, China's former ambassador to Germany, argued that this increased reliance contradicts the EU's goal of achieving strategic autonomy. He made the comments while discussing the EU's "de-risking" policy aimed at reducing reliance on China. From Beijing's perspective, the EU is trading one form of dependency for another, potentially weakening its ability to act independently on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Ford has revised its forecast for the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion this year. The automaker, which manufactures most of its vehicles in the U.S., has already paid an extra $800 million in duties in the second quarter. The increased cost is attributed to higher-than-expected levies on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. This announcement underscores the significant financial strain that President Trump's trade policies are placing on major American corporations, even those with substantial domestic operations.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The bill, AB 379, was controversial, with some Democrats initially concerned it could be used to unfairly target minorities. After amendments were made to target older offenders specifically, the bill passed, also creating a support fund for survivors financed by increased fines on offenders and non-compliant hoteliers.</p>
