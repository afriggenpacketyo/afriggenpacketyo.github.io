          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules for foreign workers could lead to significant labor shortages in key sectors. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for work visas, aiming to prioritize British workers. However, businesses fear that they will struggle to find enough British personnel to fill the gap, particularly in sectors like health and social care, where migrant workers are heavily relied upon. Care England warns that ending overseas recruitment for social care visas could have serious consequences, as the industry already faces a substantial number of vacancies.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, potentially paving the way for their release after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation efforts in prison, swayed by letters from corrections officials supporting their release. While the judge emphasized that he was not suggesting immediate release, he believed they deserved a chance at parole, leaving their fate in the hands of Governor Gavin Newsom and the state parole board. The brothers apologized for their crimes, acknowledging the pain they caused their relatives, while the district attorney's office maintained its opposition, arguing they haven't fully accepted responsibility.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has approved a potential sale of over $1.4 billion in helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to the United Arab Emirates, coinciding with President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to the Middle Eastern nation. The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16s parts, which has been notified to Congress for review. However, some Democrats have signaled potential opposition due to concerns over the UAE's involvement in conflicts and alleged dealings with Trump's businesses. Senator Chris Murphy has vowed to block arms sales to countries engaging in personal business with Trump, citing potential corruption.</p>

Sony also disclosed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, with a listing expected this year. The company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March was more subdued, forecasting a slight increase in operating profit due to the impact of U.S. tariffs.</p>

This talent crunch is due to both a lack of qualified candidates and the selectivity of family offices, which prioritize trust above all else. Some families are willing to pay a premium for trusted individuals, but the informal structure and unclear career progression within family offices make them less appealing to younger employees.</p>

Despite this drop, egg prices remain significantly higher than the previous year due to the ongoing outbreak of bird flu, which has wiped out numerous egg-laying hens. Experts predict that egg prices will continue to decline in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures, and the Department of Justice is investigating Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. egg producer.</p>

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the federal sexual assault and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, detailing drug-fueled sex sessions orchestrated by Combs that made her feel disgusted and humiliated. Ventura described freak-offs that could last for days, involving drug use and sex with strangers, and alleged that Combs dictated her sex acts and appearance. She stated that she stayed in the relationship to keep Combs happy, but eventually recognized his increasing abuse and control over her career. The judge denied a request to downplay Ventura's visible pregnancy during her testimony.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced the majority of their recently imposed tariffs on each other's imports and suspended a portion of the reciprocal duties for a 90-day period. The agreement was reached during trade discussions in Switzerland, where the US reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, and China lowered its tariffs on US goods from 125% to 10%. However, both countries will maintain some tariffs, with further negotiations planned to address the remaining issues. China has also agreed to suspend non-tariff measures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals.</p>

          <p>Scientists have documented wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, demonstrating a form of "forest first aid." The research, conducted in the Budongo Forest, builds on previous findings that chimps self-medicate by eating certain plants. The chimpanzees were observed dabbing plants on wounds and applying chewed plant material to injuries, and researchers also found records of chimps tending to the wounds of others. This discovery adds to the growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to maintain their health in the wild and suggests a capacity for empathy in chimpanzees.</p>

China's actions include warnings against external forces threatening its borders and continued assertiveness in the South China Sea and near disputed islands with Japan.
