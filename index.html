          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that a significant portion of the population, 44.7%, desires rice prices lower than those promised by the Prime Minister. This suggests a potential disconnect between governmental agricultural policy and consumer expectations. The survey highlights ongoing concerns about the affordability of staple foods and the effectiveness of current economic measures in addressing these concerns. The survey underscores the need for the government to re-evaluate its approach to rice pricing to better align with the needs and financial realities of Japanese citizens. </p>

          <p>North Korean authorities have detained three shipyard officials after a failed destroyer launch, with leader Kim Jong Un blaming them for "carelessness and irresponsibility." The 5,000-ton-class ship, Pyongyang's second known destroyer, sustained damage to its stern during the launch ceremony. While North Korea claims the damage is not severe and repairs will take only 10 days, observers suggest it could take longer.
