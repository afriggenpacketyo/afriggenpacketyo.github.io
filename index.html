          <p>Hull KR achieved a historic treble by defeating the Wigan Warriors 24-6 in the Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford. This victory marks the first time the Robins have won the league championship since 1984 and makes them only the fifth team to win a Grand Final. Having already secured the Challenge Cup and the League Leaders' Shield this season, the win cements a dominant year for the team. A crucial moment came when Wigan's Brad O'Neill received a yellow card, allowing Hull KR to score two decisive tries and establish a lead they would not relinquish.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators participated in a pro-Palestinian march in central London, calling for a permanent resolution to the conflict a day after a ceasefire began in Gaza. Organized by the Palestine Coalition, the march proceeded along Victoria Embankment to Whitehall, with protesters carrying Palestinian flags and signs with slogans like "free Palestine." A small group of counter-protesters also gathered nearby, leading to minor scuffles and 14 arrests by the Metropolitan Police. Speakers at the rally described the U.S.-brokered ceasefire as a positive but precarious step, vowing to continue their advocacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market ended the week with a significant downturn after President Trump announced new tariff threats against China, causing the S&P 500 to suffer its worst single-day loss since April. The announcement included an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports and new export controls on critical software, set to begin in November. This development overshadowed a volatile week for tech stocks like Nvidia, which saw its shares fluctuate amid major AI-related deals. The new trade tensions have introduced a fresh wave of uncertainty for investors and the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida-based charter airline Verijet has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and canceled all flights, signaling a move toward complete liquidation rather than restructuring. The airline, which operated a fleet of small jets for short-haul flights in the U.S. and the Caribbean, had accumulated over $38.7 million in liabilities. The company's collapse was hastened by the sudden death of its founder in September and a series of lawsuits from customers and creditors over canceled flights and unpaid debts. The shutdown adds Verijet to a growing list of smaller airlines that have failed to sustain operations in 2025.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have formally backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum. The plan stipulates that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election, it will be considered a mandate to negotiate with the UK government for another vote. The strategy was endorsed at the party conference in Aberdeen, overcoming an amendment that sought to treat the election itself as a de-facto referendum. UK Labour leader Keir Starmer has previously stated he would not approve another referendum if he becomes prime minister.</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, part of Gen Z, are rejecting mass-produced "fast furniture" in favor of secondhand items due to environmental concerns and a desire for unique pieces with history. This trend pushes back against the high-waste model of cheap, disposable decor that often ends up in landfills. Researchers estimate that over 95% of the 51 million tons of furniture consumed globally each year is discarded. By scavenging for and restoring used items, this generation is creating a more sustainable and personal approach to home furnishing, a movement reflected in skyrocketing online searches for secondhand decor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress and the president fail to pass a budget, halting non-essential federal operations due to a lack of approved funding. This leads to the furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees, the closure of national parks and museums, and disruptions to various government services. While essential services like law enforcement and air traffic control continue, they often operate with reduced support staff. The current shutdown, the 21st since 1976, stems from a deadlock over healthcare policy, with Democrats and Republicans unable to agree on funding for programs like the Affordable Care Act.</p>
