          <p>Simon Yates, a British cyclist, delivered an exceptional performance in the Giro d'Italia's penultimate stage, overtaking Isaac del Toro to claim his second Grand Tour title. Yates's Visma-Lease A Bike team strategically positioned Wout van Aert in the breakaway group, enabling Yates to catch him on the descent and build a significant lead over the final 30km. Yates's victory marks him as the third British rider to win the Giro, following Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart. The emotional win came after Yates overcame the challenges of the Colle delle Finestre, where his hopes had previously been dashed in 2018, and he expressed his gratitude towards his team after the race.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned of an imminent threat to Taiwan from China, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. Hegseth characterized China as a hegemonic power seeking to dominate Asia, citing a potential 2027 deadline for China's military to invade Taiwan. In response, China accused the US of being the biggest troublemaker for regional peace, deploying offensive weapons in the South China Sea. Hegseth stressed the importance of a strong shield of deterrence forged with allies to prevent war.</p>

          <p>Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog. The report raises concerns as Iran is now the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material. Israel responded by stating that this report is a clear sign that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program. The IAEA urges Iran to fully cooperate with investigations into uranium traces discovered at undeclared sites.</p>

The surgery, called the "third nostril" approach, involved removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor. After a 20-hour operation, the tumor was successfully removed, and Flores is now cancer-free.</p>

Duckworth suggests that AI can serve as a coach, teaching by example through follow-up questions that clarify how chatbots arrive at their conclusions. She recommends incorporating AI usage into school curricula, emphasizing the importance of knowing what questions to ask.
