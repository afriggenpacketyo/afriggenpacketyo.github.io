          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is slated to face congressional questioning regarding his personal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody. Barr had asserted his review of surveillance footage supported a suicide conclusion, but recent analyses by CBS News identified significant inconsistencies between his description and the publicly released video, prompting new questions. This renewed scrutiny highlights persistent suspicions and conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death and his controversial plea deal. The House Oversight Committee seeks to understand Barr's direct involvement and the thoroughness of the initial investigation, as the case continues to draw intense public and governmental attention, emphasizing the need for clarity on the circumstances.</p>

          <p>An article critiques John Ganz's polemic "Against Polling," which argues that political data is "bullshit" and that Democrats should rely more on history and classics for electoral strategy. The author defends "popularism," a data-driven approach, asserting that Ganz mischaracterizes its premises and offers insufficient evidence for his claims. While acknowledging polling's inherent flaws and the dynamic nature of public opinion, the article contends that empirical methods remain crucial for understanding voter sentiment and political reality. It highlights how dismissing data can insulate progressive intuitions from empirical challenge, potentially leading to biased conclusions about effective political approaches and the balance between principles and expediency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Africa's aviation industry faces intense scrutiny after a series of fatal crashes, including recent military and air ambulance incidents, prompting serious questions about safety standards. Experts attribute these disasters not to aircraft malfunction, but primarily to human error, systemic negligence, an insufficient safety culture, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns exacerbated by climate change. Aviation consultants emphasize the critical importance of pilots adhering to established protocols, such as refusing takeoff when automated systems detect faults, and diligently following maintenance schedules. These incidents expose deeper political and regulatory failings, urging African governments to strengthen safety enforcement and better adapt to growing climate volatility to rebuild eroded public trust.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is employing inflammatory and often ironic social media content, including memes and nostalgic historical imagery, to promote its aggressive immigration policies and redefine American identity. Critics argue these posts, such as World War II-style recruitment posters and a painting depicting white settlers displacing Native Americans, normalize cruelty and may reference extremist material. The White House and DHS defend their approach as "bold leadership" and "unapologetically proud of American history." This strategy aims to generate outrage, control discourse, and silence dissent, while artists have pushed back against unauthorized use of their work.</p>

          <p>Germany's federal government significantly increased welfare spending in 2024, paying out over $20 billion, a nearly 15% year-on-year rise primarily for basic income support for those unable to work. This substantial surge in expenditure comes as the nation grapples with a massive federal budget shortfall, prompting Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil to not rule out tax increases to bridge a projected €30 billion gap. The governing coalition is actively looking into reforming the social security system and expects all ministries to submit savings proposals. This financial challenge coincides with consecutive years of economic contraction in Germany, signaling a period of difficult fiscal decisions.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's blockbuster obesity drug, Wegovy, has received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a serious liver disease. This landmark approval makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class treatment authorized for MASH, significantly expanding its applications beyond diabetes and obesity and deepening its presence in the metabolic disease market. The decision, based on promising trial results demonstrating statistically significant improvement in liver fibrosis, led to an almost 5% surge in Novo Nordisk's shares. This represents a major medical advancement and a significant market expansion for the company.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional redistricting has intensified in the U.S., spurred by President Trump's call for Republican-led states to redraw voting maps to favor GOP candidates. The article explains gerrymandering, including "packing" and "cracking," as methods used to manipulate district lines for political advantage, effectively allowing politicians to choose their voters. Texas Republicans are openly pursuing five more GOP-leaning districts, leading to a Democratic walkout and arrest warrants. In response, California Democrats are rushing their own new map to create advantages, highlighting the deeply partisan nature of this technical process and its significant impact on electoral outcomes and voter representation.</p>

          <p>A 47-year-old Liverpool man has been conditionally bailed following his arrest on suspicion of racially abusing Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo during a Premier League match at Anfield. The incident, which briefly halted the game in the 29th minute after Semenyo flagged it to the referee, led to a prompt police response and the man's apprehension. As part of his bail conditions, the individual is now prohibited from attending any regulated football match in the UK and must remain at least one mile from any designated football stadium. This decisive action by authorities underscores ongoing efforts to address and penalize racist behavior in sports, aiming to foster a more inclusive environment.</p>

Wadephul explicitly criticized China's "increasingly aggressive" behavior in the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China seas, warning that any escalation in this sensitive trade hub would have severe consequences for global security and the world economy. He also accused Beijing of enabling Russia's war in Ukraine through its role as a major supplier of dual-use goods and a key oil and gas customer. This partnership aims to counter threats to the established international order.</p>

          <p>Netflix is removing a large selection of movies and TV shows from its library this month, including the critically acclaimed but brutal 2018 film "The Nightingale." This psychological thriller, known for its graphic portrayal of sexual assault and murder, previously caused cinema walkouts but was defended by its director as non-exploitative. The article also notes the departure of the popular series "Lost," which recently saw a resurgence on the platform and is frequently listed among the best TV shows of all time. Users are often notified only shortly before titles disappear, leading to some consternation, especially regarding Netflix Originals.</p>

          <p>South Korea and the United States have commenced their annual Ulchi Freedom Shield military exercises, involving 21,000 troops, aimed at enhancing readiness against North Korean threats.

The exercises occur ahead of a sensitive summit between South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and U.S. President Donald Trump, where discussions may include changes to the decades-old alliance and U.S. troop payment demands, adding to already heightened regional tensions.</p>

          <p>An article argues that Israel is deliberately targeting journalists in Gaza to suppress critical reporting and undermine the credible image of Palestinians, rather than for genuine security reasons. It highlights the immense bravery and professionalism of Gaza's journalists, who continue their work despite facing threats, assassinations of colleagues, and personal losses. The author criticizes Western media for often treating Israeli claims as plausible without sufficient scrutiny, thereby contributing to an ambiguity that benefits Israel's narrative. This systematic deception, the article asserts, aims to extinguish independent witness accounts from the region, making it easier to prosecute military campaigns unchallenged.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough by successfully transforming human stem cells into dopamine-producing brain cells and transplanting them into mice. This innovative procedure notably reduced depressive behavior and increased feelings of enjoyment in the mice, offering new insights into mood regulation. The development holds immense potential as a future therapy to treat neuropsychiatric disorders, aiming to directly target and repair dysfunctional neural circuits. This study provides crucial proof-of-concept evidence supporting the use of cell therapy to address conditions like major depressive disorder and anhedonia, which is an inability to experience enjoyment from once pleasurable activities.</p>

It details the escalating civilian casualties, which reached a three-year high last month, and the profound impact on daily life in frontline villages and cities. Ukrainians express weariness but strong defiance, deeply distrusting Putin's intentions and fearing that ceding land would only enable further aggression. European leaders are joining Zelenskyy in Washington to counter a US-endorsed "peace plan" that lacks meaningful security guarantees for Ukraine, emphasizing the need for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>A retired accountant expressed profound distress after a six-month struggle to secure her elderly mother's private pension, which pension administrators Aon had inexplicably stopped. The 87-year-old mother, a member of the Windrush generation, relies heavily on the pension, and its cessation caused significant financial hardship and emotional distress. After the BBC intervened, Aon promptly reinstated the payments and provided all the owed money, explaining the delay was due to "legally unacceptable" paperwork and necessary verification issues. The daughter highlighted the frustration of the process and worried that other vulnerable individuals might be experiencing similar bureaucratic difficulties without external help.</p>

The outcome signals a potential reconciliation with the United States after years of alignment with China and Russia, and a move away from the populist, state-directed economic policies of the Movement Toward Socialism party.
