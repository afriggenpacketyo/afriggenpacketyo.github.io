          <h2>Yale Alumni Express Concerns Over Treasury Secretary's Role in Trump Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 20:52:28 EDT</div>

          <p>A group of Yale University alumni penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a fellow graduate, urging him to reconsider his role in the Trump administration. The letter expresses concern that the administration's actions undermine democratic principles and could lead to authoritarianism, citing examples such as alleged attacks on independent media and the seizure of private data. Bessent responded by defending his service to the American people and criticizing the letter's signatories for engaging in keyboard activism rather than participating in the political process. He affirmed his belief in President Trump and his administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small business owners are advocating for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, arguing that these tariffs threaten their financial stability due to thin profit margins. Senator Ed Markey has also urged the Small Business Administration to grant these exemptions, highlighting that larger corporations have already received tariff relief. Small businesses often lack the financial reserves and supply chain diversity of larger companies to absorb these economic shocks. Some owners are already reporting adverse impacts, including potential order cancellations due to increased costs.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has proposed a counteroffer to a White House peace plan, which has been criticized for potentially favoring Russia. The Ukrainian plan outlines security guarantees backed by the U.S. and the use of frozen Russian assets for reconstruction. While the plan avoids explicit concessions regarding territory or NATO membership, it suggests room for negotiation on long-standing points of contention. The Ukrainian President had intended to attend the Pope's funeral, but the Russian attacks on Kyiv have put those plans in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has reversed a Biden-era policy that protected journalists from subpoenas and compelled testimony in leak investigations. Bondi cited the need to prevent federal employees from leaking sensitive information and said the policy allows for subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants to obtain information from journalists, with certain restrictions. The move marks a return to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations, similar to policies used during the Trump and Obama administrations.</p>

The new sequence will consist of three numerals, followed by three letters, and one numeral. An increase in new vehicle registrations, potentially driven by concerns over rising car prices due to trade wars, has accelerated the depletion of the current sequence. The state expects a slight decrease in new vehicle registrations in 2025 due to the fluid nature of trade policy negotiations.</p>
