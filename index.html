        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared the cessation of U.S. sanctions against Syria, aiming to foster stability and peace in the country. This decision marks a shift towards restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria after over a decade of strained ties. Syria has faced severe sanctions since 2004, intensified in 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings, and further complicated by civil war and terrorist activities. The move follows the toppling of the Assad regime in 2024 and aims to support the new transitional government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa and facilitate humanitarian aid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, raising the prospect of their release after over 30 years for the 1989 killings of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation in prison and support from corrections officials as factors in his decision. The brothers expressed remorse for their actions and apologized to their family during the hearing. While the district attorney opposed resentencing, the judge's decision now places their fate in the hands of California's governor and parole board officials, marking a significant turn in a case that has captivated public attention for decades.</p>

          <p>The UK government intends to move 12,000 civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. This initiative includes closing 11 London offices and opening new government campuses in Manchester and Aberdeen, aiming to save £94 million annually by 2032. The government plans to locate 50% of UK-based senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030, with regional campuses focused on digital innovation, AI, and energy. The relocation is expected to bring £729 million to the local economy by 2030, though some critics argue the plan is not serious about reducing the size of the state.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies, including proposed tariffs and rhetoric against renewable energy, are creating uncertainty for the clean energy sector in the U.S. While the Inflation Reduction Act provides incentives for clean energy, Trump's administration has attempted to halt funding for green energy projects. Tariffs on Southeast Asia, a key supplier of solar components, could significantly impact the solar industry. Despite these challenges, experts believe the clean energy sector will continue to grow, but at a slower pace, emphasizing the importance of economic competitiveness and national security.</p>

Potential candidates find it difficult to step into the family office bandwagon, and some family offices can also be particular when it comes to choosing the perfect fit. The talent crunch is also owed to a lack of qualified candidates — it's also selectivity on the part of family offices. (not investment advice)</p>
