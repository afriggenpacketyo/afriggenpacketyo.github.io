          <p>Due to increasing geopolitical tensions between the US and China, wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly shifting their real estate investments to markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. According to Juwai IQI, demand for homes costing over US$5 million from Chinese buyers has decreased in the US, which was the top choice in 2023. Juwai IQI co-founder Kashif Ansari noted that geopolitical friction and increased scrutiny of property deals have discouraged some buyers, leading them to seek friendlier alternatives. Chinese investment in US homes has dropped more than 50 per cent from its peak in 2017.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein analyzes the choice of JD Vance as Donald Trump's vice president, arguing it signals a shift towards a more loyalist and less restrained administration compared to Trump's first term. The selection of Vance, over more moderate candidates, reflects Trump's preference for courtiers who prioritize loyalty and enforcement over independent advice. Klein argues that this choice eliminates internal checks and balances, paving the way for a more reckless and unrestrained presidency. This structure contrasts sharply with Trump's first term, where advisors and established Republicans provided some moderation.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is presenting a significant challenge to Britain's traditional two-party system, gaining ground in local elections and a parliamentary special election. The party's success reflects a growing disenchantment with both the Labour and Conservative parties, as well as a fragmentation of traditional class loyalties among voters. Reform UK's rise, fueled by Farage's vigorous campaigning, has led to increased competition from smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Political scientists suggest that Reform is now well-positioned to potentially replace the Conservatives as the main opposition party.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam is causing widespread concern among factory managers and workers, threatening the country's manufacturing-dependent economy. The potential tariffs have led to job cuts and order cancellations as American retailers grow wary of the increased costs. Vietnam has become increasingly reliant on demand from the United States, which has driven much of its economic growth in recent years. Vietnamese leaders are attempting to negotiate with the Trump administration to avert the tariffs and mitigate the potential damage to the country's economy.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, creating uncertainty about the broadcaster's future. The publicly funded broadcaster has been off air since March due to an executive order that led to the placement of over 1,000 employees on leave.

The survey highlights the impact of Japan's surname law on couples' decisions, as the country is unique in mandating shared surnames upon marriage. While the opposition supports allowing separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, citing concerns about traditional family values. The survey estimates that over a million people in common-law relationships would marry if separate surnames were permitted.</p>
