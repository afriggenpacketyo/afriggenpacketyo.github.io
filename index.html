        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming world swimming championships are set to be defined by a rivalry between Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh and American veteran Katie Ledecky. McIntosh is attempting to win five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has accomplished, while Ledecky aims to secure her seventh world title in the 800m freestyle. Their head-to-head race in that event is highly anticipated, representing a potential generational shift in the sport as McIntosh, who grew up idolizing Ledecky, now poses the most significant challenge to her long-standing dominance.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for global cooperation and consensus-building on the governance of artificial intelligence, highlighting the security risks associated with the technology. Speaking at a conference in Shanghai, Li criticized monopolistic control and advocated for open access, a statement seen as a response to US restrictions on high-end chip exports to China. He also announced a new Chinese-led initiative to promote global AI collaboration, emphasizing the need to balance rapid development with shared security protocols amid the escalating US-China tech race.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team achieved its first win under head coach Sean Lynn with a victory over Australia in Brisbane, providing a significant boost just weeks before the Rugby World Cup. After an early Australian try and a lengthy delay due to a thunderstorm, Wales rallied with two tries from Nel Metcalfe to take the lead. Despite a late first-half score from Australia, Wales extended their lead and held on with strong defense, securing an encouraging win against a higher-ranked opponent.</p>

          <p>A prominent pro-life group is declaring a major victory following Planned Parenthood's announcement that it will close two of its Houston facilities this fall. One of the locations set for closure was described by the group as the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere. Planned Parenthood cited rising operational costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates as reasons for the decision, which comes as the organization faces continued pressure from abortion restrictions enacted in Texas following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>The anticipated recovery of the luxury goods market is being hampered by several key factors, creating a mixed outlook for major brands. A primary headwind is the rebalancing of sales in Japan, where a weak yen had previously fueled a tourist shopping boom that has now subsided. While some firms report strengthening sales in the U.S., there is uncertainty over whether this is sustainable or driven by consumers buying ahead of potential tariffs, which may force brands to implement further price increases.

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on challenges in the U.S. academic and immigration systems to recruit top-tier talent. As American universities face funding cuts and foreign students encounter stricter visa policies, Chinese firms are offering highly competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates and engineers. This influx of brainpower is fueling the rapid expansion and technological advancement of China's quant sector, which is increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to compete in the global financial market.

          <p>Two Democratic members of Congress have formally requested that Jeffrey Epstein's estate provide a complete, unredacted copy of a so-called "birthday book" created for the late sex offender. The book reportedly contains messages from many powerful associates, including a crude entry attributed to Donald Trump, which he has denied making. The lawmakers assert that the book's contents are vital for congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and related matters.</p>

          <h2>Tesla's Planned California Car Service Must Use Human Drivers, Regulator Clarifies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 21:18:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California regulators have clarified that any expansion of Tesla's car service in the state must operate with human drivers, not as a fully autonomous robotaxi service. The clarification came after Tesla notified the Public Utilities Commission of its intent to offer a "friends and family" service in the Bay Area. While CEO Elon Musk has teased a robotaxi future, the commission confirmed that under Tesla's current permits, it is not authorized to transport passengers in autonomous vehicles, with or without payment.</p>
