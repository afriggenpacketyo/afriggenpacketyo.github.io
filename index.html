          <p>Following a deadly attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has taken retaliatory measures against Pakistan, including downgrading diplomatic ties and suspending the Indus Waters Treaty. The treaty, negotiated in 1960, governs water usage from six rivers flowing through both countries and affects millions. India's foreign secretary stated the treaty would remain suspended until Pakistan ceases support for cross-border terrorism. The attack, which killed 26 people, is considered the worst since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, with India alleging Pakistani origins of the attackers. The group Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance proposed a U.S. peace plan for Ukraine that aligns with Russian objectives, including freezing territorial lines, accepting Russia's annexation of Crimea, and prohibiting Ukraine from joining NATO. This marks the first time a U.S. official has publicly outlined a plan so heavily favoring Russia. President Putin has previously stated he would accept a cease-fire if Ukraine withdraws troops from regions Russia claims and abandons its NATO aspirations. Vance's comments appear to pressure President Zelensky to accept Russian occupation of Ukrainian lands.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, streaming numbers for the 2024 Oscar-winning film 'Conclave,' which depicts the process of selecting a new pope, experienced a significant increase.

Luminate, a tracking firm, reported a substantial jump in viewership for 'Conclave,' with a 3,200 percent increase in week-over-week streaming. The increase was attributed to both the Pope's death and Amazon Prime Video making the film available to subscribers at no extra cost.</p>
