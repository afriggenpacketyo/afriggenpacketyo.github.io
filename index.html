          <p>The Trump administration has officially increased tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to 50%, a move that experts predict will raise costs for various consumer goods. Industries such as automobile manufacturing, sports equipment, and canned goods are likely to be affected, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. Economists warn that businesses will likely pass on these tariff-related costs, impacting both industries and consumers. The tariffs, intended to reduce reliance on foreign nations and bolster domestic steelmakers, could also affect the housing sector due to increased building material costs.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University, citing concerns that the institution is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students. The proclamation invokes the Immigration and Nationality Act, prohibiting entry for at least six months. The administration claims Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has extensive entanglements with foreign countries, and has discriminated in its admissions practices. This move follows previous attempts by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program.</p>

The author points to Trump's focus on personal relationships with foreign leaders and his family business's international deals as evidence of this doctrine.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration has launched an unprecedented crusade against legal immigrants, employing cruel and lawless tactics. The author contrasts this with previous administrations, which also regulated undocumented immigration but expanded pathways for legal immigration. The article criticizes Trump's actions, such as banning refugee resettlement and revoking legal status, as aimed at deterring immigration. The author concludes that these policies inflict suffering and are tacitly approved by centrist Democrats.</p>

Willet had been under investigation in Switzerland after being present when an American woman died using a so-called suicide pod. The investigation was focused on the legality and ethical implications of using the suicide pod, which is a device designed to allow individuals to end their lives with minimal discomfort.</p>

          <p>China has approved the mass production of its first home-grown 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100. This development is a significant milestone for China's aviation ambitions, especially in light of US export restrictions on key technologies. While the AES100 differs from jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts consider it a major step forward for the country's aviation sector. The development reflects China's growing ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines.</p>
