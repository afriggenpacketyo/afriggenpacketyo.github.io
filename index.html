          <p>US President Donald Trump announced that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, a claim Israel has not yet confirmed. Trump, scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, expressed his belief that Netanyahu wants to end hostilities and hopes Hamas accepts the deal. This announcement follows increased military action in northern Gaza and an Israeli airstrike that killed 20 Palestinians. The conflict, initiated by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, continues with ongoing efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release, as Israel seeks Hamas's dismantling and Hamas calls for a permanent truce.</p>

          <p>UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer faced significant humiliation and a loss of control in the Commons following a chaotic welfare reform vote. Despite holding a majority, swathes of his own MPs rebelled, forcing a last-minute U-turn on changes to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) eligibility criteria. This episode has left Starmer's plans appearing threadbare and weakened his leadership, leading to questions about potential autumn tax rises and the future of senior cabinet figures. The internal dissent highlights deep anxieties within the government and calls for Starmer to quickly reassert control.</p>

          <p>Paramount has settled President Trump's $10 billion lawsuit over a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million. The settlement allocates funds to Trump's future presidential library and legal fees, with no direct payment to Trump or an apology from Paramount. Paramount also agreed to release transcripts of future presidential candidate interviews. The lawsuit, widely seen as an attack on the First Amendment, challenged the editing of Harris's interview, and its resolution comes after the departures of key CBS News executives.

His journey from a family home near a tennis center to American college tennis, a popular route for British players, highlights his dedication.

Republicans, however, defend it as targeted relief for middle and working-class Americans.

          <p>The G7's recent agreement to exempt American companies from global minimum tax rules, under pressure from President Trump and corporate lobbying, is criticized as prioritizing multinational profits over public interest. This decision undermines Pillar Two of the OECD/G20 framework, which aimed for a 15% minimum corporate tax to curb tax competition. Critics argue it incentivizes companies to move headquarters to the US, perpetuating tax avoidance and deepening global inequality. The article calls for a stronger, more inclusive international tax system, potentially under UN leadership, to ensure corporations pay their fair share. (not investment advice)</p>
