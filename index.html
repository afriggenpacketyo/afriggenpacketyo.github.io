          <p>The Trump administration is seeking an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to block a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case brought by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) against the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). CREW is requesting access to DOGE's records and plans for government overhaul, but the administration claims executive privilege, arguing that DOGE, as a presidential advisory board, is not subject to FOIA. A federal court is scheduled to proceed with depositions and document production to determine FOIA's applicability, which the Solicitor General argues would expose private executive branch information. </p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with House Republican leaders and members of the House Freedom Caucus at the White House to address the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which advances his legislative agenda. The meeting is crucial as GOP leaders are struggling to get the bill back on track after negotiations with hard-liners faltered. The bill, which includes changes to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, SNAP food assistance, and immigration policy, faces opposition from Republican hard-liners primarily over Medicaid work requirements and a cap on state and local tax deductions. Democrats have introduced an amendment to strike provisions that they say would cause millions of Americans to lose healthcare and food assistance.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 2% at $108,955.10, according to Coin Metrics. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion last week, with only two days of outflows in May.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed a surprise bill proposing a tax break on tip income, a concept supported by both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. The bill, if enacted, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, provided the tips are reported. While this could benefit moderate to middle-income workers substantially, it offers no marginal benefit to the lowest income tipped workers, who already don't pay federal income tax due to their earnings falling under the standard deduction. Concerns have been raised about potential issues such as the introduction of tips in new occupations or misclassification of income as tips to exploit the tax benefit.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) debt can be sold to debt collectors if unpaid, potentially harming credit scores. While each BNPL company has its own policies, many will attempt to collect the debt in-house before outsourcing or selling it to a third-party agency. Consumers should verify the debt, understand their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), and negotiate a settlement or payment plan.

Critics argue that reinstating Rose weakens the message against gambling, especially given the increasing integration of gambling into professional sports. Rose violated baseball's most sacrosanct rule by gambling on the game and repeatedly lied about it.</p>

Vaccine makers may need to fund newer, lengthy placebo-controlled trials for younger, healthy people to gain access to future shots.

The operation, known as Operation East, involved painstaking police work and intelligence sharing with Western security services.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz does not see any indication that the war in Ukraine will end soon, while Defense Minister Boris Pistorius urged further action to cut off Russia's financial lifelines. Merz referred to the potential mediation of the Pope as "the last earthly authority" and emphasized the importance of Germany playing an "active, supportive, strong" role in the peace efforts. Pistorius said Trump misjudged his influence on Putin and urged further action to cut off Russia's financial lifelines.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government stated that South Sudan is not the final destination for a deportation flight, despite a judge's order requiring migrants to be allowed to challenge their removal to third countries. The agency said it was seeking to deport eight "uniquely barbaric monsters" who had all been convicted of crimes including murder, sexual assault and kidnapping. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons said: "If we don't have a country that'll take their citizens back, we do have an option to find a safe third country."</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia has died at the age of 75 after a battle with esophageal cancer, his family said Wednesday. Connolly served as the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform until late last month, when he said he would step down because his cancer had returned. First elected to Congress in 2008, Connolly was known in the House for his fierce advocacy on behalf of the thousands of federal employees who live in his northern Virginia district.</p>

          <p>Narendra Modi's new counterterrorism doctrine, involving military responses to attacks from Pakistan, carries international and domestic risks. Exchanges of fire between India and Pakistan intensified, but a cease-fire was brokered by President Trump, undermining Modi's image of strength. This has led to criticism from his nationalist base and strained relations with neighboring countries. India's national security is increasingly tied to Modi's personality cult, potentially leading to military adventurism and regional instability.</p>

The memorandum also establishes the protection of archaeological sites involved in the search efforts. Roughly 72,000 American servicemembers remain unaccounted for from the war around the world, according to DPAA.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S), a major British retailer, announced that a "highly sophisticated" cyberattack that crippled operations over the last month is expected to cause disruption until July and cost the company about 300 million pounds ($400 million) in lost profits this year. The breach, which began over Easter weekend, forced the company to pause online orders, resort to manual processes, and deal with food waste. While some processes are recovering, full online order restoration is not expected until July. The retailer said the attack was caused by human error and social engineering tricks via a third-party supplier.</p>

Some of the targets were internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian borders which monitored aid shipments going into the country.

          <p>A surprise inflation increase suggests a potentially gloomier economic outlook, with prices rising faster than in France or Germany. While pay rises are still outpacing inflation for many workers, the rise in gas and electricity bills, driven by higher wholesale global costs, will take time to reverse. Economists worry that rising service costs suggest bosses are passing on wage cost increases, potentially inching inflation up further over the next few months, although they think it will remain below 4%. The government's own policies risk adding to inflation.</p>

          <p>George Wendt, best known for his role as Norm Peterson on the sitcom “Cheers,” died on Tuesday at his home in Studio City, Calif. He was 76. Over more than four decades, Mr. Wendt racked up about 170 film and television credits. But he was best known for “Cheers.” He appeared in every episode of the sitcom during its 11-year run on NBC, beginning in 1982. On the surface, there was nothing remarkable about the Norm character, except perhaps for his general indolence and taste for suds. But as a regular guy among regular guys, he was highly relatable to countless fans of the show.</p>
