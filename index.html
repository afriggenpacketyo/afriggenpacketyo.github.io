        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is rolling out Microsoft's Copilot AI, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, for 30,000 city government workers, including nurses and social workers. Mayor Daniel Lurie announced the initiative aims to improve city services by speeding up administrative tasks like data analysis and report drafting, thereby freeing up employee time. A successful six-month pilot program involving 2,000 workers demonstrated productivity gains of up to five hours per week. The city will leverage its existing Microsoft license, incurring no additional costs for this large-scale AI adoption.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 18:00:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, proposing that it could be mutually owned by its postmasters. This move follows the major Horizon IT scandal, where faulty software led to hundreds of wrongful convictions of sub-postmasters. The government aims to rebuild trust and transform the organization's culture, with potential models including a joint venture or a charter system similar to the BBC. Any significant structural change is not expected until at least 2030, pending the replacement of the Horizon system and inquiry recommendations.</p>

          <p>Recent global university rankings show a significant rise for Chinese institutions, with Tsinghua University now positioned just outside the top 10. According to the Best Global Universities list by U.S. News and World Report, Peking University and Zhejiang University have also climbed to 25th and 45th, respectively. This upward trend, which has seen 15 Chinese universities enter the top 100, is attributed to decades of sustained government investment in education, research, and recruitment of overseas talent. The rankings highlight a shift in the global academic landscape, often framed as a 'brain gain' for China.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with firing more than half of the Department of Education's employees, a move described by officials as a step toward its total shutdown. This decision, made on the court's 'shadow docket,' temporarily lifts a lower court's injunction while the case is pending. Critics, including the dissenting justices, argue this action effectively allows the executive branch to dismantle federal programs mandated by Congress, raising constitutional concerns about the separation of powers. The ruling suggests the court may permit the president to achieve through firings what is constitutionally forbidden through direct defunding.</p>

          <p>Tesla is defending its Autopilot system in a Miami federal court in a wrongful death lawsuit following a 2019 crash in Florida. The incident occurred when a Model S, with Autopilot engaged, struck a parked truck, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs allege that design defects in the Autopilot system failed to detect the obstacle, making Tesla partially responsible for the tragedy. Tesla counters that the crash was caused by a distracted driver who was looking for his phone and had overridden the car's systems at the time of impact.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes from Mexico after trade negotiations failed to produce an agreement. Proponents claim the tax will support the U.S. tomato industry, while opponents, including U.S. companies growing in Mexico, warn it will raise consumer prices. This decision aligns with President Trump's broader tariff policies and follows the withdrawal from the 2019 Tomato Suspension Agreement, which aimed to prevent Mexico from selling tomatoes at unfairly low prices. Mexico currently supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market, a significant increase over the past two decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has launched an independent campaign for mayor of New York City, setting up a general election contest against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. After a distant second-place finish in the Democratic primary, Cuomo is re-entering the race and has pledged to drop out in September if another candidate appears better positioned to defeat Mamdani. This unusual proposal is part of a strategy to consolidate the non-Mamdani vote in the heavily Democratic city. Cuomo's campaign begins as he trails the frontrunner in recent polls.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents, with another critically injured. The blaze broke out Sunday night, prompting a massive response from firefighters and police who rescued numerous individuals from the building. Officials have described the event as an "unfathomable tragedy" and are investigating the cause, which does not currently appear suspicious. The incident has also raised concerns from the local firefighters' union about inadequate staffing levels, which they claim may have hindered rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino is reportedly considering quitting his post after a heated confrontation with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Bongino, a former right-wing podcaster and an unconventional choice for the role, has been a vocal proponent of Epstein-related conspiracy theories. The recent Justice Department memo concluding Epstein's death was a suicide and that no client list exists has caused a rift within the MAGA movement. Bongino's potential departure highlights the deep divisions and public squabbling among Trump's supporters over the controversial case.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. These smoke-free products, such as the popular brand Zyn, contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to children. Researchers analyzed calls to U.S. poison centers and found that while pouch ingestions are a small fraction of all nicotine cases, they are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes.

The administration defends the aggressive tariff strategy as a tool to ensure fair trade, boost domestic industries, and achieve other foreign policy goals. However, with few comprehensive trade deals secured, critics argue the approach creates instability for both businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent deadly flash floods in Texas are highlighting critical gaps in the nation's flood maps, which often fail to account for risks from intense rainfall. FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps primarily focus on river and coastal flooding, largely excluding flash flood dangers along smaller waterways, leaving many homeowners unprepared and uninsured. Experts argue the maps are often outdated due to a slow, politically influenced updating process and an overreliance on historical data. This can lead to underestimated risks and vulnerable construction in areas facing growing threats from climate change-driven extreme weather.</p>
