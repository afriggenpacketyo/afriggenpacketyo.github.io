        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's efforts to persuade House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill fell short during a visit to Capitol Hill. The "SALT Caucus" opposes the bill because they believe it doesn't adequately boost state and local tax deductions for their constituents. A 2017 Republican tax bill capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, seen as a political move against Democratic-leaning states. The current bill proposes raising the deduction to $30,000, which is still insufficient for some GOP lawmakers from these states, threatening the bill's passage before Memorial Day weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump cautioned House Republicans against tampering with Medicaid while urging them to pass a tax bill. His warning came during a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill. The movement on the tax bill is stalled by a group of Republicans who want cuts to Medicaid and the addition of work requirements for eligibility. Critics argue that work requirements would create a bureaucratic nightmare, potentially impacting nearly 80 million Americans covered by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p>

The book claims that Joe and Beau Biden falsely touted Beau's 'clean bill of health' despite knowing about his glioblastoma diagnosis. Beau Biden collapsed during a family vacation in 2013 and underwent brain surgery, but the public was told a 'small lesion' was removed, when it was actually a 'tumor slightly larger than a golf ball.'</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver has been charged with felony assault for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a protest outside a Newark ICE detention center.

McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and mischaracterize the events, stating that ICE agents escalated the situation. The U.S. Attorney's Office announced the charges on social media before they were formally filed, breaking Justice Department precedent.</p>

          <p>New research highlights the life-saving impact of Medicaid, particularly for low-income adults and those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act saved 27,400 lives between 2010 and 2022. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that loss of Medicaid coverage, which includes a prescription drug subsidy, led to decreased prescription fills and increased mortality. These findings underscore the potential deadly effects of proposed Medicaid cuts and increased eligibility checks.</p>

          <p>CNN's Jake Tapper, in his new book 'Original Sin,' co-authored with Axios' Alex Thompson, describes a decline in Joe Biden's mental acuity during his presidency. The book alleges that Biden failed to recognize political allies, lost his train of thought, and forgot important dates. Tapper says one source described the presidency as being run by a five-person board with Biden as chairman. The book also touches on Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis and the White House's response to critical coverage of his decline.</p>

Parcels sent directly to warehouses will face a lower fee of 50 cents.
