          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, who was deported to Honduras with her mother, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney stated that they are taking time to consider their options, the safety of their children, and how to address the harms they have suffered. A federal judge had previously expressed suspicion that the Trump administration deported the child without due process. The Justice Department argued it was in the child's best interest to remain in her mother's custody, denying any risk of irreparable harm.</p>

          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, daughter of actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was arrested at Columbia University during protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Sarsgaard received a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing after student activists occupied part of the Butler library.

The protests are part of a broader wave of student-led anti-war demonstrations amid crackdowns on free speech.</p>
