          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident where a Mexican navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge. Investigators are awaiting permission from the Mexican government to access the ship, which is currently docked at Pier 36. The NTSB will examine the ship's engines, crew interviews, and electronic data to determine the cause of the acceleration leading to the crash. The incident resulted in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to several others, prompting public mourning and calls for answers from the victims' families. The Brooklyn Bridge has been deemed structurally safe following the incident.</p>

The deal will bring new seasons and a library of previous episodes to Netflix's subscribers, while also maintaining the show's presence on PBS. This move follows a trend of Netflix increasing its focus on children's content, with the platform also adding new episodes of Peppa Pig and interactive games.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge in their Hong Kong trading debut, rising as much as 14%.

CATL plans to allocate 90% of the funds raised to construct a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. While facing challenges such as trade tensions and scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Defense, CATL's global expansion reflects the growing demand for EV batteries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China attracted a substantial net capital inflow into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war challenges initiated by the U.S. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and the recent downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by Moody's. Analysts suggest that this shift indicates changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange in China reported a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion in April from both individuals and companies.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, in an effort to stimulate its economy. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move comes as state-backed commercial lenders reduced their deposit rates to protect their net interest margin. The rate cuts are part of a broader package of stimulus measures announced by Beijing, including reductions to the lending rates and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserves.

Marine scientist Greg Asner notes that the decline is more severe in other locations like the Great Barrier Reef and the Caribbean. Efforts are underway to educate tourists on using reef-safe sunscreens and to implement underwater nurseries for coral regrowth, but the long-term recovery depends on controlling fossil fuels.</p>
