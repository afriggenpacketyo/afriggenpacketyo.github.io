          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. cease-fire proposal for Gaza, presenting mediators with their response that includes demands for changes to the agreement. Officials indicate that Hamas is seeking guarantees to end the war, which has been a primary point of contention with Israel. The latest proposal, submitted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, aims for a 60-day cease-fire, but Hamas is seeking a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to hostilities, as well as a guarantee for continuous humanitarian aid. Hamas also proposed a hostage exchange, offering to release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. </p>

          <p>A teenager and two adults in their 40s were killed in a single-vehicle crash on the M5 in South Gloucestershire, prompting a temporary closure of the road.

          <p>Millions of bees escaped after a truck hauling approximately 70,000 pounds of active honey bee hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, near the Canadian border.

The Whatcom County Sheriff's Office stated that the goal is to save as many bees as possible, and the site of the crash will remain closed until the rescue operation is complete.

          <p>A significant number of obese patients in England and Wales are being denied hip and knee replacements by the NHS based on their Body Mass Index (BMI), sparking controversy and criticism. This practice, which affects one-third of NHS areas in England and multiple health boards in Wales, contradicts guidance from the National Institute for Care Excellence (Nice). Patients are being told to lose weight before becoming eligible for surgery, but waiting lists for NHS weight loss programs are extensive, with some individuals facing delays of up to three years. The Royal College of Surgeons has criticized the policy, asserting that denying patients care could compromise their mobility and overall health. </p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has launched a federal effort to investigate environmental toxins as a cause of rising autism rates, despite the scientific community's emphasis on genetics. Kennedy has declared autism an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù and plans to examine chemicals, molds, vaccines, and ultrasounds as potential culprits. However, many autism scientists believe that the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and improved screening methods. They argue that genetics play a significant role in autism's development, citing the identification of hundreds of genes associated with the condition. </p>

          <p>Milwaukee is currently dealing with a lead poisoning crisis that has led to the temporary closure of several schools and prompted extensive inspections. The crisis began when a child tested positive for high lead levels, and the source was traced back to the school due to chipped lead paint and lead-laden dust. The city is now inspecting all public schools built before 1978, but federal support from the CDC was denied due to restructuring within the Department of Health and Human Services. The city has been left to manage the crisis independently, facing challenges in identifying the sources of exposure and lacking the expertise to interpret lead dust levels effectively. </p>

The U.S. State Department has been revoking visas of musicians playing "narco-corridos," a genre that sometimes glorifies cartel leaders. Grupo Firme stated that their visas and those of their team are under administrative review by the U.S. Embassy, making it impossible to perform at La Onda Fest. This action follows sanctions against other musical groups for projecting images of cartel leaders at concerts, highlighting the U.S. government's stance against music that promotes criminal activity. </p>

          <p>Crowds of civilians in Gaza have been rushing aid trucks, according to the World Food Programme (WFP), reflecting the dire hunger and desperation in the region. The WFP reported that 77 trucks loaded with flour were stopped and looted, with food taken primarily by people trying to feed their families. The humanitarian organization said that the incidents are due to a very high chance that convoys would not reach their warehouse, a decision was taken to let people take aid in the event of crowds. A UN-backed assessment indicates that Gaza's entire population is at "critical risk" of famine, with two million people in desperate need of food, but the amount sent in the last week amounts to just over 10% of people's needs.</p>

          <p>UK steelmakers have criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to double import taxes on steel and aluminum to 50%, describing it as "yet another body blow" to the industry. Trade group UK Steel warned that some orders could be delayed or canceled, creating uncertainty for shipments already en route across the Atlantic. The new 50% import tax is set to take effect on Wednesday, replacing the 25% tariff announced earlier this year. A UK government spokesperson said they are engaging with the U.S. to provide clarity to the industry, as the finalized trade deal between the UK and US has not yet been implemented. </p>

          <p>The stock market experienced volatility this week, influenced by tariff announcements, Nvidia's earnings, and inflation data. President Trump's accusations against China regarding the trade agreement and plans to broaden restrictions on Chinese tech companies initially caused market declines. However, positive earnings reports from Nvidia and Costco provided some support, while Salesforce faced challenges. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, suggesting easing price pressures, though concerns remain about potential tariff-related inflation.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stated that the vaccine is not recommended for these groups, leaving decisions to be made through shared clinical decision-making between healthcare providers and patients or parents. The decision has sparked criticism from leading medical organizations, who argue that there is no new evidence to support the change and that the COVID-19 vaccine remains safe and effective during pregnancy.

The psychiatrist suggests that by focusing on these core principles, parents can reduce anxiety and create a supportive environment for their children's growth.
