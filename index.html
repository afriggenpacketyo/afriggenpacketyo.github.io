          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, asserting that they targeted the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program, leading to a state of emergency in Israel and a counter-attack by Iran. Iranian state media reported the death of Hossein Salami, chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards, and nuclear scientists, while the US denied involvement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation, named Operation Rising Lion, aimed to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat, citing Iran's advancements in uranium enrichment. Iran responded by launching drones towards Israel, and international reactions included concern from Australia, emphasizing the risk of further destabilization in the region. The global nuclear watchdog IAEA confirmed the Natanz facility was hit and is assessing radiation levels.</p>

          <p>For the fourth consecutive night, Northern Ireland experienced unrest, with Portadown seeing masonry thrown at police, although at a lower level than previous days. The violence, which began in Ballymena, has resulted in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests, sparked by a protest over an alleged sexual assault. Police issued warnings and maintained a heavy presence in Portadown, while Ballymena remained relatively quiet after previous nights of rioting. PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher condemned the violence as "racist thuggery" targeting ethnic minorities, stating that families hid in attics and wardrobes during the unrest, and extra police officers were deployed to affected areas, with support from Police Scotland.</p>

          <p>Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya condemned Israel's attack on Iran, labeling it an "escalating situation," and pledged diplomatic efforts to prevent further deterioration. Ryosei Akazawa, Tokyo's top negotiator, expressed hope that Japan would receive special treatment regarding tariffs after striking a deal with the United States, following President Trump's hint at raising auto import levies. Akazawa is visiting Washington for tariff negotiations ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump, with Japan seeking concessions on auto tariffs and the removal of additional sector-based tariffs. Trump is seeking to reduce the trade deficit with Japan. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has encouraged the use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters redirect their sales to the domestic market. Domestic L/Cs, similar to international ones, serve as a guarantee of payment security and enhance credit for Chinese firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic L/Cs can be used for both physical goods and services, with a payment period generally set at one year, providing a financial tool for businesses adjusting to trade war dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) in Germany is calling for the EU to implement trade barriers to protect against China's "unfair state subsidies" that bolster Chinese competitors. Representing medium-sized manufacturers, the VDMA's position marks a shift from previously lauding the Sino-German economic relationship. The group wants countervailing duties imposed on imports from third countries violating EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a specific focus on China's export policies. Bertram Kawlath, VDMAâ€™s president, stated that Chinese companies are heavily subsidized and sometimes disregard technical regulations, calling for government intervention to ensure fair competition.</p>

          <p>Israel launched attacks on Iran, targeting nuclear fuel facilities, bomb assembly sites, and missile production locations, claiming that Iran was close to assembling nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel would continue attacking until the Iranian nuclear program is eliminated, and Israel claimed to have assassinated key nuclear and military personnel inside Iran. Israel's actions were driven by a perceived loss of deterrence after its success in piercing Iran's immunity through repeated attacks on Iranian soldiers and proxies, which diminished Iran's ability to bargain or threaten, leading it to potentially seek nuclear statehood to recover lost influence.</p>

Experts suggest that India could deepen collaboration with the U.S. on critical minerals to enhance future economic competitiveness.

Brown, who last played in the NFL in 2021, has not responded publicly to the charge, which requires a $10,000 bond and house arrest if taken into custody.

Reade pointed out that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. He emphasized that these digital assets do not pose any risks or comparison to gold, wishing proponents would stop marketing them as "gold 2.0." His comments come as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies continues to grow, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices amid heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening US dollar.

Amid these events, Representative Madeleine Dean sought a civil conversation with Speaker Johnson, emphasizing the need for President Trump to de-escalate the situation, and lawmakers express concern about declining trust and the potential for similar incidents affecting them.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has delayed a lower court's order that would have blocked the Trump administration from continuing to deploy the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay and set a hearing for June 17, allowing the deployment to continue temporarily. The initial order, issued by a federal judge in California, would have returned control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, citing that Trump's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, but the appeals court's decision puts that on hold.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's recent broad attack on Iran is characterized as a preventive war, aimed at removing the source of a perceived threat on its own terms, rather than a preemptive strike to thwart an imminent attack. The decision carries moral and practical risks, as preventive actions have historically been viewed as illegal and immoral, unlike preemptive strikes that are considered self-defense. Israel's actions are based on the judgment that Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk, justifying the use of force to eliminate the threat before it becomes too dangerous. However, the scope of the offensive suggests a broader goal of regime change, which raises questions about the justification for the intervention.</p>
