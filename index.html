          <h2>Singapore's Inflation Rate Drops to 0.6% in July, Lowest Since Early 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:25:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate unexpectedly eased to 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021 and falling below economists' forecasts. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, driven by reduced prices in retail, other goods, electricity, and gas. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipates continued moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price hikes. Domestically, slower nominal wage growth and productivity increases are expected to contribute to a moderation in unit labor costs. This trend supports the central bank's earlier policy easing measures implemented this year to address weaker economic growth projections amidst a challenging global trade environment, which has placed Singapore's economy on a path of slower growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A limited number of National Guard members in Washington D.C., likely fewer than 50, have begun carrying their service weapons, following a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This decision escalates President Trump's intervention into the capital's policing, despite previous Pentagon and Army statements that troops would not carry weapons. The Joint Task Force-DC stated that force would only be used as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm. This development occurs as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city as part of a crackdown on crime, which local officials dispute as being on the upswing, citing declining violent crime rates for the past year and a half.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the "Great Resignation" during the pandemic, labor markets in the U.S. and U.K. are now experiencing a "Great Stay" phenomenon, characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze by employers. Economists note a significant decrease in turnover, with workers staying put in roles, even in sectors traditionally seeing high mobility like IT. Firms are hesitant to hire due to economic uncertainty, though layoffs remain historically low as companies are reluctant to lose staff they worked hard to regain. This trend reflects a cooling jobs market, potentially influencing central bank interest rate decisions.</p>

This move follows a State Council directive for restructuring major state-owned carmakers to enhance competitiveness. Despite a challenging industry landscape and a nearly 15% drop in total vehicle deliveries, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed 33%, with the VOYAH series seeing an 84.8% increase.</p>

          <p>The A9, Scotland's longest road, has been the site of 48 fatalities over the past decade, with a recent crash claiming three American lives on a dream trip, highlighting its grim history. The road's design, which frequently switches between single and dual carriageway, is cited as a major factor, leading to dangerous overtaking maneuvers and right turns across traffic. The Scottish government's commitment to dual the entire 113-mile stretch between Inverness and Perth has been delayed by a decade to 2035, drawing criticism from campaigners like the A9 Dual Action Group. Victims' families share their profound grief and call for urgent action to improve safety on the notorious route, emphasizing the lasting impact of these preventable tragedies.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, currently leading in national opinion polls, is urging energy firms to prepare for a return to fracking if the party forms the next government. Deputy leader Richard Tice views the potential shale gas reserves as "energy treasure" that is financially negligent to leave untapped. Despite multiple bans since 2011 due to earthquake and environmental concerns, Reform UK plans to immediately lift any ban and conduct independent test wells. Critics, including former energy minister Charles Hendry, remain skeptical, citing past failures, high costs, and significant public opposition, suggesting the party's ambition may face similar hurdles.</p>

Immigration has become a significant political flashpoint, with escalating tensions over housing tens of thousands of asylum-seekers at public expense. The government announced plans to speed up asylum appeals and clear case backlogs, but the issue remains deeply divisive, with concerns about potential violence amid calls from politicians for more legal challenges against asylum hotels.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged as much as 14.84% on Monday, extending a seven-session rally, with its U.S.-listed shares also climbing significantly. This strong performance follows the company's unveiling of its latest ES8 SUV, priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, making it one of Nio's most affordable models compared to its premium offerings. The subscription plan lowers upfront costs and allows battery swaps or upgrades, with deliveries for the new ES8 set to begin in late September. Nio, traditionally targeting the high-end market, is now launching cheaper brands like Onvo and Firefly to capture a broader customer base in China's intensifying EV sector.</p>

One major focus is the report that the Trump administration is preventing Ukraine from using long-range US-made missiles against Russia, aiming to bring Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, though Ukrainian President Zelensky played down the restrictions. Other headlines include news of a "bombshell" memoir by the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault, and a poll indicating public concern over Sir Keir Starmer's handling of asylum seekers.

          <p>China's plan to build the world's largest hydropower dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet has triggered fears in India of a potential "water war." An Indian government analysis suggests the Chinese dam could reduce water flows by up to 85% during the dry season, impacting over 100 million people downstream. In response, India is fast-tracking plans for its own Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam to mitigate these effects and prevent China from weaponizing water. Beijing asserts its projects are safe and will not adversely impact downstream nations, but the issue remains a significant point of geopolitical tension and environmental concern between the two rivals.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump publicly threatened to investigate former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie after Christie criticized him on ABC’s "This Week." Trump, using his Truth Social platform, accused Christie of lying about the "Bridgegate" scandal during his governorship and suggested reopening the case, stating, "NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!" This threat follows a recent FBI raid on another Trump critic, John Bolton, and aligns with Trump's campaign promises to use the Justice Department for political retribution. Christie had expressed skepticism about Ghislaine Maxwell's statements regarding Trump and criticized the former president's handling of classified information, intensifying the political animosity and raising concerns about the weaponization of legal processes.</p>

          <p>Hopes are fading for Natalia Nagovitsyna, an experienced mountaineer who has been stranded for 12 days on Jengish Chokusu, Kyrgyzstan’s highest mountain, after breaking her leg during a descent. Repeated rescue efforts have been terminated due to extreme weather conditions, which also tragically claimed the life of Italian mountaineer Luca Sinigaglia, who was attempting to save her. Nagovitsyna was last spotted alive by a surveillance drone on August 19, but heavy snowfall has since suspended the search. The mountain, known for its extraordinarily cold and harsh conditions as one of the world's northernmost peaks over 7,000 meters, makes rescue operations exceptionally difficult and perilous, leading to a grim outlook.</p>

The declaration aims to fast-track interventions like expanding prenatal services, creating regional obstetric care, and strengthening community health programs.

          <p>Jim Cramer outlines his "Monday playbook" following a significant stock market rally, driven by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals on interest rate cuts. He attributes the Fed's shift to a dramatic deceleration in hiring, which outweighed concerns about tariffs. Cramer notes that the market's previous downward trend was a miscalculation by "too-smart-for-school hedge funds" who underestimated Powell's commitment to data. He advises focusing on housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs as bullish narratives, while cautioning against enterprise software and certain auto/pharma stocks. Cramer also discusses the Intel saga and the president's influence on the market, predicting continued volatility but overall market strength. (not investment advice)</p>

Founded by Hui Ka Yan, who was once Asia's richest person, Evergrande's troubles began after new government rules restricted developer borrowing. The crisis has severely impacted China's economy, as the real estate sector accounted for about a third of the country's GDP and was a major source of local government revenue. It has also hit ordinary Chinese families who invested savings in property, leading to reduced consumer spending and massive layoffs across allied industries.
