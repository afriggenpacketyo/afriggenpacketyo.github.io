          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been convicted of attempting to murder Graeme Perks, a fellow surgeon, motivated by disciplinary proceedings against him. Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, stabbing him and dousing the house with petrol. The court heard that Perks only survived due to quick action and surgical skill, while Brooks was absent from the trial due to a hunger strike. Brooks now faces sentencing on multiple charges, including attempted murder and arson.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to conduct a new review of Nippon Steel's proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel, a deal previously blocked by President Biden due to national security concerns. Trump's order gives CFIUS 45 days to assess whether measures suggested by U.S. Steel and Nippon sufficiently mitigate any national security risks. The initial blocking of the $14.9 billion deal stemmed from fears of foreign control over a major U.S. steel producer. U.S. Steel shares rose 11% following the announcement.

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, driven by concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. West Texas Intermediate crude futures hit a session low of $58.95 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent also experienced a significant drop. The price decline is attributed to fears that tariffs will increase business costs, leading to reduced economic activity and lower oil demand.

          <p>Amid market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariff announcements, experts addressed questions about the impact on stocks and pensions. Stock market indices reflect the value of major companies, with changes indicating market sentiment. Market downturns can affect pensions, particularly defined contribution plans, but pension investing is a long-term strategy. Tariffs are unpopular in the US and could lead to higher consumer prices and economic downturn. The situation is seen by some as an economic proxy war with China, but American corporations also bear responsibility for shifting production overseas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concern that President Trump's tariffs will lead to a recession, with 69% expecting an economic downturn, many predicting it will hit this year. Over one-third of CEOs expect to cut jobs, and nearly all anticipate price hikes. CEOs expressed frustration and anger, with one describing the tariffs as "disappointingly stupid and illogical." Concerns include potential boycotts of American brands and the impact on global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The former top vaccine regulator at the FDA, Dr. Peter Marks, claims he was forced to resign after refusing Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team unrestricted access to a vaccine safety database. Marks feared the data might be manipulated or deleted. He had attempted to address Kennedy's concerns by developing a "vaccine transparency action plan," but would not allow direct editing of the data. Marks attributed a recent measles-related death to tepid responses from the HHS, which he says is minimizing the use of vaccines.</p>
