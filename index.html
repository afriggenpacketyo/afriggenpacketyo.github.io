          <p>Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, saw its Hong Kong shares jump following positive earnings reports and revenue forecasts. Analysts predict the company will achieve profitability by the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by strong sales and new model releases. Xpeng's first-quarter revenue more than doubled year-over-year, fueled by robust vehicle deliveries, which led to a reduced net loss and improved gross margin.

          <p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans has agreed to a nearly $180 million settlement for victims of clergy sexual assault, marking the latest in a series of settlements by the Catholic Church. The settlement, which involves the archdiocese, its parishes, and several insurers, aims to compensate over 500 individuals who allege they were abused by clergy members. Some survivors and their lawyers, however, have voiced opposition to the proposed settlement, calling it a "secret backroom deal." Despite the opposition, the agreement includes provisions to safeguard against future abuse and provide services to survivors.</p>

          <p>Russia's war-focused economy is showing signs of strain due to international sanctions, inflation, and high production costs, which could eventually compel Moscow to negotiate with Ukraine. While Russia aims to intensify offensive operations to gain leverage, its military equipment stockpiles are dwindling, and further mobilizations would pose political and economic challenges. Russia's central bank is maintaining high interest rates to combat inflation, but a marked slowdown in GDP growth suggests a potential recession. Lower oil prices and tighter sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet" are also impacting revenue, increasing pressure on the country's economy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom faces increasing fragmentation due to economic divisions and declining public confidence in the government, requiring Keir Starmer to address these challenges.

The council's success depends on overcoming tensions between different parts of the UK's devolved system and promoting collaboration to achieve shared priorities.

          <p>A landmark review in the UK proposes releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual offenses and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review recommends managing more offenders in the community and suggests short custodial sentences be reserved for exceptional circumstances. The review also calls for greater flexibility in imposing fines, travel bans, and increased funding for probation services. While the government is expected to accept some measures, concerns have been raised about the strain on the already stretched probation system and the potential impact on public safety.</p>

          <p>Richard Poplak's New York Times guest essay discusses the Trump administration's decision to offer refugee status to white Afrikaners from South Africa, claiming they face discrimination and violence. The article argues that this claim is based on misinformation and a misunderstanding of South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy. While South Africa faces issues of inequality and violence, the author contends that white Afrikaners still benefit from apartheid's economic legacy and that there is no evidence of systematic persecution. The essay critiques the exploitation of these claims by right-wing media and politicians to promote a false narrative of white victimhood.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke California's vehicle emissions waivers, a decision Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers through the Congressional Review Act, while Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could impact cities and states nationwide that have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer (M&S) website is experiencing disruptions, including a complete shutdown, following a cyber attack last month. The retailer estimates the attack will impact this year's profits by around Â£300 million. The attack, which took place over Easter, affected click-and-collect and contactless payments, and some customer data was stolen. The BBC article notes that police are investigating a notorious group of English-speaking hackers, known as Scattered Spider, believed to be behind the attack.</p>
