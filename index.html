          <p>A significant explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, resulted in multiple fatalities and numerous injuries, prompting an investigation into the cause.

The port's strategic location along the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping lane, underscores the potential implications for global trade.

          <p>A conscious parenting coach argues that the seemingly harmless phrase, "You're okay," can be detrimental to a child's emotional development. This phrase can teach children to doubt their emotions, invalidate their experiences, and short-circuit emotional processing.
