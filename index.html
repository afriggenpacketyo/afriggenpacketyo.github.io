        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's state pension is projected to rise by 4.7% next April, an increase of over £500 annually for many recipients. This adjustment is based on the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees pensions increase by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. The likely figure comes from the latest wage data, potentially pushing the new flat-rate pension to over £12,500 a year. However, experts warn that with the personal tax allowance frozen, this rise will pull more pensioners into paying income tax in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to mitigate concerns from foreign investors following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The raid resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, prompting backlash from South Korea and fears it could deter future investment in U.S. manufacturing. In response, President Trump stated that skilled foreign workers are welcome to train the domestic workforce, emphasizing he does not want to disincentivize investment. The U.S. has also reportedly agreed to establish a new visa working group with South Korea to address legal worker pathways.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging a long-standing pattern of malicious reporting. The suit specifically names four journalists and the newspaper itself, claiming a "reckless disregard" for the truth in their articles and a book. This legal action follows the recent publication of a sexually suggestive note from Trump in a "birthday book" for Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges Trump has brought against major media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, ABC, and CBS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UN Human Rights Council report concluding that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza is a detailed and damning indictment that will intensify international condemnation. While Israel and the U.S. have dismissed the findings as biased, the report feeds into growing criticism even from traditional Western allies. The findings are expected to influence a UN General Assembly vote on recognizing Palestinian statehood, a move Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu has condemned. This article suggests the report, despite its legal bar for proving genocide being high, will deepen global divisions over the conflict and challenge Israel's justification of its actions as self-defense.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the political reactions to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, highlighting President Trump's immediate deflection of blame onto "the left." The piece contrasts this partisan response with calls for de-escalation from figures like Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox. It critiques the broader trend of guilt-by-association in politics, citing historical examples and the immediate reactions from figures like Elon Musk.

          <p>A United Nations commission of inquiry has reported that there are reasonable grounds to conclude Israel has committed four of the five defined acts of genocide in Gaza. The report cites the killing of group members, causing serious harm, deliberately inflicting destructive conditions, and preventing births as evidence of genocidal acts. It also points to statements from Israeli leaders, including President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as evidence of genocidal intent. Israel's foreign ministry has categorically rejected the report, calling it "distorted and false" and accusing the commission of serving as "Hamas proxies."</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom is positioned as a welcome diversion for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is facing numerous domestic challenges. These issues include the resignation of a key ally, mass protests over immigration, and internal party dissent. The visit, filled with royal pageantry, is expected to appeal to Trump's sensibilities and reinforce the "special relationship." A key focus will be on securing new trade and investment deals, including partnerships in technology, AI, and nuclear energy, providing Starmer with much-needed positive news amid his government's low approval ratings.</p>

Trump described the boat's cargo as a "deadly weapon poisoning Americans" and hinted that military actions against cartels could expand to land-based operations. The action has drawn criticism from some lawmakers and human rights groups, who question its legality and raise concerns about extrajudicial killings. The Trump administration justifies the strikes as self-defense against narcoterrorist threats, while Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has condemned them as attempts to intimidate and seek regime change.</p>

The study found the true number of deaths to be 39,232, more than 50% higher than previously reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This discrepancy is attributed to coroners not always naming specific drugs on death certificates, with details often confined to toxicology reports inaccessible to the ONS. The findings raise serious concerns that government policies and funding for addiction services have been based on a significant underestimation of the scale of the opioid crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of teenagers in Bradford, UK, participated in a five-day challenge to remove all technology from their bedrooms, leading to some surprising results. Participants, who were accustomed to spending hours on phones and gaming consoles in their rooms, reported sleeping better and feeling more rested for school. The experiment also pushed them to engage in other activities; one student spent evenings baking and researching ballet lessons, while another spent more time with his family in communal areas. The project, part of a BBC initiative, highlights the impact of technology on adolescent sleep patterns and family interaction, prompting discussions about setting healthy boundaries.</p>

          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly among a group of companies involved in a framework deal between the U.S. and China that would allow TikTok to continue its operations in the United States. While the precise structure remains unclear, sources indicate a multi-company solution has been agreed upon in commercial terms, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize the details. The deal aims to resolve long-standing U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and its access to American user data. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, Timothy Garton Ash argues that the United States is in a perilous state and that citizens have a limited window to safeguard its democratic norms from President Trump's executive actions. He contends that the upcoming midterm elections are a crucial first step, as a Congress that can act as a check on presidential power is essential. The author identifies several unique threats to U.S. democracy, including excessive executive power, partisan gerrymandering, and the potential for political violence. He urges Democrats to focus on kitchen-table economic issues to win the midterms, framing it as the most effective way to begin restoring democratic stability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the historical and political inspiration behind the names of China's ballistic missiles, many of which are drawn from the words of Mao Zedong. The prominent "Dongfeng" (East Wind) series, for example, originated from a 1957 speech by Mao in which he stated, "Either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind." This phrase symbolized the ideological struggle between the communist East and the capitalist West. The naming convention reflects a tradition of embedding political and revolutionary significance into the country's military technology, linking modern capabilities with foundational Communist Party ideology.</p>

          <p>An online discussion has highlighted the phenomenon of teachers making a "midnight run"—abruptly quitting their jobs without notice due to extreme stress and difficult working conditions, particularly in high-need schools. Teachers shared anecdotes of colleagues who left mid-day and never returned, sometimes after incidents like having a wig snatched off by students. Many expressed understanding and empathy rather than judgment, viewing such departures as acts of self-preservation in a profession plagued by burnout. The stories paint a grim picture of the pressures facing educators, including underfunding, lack of support, and the emotional toll of the job.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are primarily planning to use Shohei Ohtani as a starting pitcher in the upcoming playoffs, but the team has not ruled out deploying him from the bullpen in certain high-leverage situations. Andrew Friedman, the president of baseball operations, acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could necessitate such a move, similar to how Walker Buehler was used in the past. While Ohtani's role is set as a starter, manager Dave Roberts has kept the conversation open. However, using Ohtani in relief is complicated by MLB's two-way player rule, which would force the Dodgers to lose him as a designated hitter once he exits the mound.</p>

These actions range from allegations of illegal use of race in admissions to civil rights complaints regarding discrimination.
