          <p>Dallas Mavericks' General Manager Nico Harrison addressed the controversial trade of Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers, a move that significantly impacted the team's playoff prospects. Harrison acknowledged the importance of Doncic to the fan base but underestimated the depth of that connection. He justified the trade by stating the team would have championship potential had injuries not plagued key players like Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. Ultimately, the success of the trade will be determined by future outcomes, but the Lakers' acquisition of Doncic has undeniably strengthened their championship aspirations.

          <p>Norwich City has terminated the contract of head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup and appointed former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere as interim manager for the remaining two games of the season.

Sporting director Ben Knapper cited the need for a change despite a long-term focus initially planned for Thorup. Wilshere, previously a first-team coach, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley as they aim to improve Norwich's standing in the league.</p>

          <p>Florida's public university system has entered into formal cooperation agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), granting campus police immigration enforcement powers. This collaboration, spearheaded by Governor Ron DeSantis, contrasts with the resistance seen at elite Northeastern universities. These agreements allow campus police to question, arrest, and prepare charges for suspected immigration violations, effectively acting as “force multipliers for ICE”. The cooperation has sparked student protests and raised concerns about academic freedom and the targeting of international students, particularly those involved in pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

          <p>President Trump's vision for a comprehensive missile defense system, dubbed the 'Golden Dome,' would require a complex and expensive infrastructure, likely including space-based interceptors. Such a system would differ significantly from Israel's Iron Dome, designed for short-range projectiles. Experts debate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a space-based system, with concerns raised about the potential for sparking a new arms race with Russia and China. The effectiveness of such a system is also questioned, as rival nations may adapt by upgrading their nuclear arsenals.</p>
