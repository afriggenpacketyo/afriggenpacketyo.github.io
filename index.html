          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for the hate-crime murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy, has died in custody. Czuba attacked the boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and his mother in October 2023, motivated by their Islamic faith and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. He was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and hate-crime charges after a trial that featured harrowing testimony from the boy's mother. The Council on American-Islamic Relations noted that while the 'depraved killer has died, the hate is still alive and well.'</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it will begin airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and establish corridors for UN convoys to address a worsening hunger crisis. This move comes after intense international pressure and increasing reports of starvation-related deaths, including that of a 5-month-old infant. While Israel stated these actions aim to refute claims of 'deliberate starvation,' UN officials have called the airdrops inefficient and reiterated that only lifting the siege can resolve the 'manmade hunger.' The announcement was made as fighting continues and at least 53 Palestinians were killed in recent strikes and gunfire.</p>

          <h2>Southwest Airlines Flight Executes Rapid Descent to Avoid Mid-Air Collision Over California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 16:21:21 EDT</div>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas executed a rapid dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential mid-air collision with another aircraft shortly after takeoff from Burbank, California. The pilots responded to an onboard traffic alert system, successfully preventing a disaster. Comedian Jimmy Dore, who was on the flight, described how passengers flew out of their seats during the aggressive maneuver. One flight attendant was treated for minor injuries, but the plane continued to its destination and landed safely. The Federal Aviation Administration is currently investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Stars Katey Sagal and Christina Applegate have revealed the behind-the-scenes environment of the sitcom 'Married… With Children' was often tense and cynical. On a recent podcast, Sagal described the cast as a 'sarcastic, cynical bunch,' and Applegate recalled hearing cast members speaking ill of her from her dressing room monitor. Applegate also previously disclosed that the pressure of being portrayed as a sex symbol on the show contributed to a long-lasting eating disorder. Sagal acknowledged the show was 'very misogynistic' and that the intense scrutiny placed on Applegate was significant.</p>

          <p>Over 163 million people across the U.S. Midwest and Southeast are under heat alerts as a severe heat wave continues to bring dangerously high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued warnings with heat indexes expected to reach between 105 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas, from Florida to Virginia and across states like Missouri and Iowa. This extreme heat is caused by a persistent high-pressure system known as a heat dome, trapping hot air over the region. Officials are urging residents to take precautions, stay hydrated, and limit outdoor activities to prevent heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's broad authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is facing a significant legal challenge in a federal appeals court. This lawsuit contests the president's power to levy duties on any country by declaring a national emergency, a power used for most of his major tariffs. A lower court previously struck down the tariffs, but the decision was paused pending this appeal. Legal experts suggest the tariffs are at risk, and a loss for the administration could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariff actions, with the case likely heading to the Supreme Court.</p>

Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who previously ran on an anti-India platform, has since softened his rhetoric, calling India the nation's 'closest and most trusted partner.'

          <p>England's cricket team faces uncertainty over the fitness of its captain, Ben Stokes, heading into the final day of the fourth Test against India. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on day four due to being 'a bit stiff and sore,' according to assistant coach Marcus Trescothick. Stokes, who has a history of injuries, appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his ability to contribute with the ball as England pushes for a victory.

The report, which reviewed over 150 incidents between October 2023 and May 2025, appears to contradict claims by the Trump administration and Israel used to justify limiting aid through traditional channels. The findings indicate that in most cases of aid loss, the perpetrator could not be identified.

          <p>Sir David Nabarro, a distinguished physician and a prominent international public health advocate, has died at the age of 75. Nabarro was a key figure in the global response to numerous health crises, including Ebola, AIDS, and the COVID-19 pandemic, for which he was knighted in 2023. He served as a special envoy for the World Health Organization, where he was a powerful voice for vaccine equity and criticized the politicization of global health responses. Colleagues and world health leaders remember him as a 'great champion of global health' whose work impacted countless lives worldwide.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters gathered outside a hotel in the Norwich area being used to house asylum seekers, with rival demonstrations taking place simultaneously. One group of several hundred anti-immigration protesters, carrying St. George's flags and banners reading 'Stop the invasion,' was met by a smaller group of counter-protesters. The event, which featured speeches from the back of a lorry, was described as largely peaceful but noisy, with a strong police presence to maintain order. This protest is one of several recent demonstrations at asylum accommodations across England, reflecting heightened social and political tensions.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese voters have rejected a large-scale effort to recall two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power after losing its majority in the last election. The recall campaigns were launched by critics who accused the China-friendly KMT of obstructing key legislation and passing reforms that favor Beijing. The KMT framed the result as a victory for political stability, while the DPP stated it humbly accepted the outcome.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, driven by positive news on trade deals and a strong start to the second-quarter earnings season. The market was boosted by President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with other nations. So far, a third of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with 80% beating expectations. Strong reports from companies like GE Vernova and Danaher contributed to the positive sentiment, though some stocks like Honeywell fell despite good results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The debate over daily coffee consumption is complex, with experts advising that the right amount depends heavily on the individual. While studies link one to three cups per day to health benefits, high consumption can have negative effects, and the FDA recommends a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine. Dietitians stress that caffeine tolerance varies, and people should listen to their bodies, stopping if they feel anxious, jittery, or if their sleep is affected. For most healthy adults, two to three cups before noon is considered a safe range, but it is important to be mindful of personal reactions.</p>

These men, who were never convicted of crimes in the U.S., were repatriated as part of a prisoner swap between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments. Their testimonies provide the first detailed accounts of conditions inside the prison, including repeated beatings with rubber bullets, humiliation by guards, and being held in unsanitary conditions with dirty water and lights on all night.

According to internal documents, the 'Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool' is analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of cutting 50% of them by the first anniversary of a potential second Trump inauguration. The tool has already been used at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

          <p>Media executive Tom Rogers, a former self-proclaimed 'raging bull' on Netflix, has expressed new concerns about the streaming giant's future, despite its recent strong earnings report. Rogers noted that while Netflix still dominates in hit shows, its user engagement per viewer has declined, a critical metric for driving price increases and programming budgets. He highlighted the growing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube, which he believes will become more professional-looking with the help of AI tools. This trend, he argues, could pose a significant long-term challenge to Netflix's continued growth.</p>

Investors appear to be focusing more on current issues like rising competition and political backlash against Musk, rather than his futuristic visions.
