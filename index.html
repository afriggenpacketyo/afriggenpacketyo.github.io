          <h2>Aramco Reports Profit Dip Amid Weaker Crude Prices and Production</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco's first-quarter net profit decreased by 5% year-on-year to $26 billion due to lower oil prices and production, though it slightly exceeded analyst expectations. Free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, signaling financial strain amidst global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty impacting energy markets. The company reduced its performance-linked dividend payout but increased its base dividend, resulting in an overall dividend decrease. With OPEC+ production cuts and anticipated supply gluts, banks and energy agencies have downgraded their oil price outlooks for the year.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed optimism regarding upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, emphasizing the potential to save lives and rebuild through trade. This follows Putin's unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine reported was violated, and Zelenskyy's counter-offer of a 30-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy called Putin's offer for direct talks in Istanbul a "positive sign," expressing readiness to meet if Russia confirms a lasting ceasefire starting May 12. Despite previous failed attempts, both leaders are showing tentative signs of willingness to engage in negotiations to end the three-year conflict.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article is a guest essay by Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, who encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and cut themselves some slack. She argues that being flawed is an important part of motherhood, as it teaches children to accept their own imperfections. The article addresses the constant pressure mothers face from various sources, including books, influencers, and even their own children, suggesting they might not be doing enough. Ross includes a lighthearted quiz to help mothers recognize and embrace their imperfections, ultimately urging them to stop wondering if they are good enough.</p>

          <p>The Investigation Discovery docuseries, "The Bakersfield 3: A Tale of Murder and Motherhood," explores the intertwined cases of three missing or murdered individuals in Bakersfield, California. Cheryl Holsonbake, Jane Parrent, and the late Diane Byrne, mothers of the victims, joined forces to find answers when they felt law enforcement wasn't providing enough information. The mothers conducted their own searches, often receiving tips from the public and facing harrowing situations, such as receiving pictures of human remains. Despite Queen's conviction in Micah's death, James's killing remains unsolved, and Baylee is still missing, prompting the mothers to continue urging anyone with information to come forward.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, referencing unsuccessful 2022 talks. This offer followed threats from European leaders to increase pressure on Moscow if it rejects an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, supported by President Trump. Zelenskyy had previously stated he was ready for peace talks only after a ceasefire, while Putin accused Ukraine of repeatedly sabotaging previous ceasefire initiatives. The proposed deal in 2022 included Ukraine's neutral status and limits on its armed forces, with Moscow blaming Kyiv and the West for its collapse.</p>

          <p>A Maryland oral surgeon, Dr. James Ryan, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, ultimately leading to her overdose death. Ryan had reportedly admitted to noticing Sarah when she was only 14 and later provided her with propofol and ketamine, surgical anesthetics that contributed to her death. Sarah's mother, Tina Harris, became suspicious of Ryan and discovered Sarah with drug vials and medical paraphernalia. Text messages revealed Ryan offering and administering the drugs to Sarah, creating a chemical dependency. Ryan was convicted of drug distribution, intent to distribute, and depraved heart murder and sentenced to 45 years in prison.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but below last year's rate. Meanwhile, the rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a subdued spring home-buying season.</p>

          <p>Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz criticized the recently announced UK-US trade deal, deeming it "isn't worth the paper it's written on" due to President Trump's history of reversing trade agreements. Stiglitz suggests the deal plays into Trump's strategy of dividing and conquering weaker countries and advises the UK should have focused on its relationship with the EU instead. The UK-US trade deal includes reduced tariffs on British car and steel exports to the US, while the UK has agreed to remove a tariff on ethanol, used to produce beer. The agreement also opens a new agricultural exchange, with US farmers being given access to the UK for the first time, though UK food standards on imports have not been weakened.</p>

Putin, speaking to reporters, said Russia was “prepared for serious negotiations with Ukraine” and “without any preconditions.” There was no immediate response from Ukraine, but authorities reported an attack by Russian exploding drones that set off air alerts in several cities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump described the first day of high-level trade talks between American and Chinese officials in Switzerland as "very good," signaling a potential "total reset" in US-China trade relations. The talks, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng, aim to de-escalate the ongoing trade war, which has seen tariffs of over 100% imposed on goods from both countries. While Washington seeks an opening of China to American business, Beijing reportedly decided to engage after considering global expectations and appeals from American businesses.</p>

          <p>Opposition politicians in Birmingham reject claims that bin collections are back to normal, citing continued disruptions due to an ongoing strike by refuse workers. The strike, initiated in March over changes to roles and pay, has resulted in widespread waste piles and concerns over public health. While the city council reports clearing most of the rubbish, opposition leaders argue that bin lorries have stalled, leading to a resurgence of waste buildup. A Labour MP accuses the opposition of scoring political points, while urging all parties to resolve the situation.</p>

          <p>After escalating tensions, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, with US President Donald Trump announcing the agreement. Experts suggest that US mediators, along with diplomatic backchannels, played a crucial role in de-escalating the conflict, although accusations of ceasefire violations soon followed. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistan's Army Chief is believed to be a crucial point in the de-escalation. While the US initially appeared standoffish, their intervention ultimately proved indispensable, aided by Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.</p>
