          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to revitalize Cadillac, aiming to restore its status as a leading American luxury car brand. GM President Mark Reuss has been deeply involved, emphasizing the importance of American luxury brands and pushing for Cadillac to showcase GM's capabilities. The strategy involves focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the iconic Escalade, with the goal of creating a consistent brand approach and elevating vehicle residual values. Despite challenges in China and with EV production, Cadillac remains committed to its vision, highlighted by the bespoke Celestiq model, which is currently being relaunched after software issues were addressed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a program offering migrants in the U.S. illegally free airline tickets and a $1,000 stipend to voluntarily return to their home countries. Participants are instructed to use the CBP Home app to notify officials of their departure plans and will be deprioritized for arrest by ICE. The administration frames this as a "dignified way" to leave the U.S., conserving government resources and potentially allowing for legal reentry in the future. However, those who have been in the U.S. illegally for over a year may face a 10-year ban on reentry.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a decline following Warren Buffett's announcement that he will step down and Greg Abel will succeed him as CEO. Buffett, 94, revealed his decision at Berkshire's annual meeting, with the board unanimously voting for Abel to take over on Jan. 1, 2026, while Buffett remains as chairman. Despite the dip, analysts believe Buffett's continued presence as chairman will provide mentorship and guidance during the transition, the news is still of epic proportions for the company. The transition marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which has grown into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate under Buffett's leadership.</p>

Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, old technology, and DOGE cuts to the FAA as contributing factors. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark due to the disruptions, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area."

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is restarting "involuntary collections" on federal student loans in default, which may seriously damage borrowers' credit scores. A TransUnion analysis found that consumers facing default have seen their credit scores fall by an average of 63 points, with super prime borrowers experiencing drops of up to 175 points. Experts warn that the impact is more severe for borrowers with better credit, potentially leading to higher interest rates on loans and difficulty obtaining credit.
