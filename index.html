          <p>Amidst escalating tensions and military operations, India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, according to statements from both countries. While President Trump claimed the agreement was brokered by the United States after a long night of talks, officials from India and Pakistan indicated that the deal was worked out directly between the two nations. The ceasefire announcement followed days of rising tensions and fighting, with global leaders urging both nuclear-armed nations to engage in dialogue to de-escalate the conflict. This agreement comes after a deadly shooting of tourists in the disputed territory of Kashmir, marking a significant step towards peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Personal finance guru Ric Edelman is urging for increased financial literacy in America, emphasizing the importance of providing better financial education, especially to younger generations. He expressed concern that many young investors are drawn to get-rich-quick schemes and overly complicated financial products, often influenced by social media platforms like TikTok. Edelman believes that the lack of mandatory personal finance courses in high schools leaves young adults unprepared for critical financial decisions such as buying a car, securing a mortgage, and saving for college. He highlights the need for credible sources of financial information and cautions against the complexities introduced by corporate America.</p>

The author, who taught the class for over a decade, describes how the program provided a safe space for women to express themselves and reclaim their identities. The decision to cut funding, which also affected substance use treatment, re-entry programs, and the Lullaby Project, was made after the Trump administration declared Maine out of compliance with "agency priorities".

          <p>The Labour Party is set to reveal its immigration plans, aiming to address public concerns and regain voter trust. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's White Paper will outline strict time limits for work visas for non-graduate jobs, potential loss of stay rights for foreign students, and higher English proficiency requirements. Companies failing to prioritize UK-based staff may lose the right to sponsor foreign workers. The plans also seek to modify how judges apply Article 8 of the Human Rights Act to prevent deportations. The government aims to link the immigration system to the labor market, promoting skills development for British workers.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, which failed to launch to Venus in 1972, reentered Earth's atmosphere on Saturday. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, and the European Space Agency indicated that the spacecraft had reentered after failing to appear over a German radar station. It was not immediately known where the spacecraft came down or how much of it survived the descent, though some experts believed parts of the half-ton spacecraft could survive. The chances of anyone getting hit by debris were considered exceedingly low.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's government overhaul, citing a lack of congressional authorization for large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with a coalition of unions, non-profits, and local governments in blocking mass layoffs for 14 days. The ruling challenges the work of the "department of government efficiency" (Doge), with dozens of lawsuits alleging violations of privacy laws and exceeding authority. The court scheduled a hearing for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction, stating that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid President Trump's "Too Late" label as he navigates a volatile policy mix with threats to both growth and inflation. Economists suggest that the Fed's historical tendency to act slowly could lead to being behind the curve, particularly with Trump's tariffs adding complexity. While Trump is pushing for rate cuts, Powell has expressed confidence in the economy and dismissed pre-emptive cuts, emphasizing the need for more clarity before taking action. The Fed's reluctance to hike rates when inflation began spiking in 2021 serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the risks of being too late to respond.</p>
