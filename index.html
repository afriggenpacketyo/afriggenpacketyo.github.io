        <h2>Inflation Reports and Federal Reserve Response</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-13 15:04:57 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Despite seemingly positive February inflation reports, underlying trends suggest the Federal Reserve will likely maintain interest rates. Economists point to the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) as a key indicator, which is expected to show inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target. While some positive signs exist for future months, the current data is unlikely to prompt a rate cut.</p>
