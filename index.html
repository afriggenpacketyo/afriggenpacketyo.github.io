          <p>Construction has commenced on a new $250 million ballroom at the White House, sparking ethical debates over its funding model. President Donald Trump has stated he will personally contribute, with the remainder sourced from anonymous corporate and wealthy donors, including companies like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Amazon. Ethics experts, such as former White House lawyer Richard Painter, have voiced concerns that this method could be perceived as a "pay-to-play" scheme, granting donors privileged access to the administration. The White House maintains that the project is a necessary renovation for future administrations and denies any impropriety in soliciting the donations.</p>

The browser allows users to access ChatGPT in a sidebar on any webpage, offering features like summarization and in-window task execution. This move places OpenAI in direct competition with established players like Google and emerging rivals such as Perplexity AI. The announcement had an immediate market impact, causing shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, to drop by approximately 3%.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel must testify in an upcoming trial concerning the alleged adverse effects of social media on young users. The judge determined that the testimony of the CEOs is uniquely relevant to claims that their companies knowingly designed addictive features that caused harm to minors. Despite arguments from Meta and Snap that the CEOs' appearance would be disruptive and unnecessary, the court found their insights crucial for the case. This trial is one of several legal challenges social media companies face over child safety and mental health.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not proceed in the immediate future. The proposed summit in Budapest was shelved after preparatory talks revealed significant differences regarding a peace deal for Ukraine. Russia has insisted on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from eastern regions as a precondition, a stance Kyiv and its allies reject. Conversely, the U.S. and European leaders have supported a proposal to freeze the conflict along the current front lines, which Moscow dismissed as a temporary solution.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Israel, U.S. Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is progressing better than anticipated, despite recent outbreaks of violence. Accompanied by Jared Kushner, Vance emphasized the need for patience as both sides transition from intense conflict to a peacetime posture, acknowledging the difficulties in implementing aspects of the deal like Hamas's disarmament. The agreement has seen incremental progress with the exchange of hostages and remains, though some analysts and former Israeli officials express skepticism about its long-term viability, citing a lack of trust between the parties.</p>

          <p>Humanitarian organizations report that Israel is implementing new, stringent registration requirements that threaten the ability of major international NGOs to operate in Gaza and the West Bank. These measures come as Israel continues to restrict aid into Gaza, where famine has been declared in some areas. Aid groups state the new rules are ideologically driven, with approvals now involving an Israeli ministry focused on combating antisemitism, and are being used to reject or delay applications from established organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council. This move further complicates relief efforts already hampered by the ban on the UN's primary Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA.</p>

          <p>The French Ministry of Culture has confirmed that the priceless crown jewels stolen from the Louvre museum were not covered by private insurance. Under French law, national museum collections are considered state property and are not insured unless they are being loaned to another institution. As a result, the state will bear the full financial loss of the heist. Criminology experts express confidence that the perpetrators will be caught but are pessimistic about the recovery of the jewels, which are likely to be dismantled and their gems sold on the black market. The incident has also highlighted significant security vulnerabilities at the world-renowned museum.</p>

This follows the departure of two other survivors who raised concerns about the potential appointment of a chair with a background in policing or social work, arguing it represents a conflict of interest.

          <p>An analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to rising inflation in the U.S. The research found that from May to July, companies passed approximately 35% of tariff-related costs on to consumers, leading to notable price increases in categories like furniture, car parts, and electronics. The study concluded that these tariffs added a measurable 0.5 percentage points to the headline inflation rate between June and August.

          <p>Indonesia and Britain have signed an agreement to repatriate Lindsay Sandiford, a British grandmother who has been on death row for over a decade after a 2013 drug trafficking conviction. Sandiford, now in her late 60s and reportedly seriously ill, was arrested in Bali with cocaine valued at over $2 million. She claimed a syndicate had threatened her son's life to force her to carry the drugs. Another British national serving a life sentence for drug offenses will also be transferred. This move is part of a recent trend by Indonesia's new administration to repatriate several high-profile foreign inmates.</p>

          <h2>New Documentary Explores George Orwell's Enduring Relevance and Society's Complacency</h2>

          <p>A new documentary by filmmaker Raoul Peck, titled "Orwell: 2+2=5," examines the prescient warnings in George Orwell's novel "1984" and argues that society has become numb to their realization. Using materials from the Orwell estate, the film traces the authoritarian tactics Orwell described, such as the suppression of truth and the manipulation of language, and connects them to contemporary political phenomena. Peck contends that while generations have recognized the dystopian parallels in the real world, this recognition has often led to complacency rather than meaningful action. The film frames the rise of authoritarianism as an insidious infection that society has failed to effectively combat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coroner has ruled that neglect likely contributed to the death of Cerys Lupton-Jones, a 22-year-old patient at a Greater Manchester mental health facility. An inquest found that staff falsified observation records, stating she was safe when she was in fact in a toilet where she would fatally harm herself. The coroner described aspects of the care provided as a "shambles," noting that the tragedy might have been averted if staff had remained with her after a previous suicide attempt. The case has intensified calls for a broader inquiry into the mental health trust.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson testified before the Covid-19 Inquiry, addressing the government's decision to close schools during the pandemic, a move he described as a "personal horror." The inquiry is examining the lasting negative impacts of the closures on children's education, attendance, and development. Evidence presented suggested a lack of preparedness, with former officials stating there was no formal plan for closures until the day before they were announced. Johnson defended the decision-making process, while leaked messages revealed tensions between him and the then-Education Secretary, highlighting the chaotic environment at the heart of government.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American to lead New York's historic Central Synagogue, shared her perspective on faith and empathy in a recent interview. Born to a Jewish American father and a Korean Buddhist mother, she described how her experience of feeling like an outsider in multiple communities cultivated a "radical compassion" that defines her leadership. Buchdahl's sermons, which attract thousands of online viewers, often address inclusion and shared humanity, themes she explores in her new memoir. She emphasized that empathy for others, especially during times of conflict and rising antisemitism, is not a betrayal but a fundamental aspect of faith.</p>

Many of the top accounts are provided by online banks, which can offer better rates due to lower overhead costs. Options from banks like Newtek, BrioDirect, and Openbank feature APYs well over 4%, with varying requirements for minimum deposits and balances. These accounts provide a way for savers to grow their funds more rapidly while maintaining liquidity, making them an attractive choice for emergency funds or other savings goals.

          <p>U.S. cattle ranchers are expressing concern over President Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina, arguing it fails to address fundamental threats to the domestic supply chain. Ranchers are currently contending with the potential re-emergence of the parasitic screwworm from Mexico and ongoing drought conditions, which have reduced the U.S. cattle herd to its lowest level since 1951. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association stated the plan would create market chaos without lowering consumer prices. They advocate for government focus on biosecurity and eradicating the screwworm threat rather than market interventions that could harm American producers.</p>
