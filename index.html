          <h2>West Indies Cricket Team Suffers Historic Batting Collapse Against Australia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 14:48:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The West Indies cricket team was dismissed for just 27 runs against Australia, their second-lowest score in Test match history. The batting collapse is attributed to a combination of a bowler-friendly pitch, the skill of Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc, and a series of poor shots from the West Indian batters. This result highlights the ongoing decline of West Indies cricket from its dominant era in the 1970s and 80s. In response, Cricket West Indies has convened an emergency meeting with legendary former players to address the team's performance and plan for rebuilding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is accelerating efforts to secure a domestic supply of critical minerals and rare earth elements, aiming to counter China's market dominance. The Defense Department recently acquired a direct equity stake in MP Materials, the operator of the only rare earth mine in the U.S., making the government its largest shareholder. This public-private partnership is seen as a model for strengthening national security by onshoring vital industrial supply chains. The U.S. government has invested $540 million to support this initiative, which is crucial for producing military technology like F-35 fighter jets and submarines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Country artist Ella Langley revealed that musician Kid Rock has a unique post-show ritual designed to enhance his performances. He allegedly records every concert and immediately watches the footage with his band, the Twisted Brown Trucker Band, in their greenroom. This practice mirrors how football teams analyze game tapes to identify areas for improvement and refine their strategy. The routine underscores Kid Rock's dedication to his craft and his professional approach to live entertainment.

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was questioned by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about a past controversy. Democrats pressed Waltz on his removal from his national security role after he added a journalist to a private Signal group chat discussing military strikes in Yemen. Waltz defended his actions, stating the White House investigation resulted in no disciplinary action, but some senators called the incident "disqualifying." Despite the scrutiny, Waltz is expected to be confirmed, with Republicans supporting his pledge to counter Chinese influence at the UN.</p>

          <p>A transgender woman from Mexico, seeking asylum in the United States, has been released from an ICE detention center in Washington. Her release follows an order from a federal judge in Oregon, who ruled that she had been deprived of her liberty without due process. The woman, identified as O-J-M, had been arrested at an immigration court in Portland in June and was held for over 40 days. She originally sought asylum after being sexually assaulted by cartel members in Mexico due to her gender identity, and her attorneys state she is now safely home with her family.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine should not use U.S.-supplied long-range weapons to attack Moscow, clarifying comments he reportedly made in a private call.

The White House asserted that Trump was merely asking a question and is focused on ending the war. The clarification follows Trump's recent announcement of a new weapons deal for Ukraine and a 50-day ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe secondary tariffs.</p>

However, Jakarta has not yet publicly confirmed these terms, and the details remain unclear.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's New Ukraine Strategy Requires Concerted Effort to Succeed</h2>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores President Trump's recent policy shift on Ukraine, which includes selling weapons to NATO allies for transfer to Kyiv and issuing a 50-day ceasefire ultimatum to Russia. The article argues that for this new approach to be effective, it must be part of a broader strategy to change the dynamics on the battlefield and convince Russia it cannot win. This will require overcoming internal resistance within the administration and establishing a dedicated team to manage the effort. The author suggests this is the only plausible way to compel Russia to accept a sovereign Ukraine and bring the war to an end.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Moves to End Bond Hearings for Certain Immigrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 13:57:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly implementing a new policy to deny bond hearings to millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. without legal status and are in deportation proceedings. An internal ICE memo states that the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department have determined that these individuals are not eligible for release from custody. This marks a significant shift from previous policy, which generally allowed such immigrants to request a bond hearing before a judge. The move, which is expected to face legal challenges, follows recent congressional funding to expand immigrant detention capacity.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of approximately 15 million Americans. The judge ruled that the agency exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule, which had been praised by consumer advocates, aimed to alleviate the burden of $49 billion in medical debt, which the CFPB argued is a poor predictor of a consumer's creditworthiness. The decision is a setback for consumers who get tangled in complex medical billing issues, though some states have their own protections.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank's net income rose 25% from the previous year to $4.02 billion, with overall revenue up 8% to $21.67 billion. The strong performance, particularly in equity trading, was aided by market volatility during the quarter. CEO Jane Fraser noted the bank is making progress on its transformation plan and is exploring the use of stablecoins, while also setting aside more funds for potential credit losses due to economic deterioration.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has indicated that Canada might have to accept some U.S. tariffs as part of a new trade agreement with the Trump administration. Speaking to reporters, Carney noted that President Trump's trade negotiations have consistently included tariffs, suggesting a deal without any levies is unlikely. The statement comes as the U.S. threatens to impose a new 35% duty on Canadian goods, escalating a trade dispute that has been ongoing since Trump took office. While much cross-border trade is protected by the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), key Canadian sectors like auto manufacturing and metals remain vulnerable. (not investment advice)</p>

However, advocacy groups sued, and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals has paused the termination for one week to review the case. The ruling provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans who rely on TPS, a program expanded after the Taliban's 2021 takeover of the country.</p>
