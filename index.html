          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 17:56:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the Insurrection Act, a 218-year-old law that allows the president to deploy federal troops in a state against its government under specific circumstances, last used in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots. President Trump has hinted at invoking the act to quell protests in Los Angeles over his administration's immigration crackdown, despite objections from California's governor. The article also details how Trump mobilized the National Guard under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which allows the president to call on federal service members in cases of rebellion or inability to enforce laws, while the governor is suing the administration over the deployment. The situation raises legal questions about the extent of presidential authority in curbing protests. Optimism is tempered by the potential for federal overreach and the escalation of tensions. </p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), a key advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an effort to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science. Kennedy claims that the ACIP committee members have serious conflicts of interests, but a key government report he cited to back up the claim shows they do not. The American Medical Association criticized Kennedy's decision, stating that it undermines trust and disrupts a transparent process that has saved countless lives. This move signals a significant shift in the administration's approach to vaccine policy. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new "Trump Savings Account" program as part of a GOP megabill, which would provide $1,000 to each newborn in a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund. The account would allow additional contributions up to $5,000 annually from family, friends, and others, with the funds intended to be used for college or a down payment on a home when the child reaches adulthood. House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the policy as a "transformative" measure to give American children a financial head start. Trump expressed optimism that the accounts would contribute to the lifelong success of millions of babies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to arrests and the deployment of the National Guard. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, sparking clashes between protesters and authorities. The National Guard was deployed by President Trump, triggering a political row with state politicians who condemned the move as an illegal act. The protests have involved setting vehicles alight, shutting down a major freeway, and reports of looting, while the role of the National Guard is to protect federal agents. </p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400m defamation lawsuit against his former co-star Blake Lively. Lively filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios in December 2024, alleging she was sexually harassed on set and that Baldoni retaliated against her for bringing those complaints, among other allegations. The judge determined that Baldoni and his company had not proved defamation because the "Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements" in her lawsuit, which are privileged. Judge Liman said Baldoni would be allowed to amend and refile his allegations related to interference with contracts by 23 June. </p>
