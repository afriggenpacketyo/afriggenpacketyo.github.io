          <p>Three deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's arson and explosives detail were killed in an explosion at a training facility in Monterey Park. The incident represents the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. Investigators believe an explosive device, thought to be inert after being collected from a callout the previous day, unexpectedly detonated. Sheriff Robert Luna described the deputies as experts in their field and expressed profound sorrow, calling it an isolated incident with no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>After days of criticism from his base over the handling of Jeffrey Epstein-related files, President Trump has seen a significant rally in support from key MAGA figures. This shift followed a Wall Street Journal article alleging a 2003 letter from Trump to Epstein, which Trump denies and is suing over, and his subsequent call to release grand jury testimony. Influential supporters who were previously critical are now defending the president, unifying against the media and framing the administration's actions as a victory for transparency.</p>

          <p>According to a new biography by Amy Odell, Gwyneth Paltrow had reservations about her relationship with Brad Pitt in the 1990s, believing she was more sophisticated and better educated. The book claims that despite her father and friends adoring Pitt, Paltrow expressed doubts, feeling his Missouri upbringing was a world apart from her own in Manhattan. The author cites Paltrow's own past comments about having to explain different types of caviar to Pitt as an example of their differing backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Following mounting public and political pressure, President Trump has requested the Department of Justice to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Pam Bondi subsequently filed a motion in federal court to unseal the transcripts, citing significant public interest. This move comes as Trump continues to distance himself from Epstein and has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over a report about a letter he allegedly sent to the financier.</p>

          <p>Veteran value investor Bill Smead has issued a stark warning about the current stock market rally, suggesting it has reached a critical resistance level. He presented a chart showing that inflation-adjusted S&P 500 returns have hit a trend line previously seen only at major market peaks in 1966 and 2000, both of which preceded significant downturns. Smead believes the market is in a vulnerable position, driven by froth in growth stocks, and is positioned for a period of poor returns over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Championships were finally presented with their gold medals at the London Diamond League meeting. The team was upgraded from silver after the US team was disqualified due to a 2008 doping confession by team member Antonio Pettigrew. After a lengthy process, former athletes Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton received their long-overdue medals in front of a home crowd. The moment was described as a chance to recognize their talent and the values they stood for.</p>

          <p>Russia launched another large-scale overnight air assault on Ukraine, striking ten regions and killing at least three people. The attack utilized over 340 drones and 35 missiles, with targets including a residential building in Odesa and industrial sites in Pavlohrad. In the northeastern city of Sumy, critical infrastructure was damaged, causing power outages for thousands. While Ukraine's military reported intercepting the majority of the projectiles, the barrage highlights Russia's continued and intense bombardment of civilian and infrastructure targets across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has reportedly revoked the visas of eight Brazilian supreme court judges, escalating a campaign to support former president Jair Bolsonaro, who faces trial for an alleged coup attempt. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets the judge leading the investigation and his colleagues. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the action as "unacceptable interference" and an "affront to national sovereignty." The sanctions follow President Trump's earlier threat of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, a move that has sparked nationalist backlash in Brazil and may be backfiring politically.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commented on the ongoing pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that even a full court-approved release of grand jury testimony would not be enough for his critics. In a social media post, he referred to those demanding more information as "troublemakers and radical left lunatics," suggesting their demands would never cease.

Such a move could undermine the central bank's independence, potentially leading to market instability, higher inflation, and increased long-term interest rates, even if the goal is to force rate cuts.

Instead, he advises people to find the intersection of what they are good at and what can be lucrative. Galloway emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and being able to pivot, rather than blindly pursuing a passion. This sentiment is echoed by other leaders, who suggest a more practical approach of combining one's strengths with real-world opportunities to build a successful career.</p>
