          <p>A group of Japanese doctors and social workers are calling for an end to COVID-19 restrictions in hospitals, arguing they violate human rights by limiting patient visitations, even for terminally ill individuals. Despite the government downgrading the threat level of COVID-19, many hospitals still enforce strict rules such as mask requirements, temperature checks, and visitor limits. These restrictions have led to situations where families are unable to see their loved ones, including grandchildren being denied visits. One doctor, an infectious disease specialist, pointed out that these measures contradict scientific evidence and that other countries have eased restrictions without increased infection rates.</p>

Park officials are anticipating a busy season and are requiring reservations for visitors entering between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. during the holiday weekend, with potential staffing shortages due to cuts at the National Park Service.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners' job stress and stress-related behaviors in their pets, such as whining and restlessness. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one individual to another within a household, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on their owners' moods through subtle cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pets' well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts while at home.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have reportedly achieved a technological breakthrough with the development of a capacitor-free electromagnetic coilgun, capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. This advancement, powered directly by lithium batteries, eliminates the lag time associated with recharging capacitors, a previous limitation in electromagnetic weapons. The technology has been demonstrated in videos showing the coilgun's ability to shatter car windows and demolish door panels rapidly.

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. The government has hailed the move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on improved services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure. While lower fares were not promised, passengers were assured they would get "great value for money." SWR trains will now be managed by the Department for Transport Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is implementing new policies that significantly restrict press access within the Pentagon. The new rules ban reporters from many areas, including the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, without an approved government escort. Hegseth cited national security concerns as the reason for the changes, while the Pentagon Press Association has condemned the move as an attack on freedom of the press. The National Press Club has urged the Pentagon to reverse the decision, arguing that restricting access undermines public trust.</p>

While her work was praised for its impact, it also faced criticism for its generalizations about men and its views on women's responsibility in avoiding sexual assault. Brownmiller remained a vocal advocate against pornography and sexual violence throughout her life.</p>
