          <p>Department of Justice officials have charged members of an Armenian organized crime ring with stealing over $83 million worth of cargo from Amazon by posing as truck drivers. The scheme, which operated across California since at least 2021, involved diverting truckloads of merchandise, including smart TVs and appliances, from their designated routes and reselling the stolen goods. Amazon is cooperating with DOJ officials, sharing information about the stolen goods and fraudulent accounts. The defendants are also linked to other alleged crimes, including attempted murder and kidnapping.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cautioned that a "fundamental regime change" might be occurring in financial markets as investors reconsider the riskiness of U.S. assets, particularly in light of ongoing trade tensions driven by U.S. tariff policies. The ECB's Financial Stability Review noted that markets have been sensitive to trade-related updates, with some shifts away from traditional safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar. ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos suggested that elevated valuations and strong uncertainty could lead to a market correction, emphasizing the need to consider these factors. </p>

          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, citing growth in sales to home professionals as a counterbalance to slower demand from do-it-yourself customers. While the company's quarterly sales slightly missed expectations, earnings exceeded estimates, with CEO Marvin Ellison attributing the resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service. The article indicates that Lowe's expects full-year sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year.

          <p>The frequency of cardiac arrests in U.S. workplaces is a growing concern, with over 10,000 people experiencing them annually. Unlike high-profile cases where immediate medical intervention is available, many workplaces lack the necessary preparedness, leading to fatal outcomes. The American Heart Association's data reveals that 70% of Americans feel unable to act during a cardiac emergency, contributing to the 90% fatality rate for cardiac arrests outside of a hospital when CPR is not immediately administered. Efforts are underway to increase awareness and training in CPR, but significant gaps remain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is investigating whether the Trump administration deported migrants to South Sudan in violation of an order barring deportations to countries other than their own. Judge Brian Murphy ordered the government to "maintain custody and control" of anyone deported to South Sudan, ensuring their return if the removals are deemed unlawful. The order followed an emergency motion from attorneys alleging that at least 12 migrants had been sent to the East African country. The Justice Department lawyer claimed that one of the men had been deported to Myanmar, not South Sudan.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has allegedly been paying nursing homes bonuses to reduce hospital transfers, a practice that has saved the company millions but potentially risked residents' health. A Guardian investigation revealed that UnitedHealth stationed its medical teams in nursing homes, incentivizing them to cut care expenses. In some cases, residents needing immediate hospital care were denied it due to interventions from UnitedHealth staffers, resulting in severe health consequences. The company denies preventing hospital transfers, stating that its programs improve health outcomes and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>The FDA is planning to restrict future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or with high-risk conditions, requiring vaccine makers to conduct lengthy placebo-controlled trials for broader approval. FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary and vaccine head Dr. Vinay Prasad argue that annual boosters are not worth the risk for healthy people. Experts caution that lengthy trials may result in vaccines ineffective against current variants. Some argue the restrictions could hinder access for those wanting to protect vulnerable family members, while others question the necessity of annual boosters for young and healthy individuals.</p>
