        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the renewed diplomatic focus on the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral forum amid shifting global geopolitics. For Russia, facing Western isolation over the Ukraine war, reviving RIC offers a platform to demonstrate non-Western solidarity, reaffirm its Eurasian influence, and balance its growing dependency on China. While Beijing supports the initiative to stabilize its continental flank, New Delhi remains cautious, balancing its strategic autonomy with the potential benefits of regional cooperation. The piece questions whether this renewed interest is a genuine strategic alignment or merely a pragmatic response to current international pressures.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting strategies and strong business performance, which caused its stock to rise. The pharmaceutical giant's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely driven by sales from its COVID-19 products and other key drugs. The updated outlook accounts for a significant one-time charge related to a licensing deal with a Chinese drugmaker for a cancer treatment. The company's forecast also considers potential impacts from the Trump administration's calls for lower drug prices and tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article highlights Bangladesh's remarkable public health achievements over the past decades, including significant increases in life expectancy and reductions in mortality rates despite low GDP spending on health. It expresses concern that the recent political transition, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, could jeopardize this progress. The author urges global health organizations like the WHO and UNICEF to provide urgent support to the new interim government to preserve these gains. The piece emphasizes the need for international cooperation to help Bangladesh navigate challenges like the 'double burden' of infectious and non-communicable diseases and ensure continued investment in its health infrastructure.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 08:52:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including eleven £100,000 awards, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom, sparking criticism of the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I). Critics argue that the government-owned bank's processes for tracing winners are inadequate, particularly for older, non-digitized bonds or those gifted to individuals who may be unaware they own them. While NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of prizes since 1957, consumer advocates and solicitors are calling for reforms to make it easier for people to claim their winnings, especially during the current cost of living crisis. The oldest unclaimed prize is a £25 win from November 1957.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska encountered a hostile audience during a town hall in Lincoln, where he was repeatedly heckled and booed while defending a major policy and tax bill from the Trump administration. The crowd expressed anger over the bill's impact on healthcare, particularly Medicaid, and tax provisions, with chants of "Tax the Rich!" and "vote him out!" interrupting the congressman's explanations. Flood argued the bill provided a middle-class tax cut and implemented reasonable work requirements for healthcare benefits for non-disabled adults. Despite his attempts to address concerns, the audience remained largely unsatisfied throughout the contentious event.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant bid for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, in a deal that could be worth up to £73.8 million. The offer is said to include a guaranteed payment of £65.2 million, with the remainder in potential add-ons. While RB Leipzig has not yet responded, Manchester United believes the valuation is fair and that the Slovenian international is interested in a move to the club.

          <p>One year after student-led protests led to a major political upheaval in Bangladesh, the family of Abu Sayed, a student killed by police, is still demanding justice. His death, captured on live television, became a turning point in the unrest that ultimately led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. While an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was initially met with hope, a sense of disillusionment is now growing across the country amid concerns over its failure to tackle mob violence and high unemployment. The article explores the lingering pain of victims' families and the broader societal frustration with the slow pace of promised reforms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that the field of potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair has been narrowed to four individuals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, previously considered a top contender, has reportedly taken himself out of the running, preferring to remain in his current role. This development comes after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation, which gives Trump another opportunity to appoint a new member to the Fed's board. Among the likely remaining candidates are former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, both of whom have advocated for lower interest rates.

          <p>Thousands of households in Scotland, primarily in the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire, are still without electricity as cleanup operations continue after Storm Floris. Power company SSEN described the storm as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, having initially cut power to 72,000 homes. While service has been restored to 50,000, around 22,000 remained affected, with some expected to be without power until Wednesday or Thursday due to complex, tree-related damage. The storm also caused widespread travel disruption, with numerous train routes and roads closed due to fallen trees and debris amid wind gusts of up to 90mph.</p>

Writing in the Telegraph, Corbyn, a passionate allotmenteer, warned that selling these protected green spaces makes their future more perilous and argued that social housing needs can be met without sacrificing them. The sites, located across England, are protected by the 1925 Allotment Act, which requires ministerial approval for their disposal. A government spokesperson stated that sales should only occur when necessary and offer value, while the Conservatives labeled the policy a "kick in the teeth" to residents without gardens.</p>

A Kremlin spokesperson characterized the U.S. threats as illegitimate attempts to force countries to sever trade relations with Moscow.

The piece suggests that Sweeney is skillfully navigating modern celebrity by being unapologetically commercial and embracing a larger-than-life persona, which is what audiences traditionally desire from movie stars.

          <p>Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora is confronting skepticism from Wall Street following the company's largest-ever acquisition, the $25 billion purchase of Israeli identity security firm CyberArk. The deal, which aims to create a comprehensive cybersecurity platform, was met with a 16% drop in Palo Alto's stock price and analyst downgrades. Arora defended the acquisition, stating that CyberArk's identity management technology is a critical component in an era of sophisticated, AI-driven cyber threats. Having overseen more than 20 smaller deals, Arora expressed confidence in his team's ability to integrate the new company and accelerate innovation in the competitive cybersecurity market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" on its 100th anniversary, arguing its most enduring theme is its profound exploration of the midlife crisis. The author notes that Woolf herself was 40 when she began the novel, a period she saw as a time to take stock of one's life. The narrative follows its 51-year-old protagonist, Clarissa Dalloway, through a single day as she contemplates her past choices, her present existence, and her future, embodying the formlessness and transformative nature of middle age. The piece concludes that the novel is a testament to finding joy and meaning in the present moment, a victory of life over the ever-present shadow of death.</p>

          <p>The recent termination of the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has created a significant void in global public health data. For nearly 40 years, the DHS Program served as a vital source of standardized health information for over 90 countries, tracking metrics like maternal health, disease prevalence, and gender-based violence. The shutdown, part of a broader foreign aid cut, has halted dozens of in-progress surveys and raised concerns that the loss of this data will hinder the ability of governments and aid organizations to target life-saving interventions effectively. Philanthropic organizations are providing temporary funding, but a long-term, sustainable solution is urgently needed.</p>

          <p>The Indian military has been deployed to the northern state of Uttarakhand following a deadly cloudburst that triggered severe flash floods and a massive mudslide. The disaster has washed away the Himalayan village of Dharali, destroying homes, hotels, and a local market, with at least four people confirmed dead and over 50 feared missing. Rescue operations are underway on a "war footing," but the remote and difficult terrain is posing significant challenges for emergency teams. The Himalayan region is frequently susceptible to such events during monsoon season, with climate change believed to be intensifying their severity and frequency.</p>

          <p>This article examines India's recent and rapid rise to prominence in the world of competitive chess, a shift from decades of Russian and European dominance. It highlights the success of young Indian players, such as 19-year-old Divya Deshmukh, who recently won the FIDE Women's World Cup, and 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju, the youngest-ever world champion. The piece attributes this success to a combination of factors, including a strong grassroots coaching culture, particularly in the city of Chennai, supportive parents who see chess as an academic pursuit, and increased financial viability for a career in the sport. The global resurgence of chess, amplified by the pandemic and online platforms, has also benefited India's growing talent pool.</p>

          <p>A Fulton County grand jury has declined to indict former Atlanta police officer Kiran Kimbrough on manslaughter and other charges in the 2023 death of 62-year-old church deacon Johnny Hollman. Hollman died after being tased and restrained during a struggle with the officer, which began when he refused to sign a citation after a minor car accident. Body camera footage showed Hollman repeatedly saying, "I can't breathe." While the death was ruled a homicide with heart disease as a contributing factor, the officer's attorney argued Hollman's death was caused by medical complications and his resistance. The city previously fired Kimbrough and settled a $3.8 million lawsuit with the family.</p>

          <p>According to Israeli media reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is planning to propose a full military reoccupation of the Gaza Strip to his security cabinet. This potential move would involve a complete conquest of the territory to defeat Hamas and comes after the breakdown of ceasefire talks. The proposal is expected to face opposition from military leaders, the families of hostages who fear for their loved ones' safety, and many of Israel's international allies who are pushing for a humanitarian resolution. Critics, including hundreds of former Israeli security officials, argue that further military action would be futile and that a political solution is the only way to defeat Hamas's ideology.</p>

          <p>Energy giant BP has announced it will conduct a thorough review of its oil and gas assets to boost profitability and shareholder returns, continuing its strategic shift back toward fossil fuels. This pledge follows the company's largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years, located in deep water off the coast of Brazil, which could become a major production hub. Under pressure from investors for underperforming rivals, CEO Murray Auchincloss stated that BP "can and will do better," initiating a new cost review alongside the asset evaluation. This move reinforces BP's recent decision to scale back investments in renewables in favor of its core oil and gas operations. (not investment advice)</p>

Pizza Hut's global sales also fell, hurt by weaker demand in its home market. In contrast, Taco Bell remained a strong performer, with 4% same-store sales growth both domestically and internationally, continuing to be the bright spot in Yum's portfolio.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm a total of nearly £46 million over the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. Woodford faces a personal fine of almost £6 million and a ban from senior roles, while his firm was fined £40 million, for making "unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions" that prioritized illiquid assets. These actions disadvantaged the 300,000 investors who remained in the fund when it was suspended, as they were unable to withdraw their money. Both Woodford and his firm are appealing the FCA's findings.</p>

          <p>NASA is reportedly fast-tracking plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030 to support a permanent human settlement and a future lunar economy. According to media reports, the agency's acting head cited similar plans by China and Russia as a reason for the urgency, expressing concern those nations could declare exclusive zones on the lunar surface. The move has surprised some scientists, given recent NASA budget cuts, and raised concerns that the timeline is driven more by geopolitical competition than scientific goals. Experts agree nuclear power is likely the most viable option for continuous energy on the Moon, where two-week periods of darkness make solar power challenging.</p>
