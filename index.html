          <p>The Trump administration announced a new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, sending shockwaves through the technology and finance sectors. Major companies like Amazon, JPMorgan, and Microsoft advised their visa-holding employees to remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel due to the uncertainty. The move, which does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, represents the administration's most significant effort to restrict legal employment-based immigration. Foreign governments, particularly India, are assessing the impact, with India's Ministry of External Affairs expressing concern over potential "humanitarian consequences" for families.

          <p>A California high school girls' volleyball team with a transgender player has experienced additional game forfeits from opposing teams. This follows a lawsuit filed by three current and former teammates against the school district and state agencies, citing a hostile environment. The lawsuit, brought by players from Catholic and Muslim families, argues that their religious beliefs about gender and modesty are being violated. School and state officials have largely deferred responsibility, noting they are following a state law passed in 2013, which would require legislative action to change.</p>

The man, identified as Joshua Runkles, was reportedly exhibiting suspicious behavior and falsely claimed to be a law enforcement officer while carrying a weapon. Law enforcement sources indicated he was working as private security for an influencer attending the memorial. The event, which will feature speeches from President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, has been designated a high-security SEAR Level 1 event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth, former leader Tim Farron called on the party to "reclaim patriotism" from the far right in a theatrical display involving an England flag. The speech urged members to stop being "squeamish" about national flags and to wave them with pride, arguing they belong to everyone, not just nationalists who seek to divide. This new strategy aims to directly challenge parties like Reform UK, whose leader Nigel Farage the Lib Dems have dubbed a "plastic patriot."

          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a judge to prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue that public statements by officials, including the U.S. attorney general, and a highly publicized "perp walk" have prejudiced the case against their client. The defense claims the decision to seek capital punishment was politically motivated by the Trump administration's push to resume federal executions. This legal challenge follows a recent victory in state court where terrorism charges against Mangione were dismissed, though murder charges remain.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions requiring journalists to sign a pledge not to report on information that isn't officially authorized for release, including unclassified material. Failure to comply could result in the loss of press credentials, effectively preventing reporters from using unnamed military sources. The directive, issued by the newly renamed Department of War, also limits reporters' movements within the building, requiring official escorts in many areas. Press freedom advocates have condemned the move as a direct assault on independent journalism, arguing it allows the government to control the narrative about the military.</p>

The situation has drawn widespread criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, with some decrying "cancel culture" and others accusing the network of caving to political pressure.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., a resident of Leicester, North Carolina, is building his dream home from salvaged materials. John Saunby has been collecting debris from the storm's aftermath, such as porch posts and floorboards, that were otherwise destined for a landfill. He is using the found treasures, including tree trunks and rare Wormy Chestnut lumber, to construct a unique house with the help of his partner. The project represents a creative and resilient response to the destruction caused by the deadly hurricane that swept through the Appalachian Mountains last September.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses have advanced to their seventh consecutive Women's Rugby World Cup final after defeating France 35-17 in a hard-fought semi-final. Full-back Ellie Kildunne, returning from a concussion, was instrumental in the victory, scoring two decisive tries. Despite an early English lead, France remained competitive, trailing just 7-5 at halftime due to England's errors. The host nation improved in the second half, with tries from their dominant maul and forward pack creating a comfortable margin before a final score sealed the win. England will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Allianz Stadium.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people demonstrated in several German cities on Saturday, focusing on the separate issues of climate change and abortion rights. In Berlin, climate activists from Fridays for Future protested the government's energy policy and continued reliance on fossil fuels. Simultaneously, both anti-abortion and pro-choice groups held competing rallies in Berlin and Cologne. The "March for Life" demonstrations, which included prominent Catholic figures, were met by counter-protests advocating for sexual self-determination. The events highlight ongoing social and political debates within the country on key policy issues.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has repeated her call for a "national divorce" between red and blue states. In a social media post, she claimed without evidence that "millions on the left" celebrated Kirk's death and want conservatives dead. Political scientists warn that such a separation would not be peaceful, citing the American Civil War as a historical precedent for the violence that accompanies secessionist movements. Experts argue that despite deep political polarization, the solution is to find common ground rather than pursue a division that would likely trigger widespread conflict and instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary piece argues that the new, thinner iPhone Air is a symbol of a broader, undesirable trend toward minimalism in technology, design, and culture. The author contrasts the spartan aesthetic of modern products with the colorful, maximalist designs of the past, like the 1998 iMac, suggesting that today's "less is more" philosophy feels hollow and controlling. The article posits that this clean, unobtrusive design is deceptive, serving as a restrained-looking delivery device for the chaos of the digital world. This aesthetic, from interior design to theater, is presented as a manifestation of a world that feels increasingly out of control.</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old from Atlanta, moved to the Chiba Prefecture in Japan to teach English, seeking a change from the American school system and a higher cost of living. Her employer secured her a one-bedroom apartment for just 35,000 yen, or about $238 per month, within walking distance of her job. Smith has embraced life in the Japanese countryside, finding it cheaper and more respectful than city life, and documents her experiences on social media to show an alternative to the typical Tokyo-centric view of Japan. Despite enjoying her time, she plans to return to the U.S. after her one-year contract.</p>

          <p>Estonian military officials reported that three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated their airspace for 12 minutes, ignoring communication attempts from Italian F-35s that were part of NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission. Russia's Defense Ministry denied the incursion, but Estonia stated it was confirmed by radar and visual contact. The incident prompted Estonia to request formal consultations with NATO allies under Article 4 of its treaty. The event is the latest test of the alliance's eastern flank defenses, following a recent incident where Russian drones entered Polish airspace, and has heightened tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace, a major aviation technology provider, caused disruptions at several European airports, including those in London, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack targeted the company's MUSE software, which is used for passenger check-in, boarding pass printing, and baggage handling, forcing airports to revert to manual processes. This led to flight delays and some cancellations, with passengers reporting long queues. While the company is working to resolve the issue, cybersecurity experts noted that the incident highlights the vulnerability of the aviation industry's reliance on interconnected, third-party digital systems.</p>
