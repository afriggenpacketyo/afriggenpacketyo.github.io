          <p>Court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the fatal shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and the wounding of another and his wife, was a "prepper" with a "bailout plan" for his family. His wife informed investigators that they were preparing for catastrophic events and that Boelter instructed her to go to her mother's home in Wisconsin if necessary. Boelter is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, after impersonating an officer at their door. The investigation continues as police search for additional evidence, and the Hoffman family released a statement expressing concern about the risks public service entails. The author's tone is fairly neutral in relaying the facts of the story.</p>

          <p>A recent deadly border clash between Thailand and Cambodia has presented a challenge to China's diplomatic efforts to maintain stability in a region crucial to its strategic interests. Analysts suggest China will likely monitor the situation closely, possibly working with Asean to prevent further confrontations, while avoiding direct mediation. The skirmish, which occurred in the Emerald Triangle, has highlighted deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, an important trade gateway for China. This incident marks the second armed conflict in China's neighborhood within a month, raising concerns about Beijing's ability to foster regional ties amidst its rivalry with the United States.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, has been released on bail after being detained for over three months, with a federal judge ruling he is not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations against what his supporters claim is the Trump administration's crackdown on student protesters. The government argued that his activism impedes on US foreign policy and sought his deportation. Khalil criticized the administration for targeting him for protesting Israel's military actions in Gaza and expressed eagerness to reunite with his wife and son, whom he had limited contact with during his detention.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "Total and Complete Moron" for maintaining steady interest rates and suggesting he might fire him. Trump has been pushing for faster interest rate cuts, but it's unclear if he has the legal authority to remove Powell before his term ends in 2026. Powell has previously stated he would not resign if asked. Trump argues that Powell's policies are hindering economic growth, while the Fed remains cautious about lowering rates too quickly and potentially causing inflation to spike.</p>

          <p>The United States' recent failure to reach a tariff deal with Japan and threats to impose new duties on imports from other countries could embolden China in trade negotiations. Analysts suggest that these developments indicate weakness in Washington's negotiating position. President Trump had previously raised duties on Chinese imports and imposed tariffs on other Asian nations, but later put these measures on hold pending trade talks. The difficulties faced by the US in securing trade agreements may give China more leverage in future discussions.</p>

The Department of Energy ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain open beyond its closure date, and the administration is expected to prolong the life of the Monroe power plant.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles and delivered remarks, accusing California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent protesters. Vance also misidentified Senator Alex Padilla as "José Padilla." He defended the administration's response to the protests, stating that the National Guard was necessary to protect federal law enforcement. Padilla was forcibly removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference earlier this month.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Lime e-bikes have been found dumped in rivers and canals across England, raising concerns about pollution and flooding. The Canal and River Trust reports spending thousands of pounds retrieving the bikes, with Nottingham being a particular hotspot. Electric bikes pose a pollution risk due to substances in their batteries, and the Canal and River Trust has asked Lime to cover retrieval costs. Local groups and council members have been actively retrieving the bikes, and the Environment Agency is arranging a meeting with Lime to address the issue.</p>

Stylists suggest that tailored shorts are generally acceptable, but beach, sports, cargo, and denim shorts are not. A 2022 YouGov poll indicated that 66% of Britons found it acceptable for men to wear shorts in the office, a significant increase from 2016.</p>

Prior to his role in Reform UK, Yusuf was the CEO of Velocity Black, a luxury concierge business, where former employees reported similar issues with his behavior.

The judge ruled that American Oversight failed to prove the recordkeeping programs were inadequate or that the court could redress already-deleted messages.

The author sarcastically suggests that agents should avoid wearing anything that might indicate their official capacity, such as badges or uniforms. The piece humorously explores the idea that ICE agents should look like ordinary people, making it difficult for individuals to distinguish them from kidnappers or rogue criminals. The goal is to encourage agents to express themselves through clothing, as long as it doesn't reveal their official role.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines focus on the recent Commons vote backing a bill to allow some terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their lives, but emphasize the challenges it faces in the House of Lords. While some papers declare it a "victory" for campaigners, others highlight the "uphill battle" ahead, with peers promising an "attritional fight."
