          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly criticized Georgia's former Lt. Governor, Geoff Duncan, calling him a "total loser" after Duncan announced his switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Duncan, a vocal critic of Trump, explained his decision in an op-ed, citing policy disagreements and the political climate following the 2020 election. The Georgia GOP had previously expelled Duncan for endorsing Democratic candidates, and Trump's comments reflect the ongoing tensions within the Republican party over loyalty to his leadership.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order from the Trump administration has opened the door for 401k retirement plan managers to include private equity in their investment portfolios. This policy change introduces both potential benefits and significant risks for retirement savers, as private equity is typically associated with higher returns but also greater volatility and less transparency than traditional public market investments. The move could reshape retirement savings strategies, and this article explores the potential implications for Americans' long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to misidentifying a team of charity rowers off the coast of Norfolk as "illegal migrants," posting his concerns on social media and alerting authorities. After the crew was confirmed to be rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research, Lowe apologized for the false alarm. He subsequently pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity, while the rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious."</p>

          <p>As southern China, particularly the city of Foshan, grapples with a chikungunya fever outbreak, health experts are cautioning against broad mosquito elimination efforts. They argue that such measures are inefficient because the primary carrier of the virus in the region, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is relatively rare there. Instead, a more targeted approach focusing on the specific mosquito species transmitting the disease, Aedes albopictus, is recommended to effectively control the spread of the virus, which causes fever, rash, and joint pain.</p>

          <p>A Sky News journalist provides a personal reflection on interviewing Nicholas Rossi, the wanted American fugitive who posed as an Irish aristocrat named "Arthur Knight" while hiding in Scotland. The account details the inconsistencies and clues that undermined Rossi's charade, from his strange accent to his surprising knowledge of pop culture for someone who claimed to shun television. As Rossi now faces a sexual assault trial in Utah, the article looks back on the bizarre case of a man whose elaborate deceit was ultimately unraveled by his own digital footprint.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military operations by taking control of Gaza City, one of the last areas in the territory not under full Israeli ground occupation. The decision, made 23 months into the war, has drawn sharp criticism from international leaders and humanitarian organizations, who warn it will worsen the catastrophic situation for civilians. The plan also outlines five conditions for ending the war, including the release of hostages and establishing Israeli security control over a demilitarized Gaza.</p>

          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, has been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for conspiring to attack the power grid in Baltimore, Maryland. Prosecutors detailed how Russell and a co-conspirator planned the "sniper attacks" on electrical substations to incite societal collapse, particularly targeting a majority-Black city. The judge called Russell the "brains behind the operation" and imposed the maximum sentence, highlighting the government's focus on combating violent right-wing extremism.</p>

          <p>A leaked internal report has accused His Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) of a cover-up regarding a long-standing IT bug that caused evidence in civil, family, and tribunal cases to be lost or overwritten. Sources claim that for years, judges may have made rulings based on incomplete case files, yet management decided not to inform them, fearing it would "cause more harm than good." The situation has drawn comparisons to the Post Office Horizon scandal, with a former senior judge calling it "shocking" and a "scandal."</p>

          <h2>Perrier's "Natural Mineral Water" Status at Risk Amid Scandal Over Illicit Water Treatment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 00:58:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic French brand Perrier is at the center of a scandal that could strip it of its "natural mineral water" designation. Investigations revealed that Perrier and other companies have been illegally using treatments like micro-filtration, allegedly due to contamination concerns linked to climate change and drought. The issue is not public health, but rather that "natural" water is legally required to be unaltered. The controversy also involves accusations that the French government colluded with the industry to conceal the practice from the public.</p>
