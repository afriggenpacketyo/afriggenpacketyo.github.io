            <p>Donald Trump's stance on immigration reflects a preference for attracting wealthy individuals to the United States, aligning with the concept of selling citizenship or residency in exchange for investment.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court's order prevents the removal of Venezuelans from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice. The ACLU argued that the deportations would violate the migrants' rights to due process and legal representation. The Trump administration has defended its use of the Alien Enemies Act to detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. The optimism score is based on the court stepping in.</p>

            <p>Trump White House border czar Tom Homan defended the administration's decision to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, alleging that he is a violent MS-13 gang member and a public safety threat. Homan dismissed concerns about the Supreme Court's order to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return, claiming the administration lacks the authority to bring him back. He criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia and accused him of neglecting victims of MS-13 gang violence. The article highlights the Trump administration's unwavering stance on immigration enforcement and its focus on alleged gang affiliations.

            <p>British fighter jets intercepted Russian aircraft flying close to NATO airspace in two separate incidents this week. RAF Typhoons were scrambled to intercept a Russian intelligence aircraft over the Baltic Sea and another aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace. The intercepts were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing, working alongside Sweden. The UK's involvement in NATO's enhanced air policing is called Operation Chessman and sees personnel from across the RAF deployed to Malbork alongside Sweden, NATO's newest member.

            <p>A new study suggests that the Step Pyramid of Djoser in Egypt, the oldest of the monumental pyramids, was built using a hydraulic lift system. The research team believes that the pyramid's internal architecture and nearby waterways support the theory of a hydraulic-powered mechanism for moving the massive stone blocks. The study proposes that the Egyptians had a sophisticated understanding of hydraulic engineering much earlier than previously believed. The findings could change our understanding of ancient Egyptian construction techniques and technological advancements. The optimism score is based on finding out new facts about the past.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the reliability of various economic indicators, ranging from unusual metrics like lipstick sales to more conventional data such as consumer sentiment and GDP, in predicting a recession. The author argues that no single indicator is foolproof and that economists and pundits have often been wrong in their predictions. Instead, the author suggests focusing on actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital investment, and labor markets, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies, to gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's direction.

            <p>German authorities are seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens for allegedly participating in pro-Palestinian protests, sparking concerns about freedom of expression and due process.
