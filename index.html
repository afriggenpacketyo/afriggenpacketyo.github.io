          <p>A panga-style fishing boat capsized off the coast of San Diego, California, resulting in three deaths and at least seven people missing. The boat had at least 16 people on board, including two children, when it overturned near Torrey Pines State Beach. The US Coast Guard is treating the incident as a suspected human smuggling operation. Four people were hospitalized following the accident, and the search continues for any additional victims who may be in the water, amidst concerns about the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>

Woodbury, who had been dismissed from state service, faces a maximum sentence of two years in federal prison if convicted.

          <p>President Trump suggested reopening Alcatraz as a federal prison, sparking disbelief and criticism from tourists visiting the island. The New York Times article highlights that visitors found the idea impractical due to the prison's deteriorated condition, with broken toilets, crumbling walls, and the need to bring in all supplies by boat. Despite the Bureau of Prisons initiating an assessment, many officials and tourists view the proposal as absurd, given the island's historical significance and the high costs associated with operating a prison there. The article also notes that Alcatraz closed in 1963 due to high costs and security concerns.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks mounted a stunning comeback from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Boston Celtics 108-105 in overtime in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semi-finals series.

The Celtics struggled with their three-point shooting, missing a playoff-record 45 attempts, and Kristaps Porzingis played limited minutes due to illness, contributing to the Knicks' victory in a hard-fought contest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts from the Republican challenger to throw out thousands of votes, according to The New York Times. Judge Richard E. Myers II ruled that not counting all challenged ballots would violate the constitutional due process rights of those voters. The ruling is a victory for the Democratic incumbent, Justice Allison Riggs, and may bring closure to an election purgatory that has lasted nearly six months.</p>

          <p>The IRS has lost almost one-third of its tax auditors after two months of DOGE cuts, according to CBS News. The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in a significant number of revenue agents leaving the agency. This could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations. The cost-cutting efforts by DOGE may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, raising questions about the effectiveness of the initiative.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Education informed Harvard University that it was ending billions of dollars in research grants and other aid unless the school accedes to a list of demands from the Trump administration, according to The Guardian. The reason for the crackdown on Harvard is the school’s rejection of a long list of demands from the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce, prompted by campus protests against Israel’s brutal military campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023. McMahon also accuses the university of “a systematic pattern of violating federal law”.
