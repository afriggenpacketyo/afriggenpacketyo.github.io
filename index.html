            <p>A 38-year-old man, Cody Balmer, has been arrested and faces charges including attempted murder and arson after an overnight fire at the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence in Harrisburg. Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were home at the time and had to evacuate, but no one was injured. The suspect allegedly hopped a fence, evaded troopers, and used a homemade incendiary device to start the fire, causing significant damage to the residence. Authorities are investigating the motive, including the possibility that the attack was fueled by Shapiro's Jewish faith, as it occurred on the first night of Passover.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has finalized agreements with five law firms for pro bono work, totaling $600 million. This announcement comes as President Trump held a Cabinet meeting with top officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as Elon Musk. The meeting followed Trump's decision to pause higher tariffs for most countries for 90 days while increasing the rate against China to 145%. Republican leaders are also pushing through a budget blueprint to fund Trump's domestic agenda, despite opposition from some GOP members.</p>

            <p>A report by UK Members of Parliament (MPs) has revealed that some police forces were unprepared for the level of violence that erupted in riots following the murder of three children in Southport last summer. The disorder, which included attacks on hotels housing asylum seekers and mosques, resulted in 302 injured officers. The report acknowledged the bravery and professionalism of officers but noted that the inability of forces to act proactively left them exposed to significant risk. The report also addresses the role of misinformation spread online following the attack and calls for updated media protocols.</p>

            <p>Military planners have been called in to assist Birmingham, UK, in tackling the mounting piles of rubbish resulting from a month-long strike by refuse workers. Thousands of tonnes of uncollected rubbish line the city's streets, prompting the city council to declare a major incident and request assistance from neighboring authorities. While soldiers are not being deployed to collect rubbish, a small number of office-based military planners will provide logistical support. Striking workers are set to vote on a "partial deal" to end the strike on Monday, according to Unite.</p>

            <p>An American missionary, Robert Vieira, who was detained in Tunisia for over a year, has been released. Vieira was reportedly doing missionary work when he was detained by Tunisian authorities, who suspected him of espionage.

Vieira has since returned to the U.S. with his family, and Boehler credited the collaboration with Nafti for the successful resolution of the case.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering new tariffs on semiconductors, an essential component in many products, after recently lifting reciprocal tariffs on certain electronics. President Trump and Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett have stated that the administration is launching an investigation into semiconductors under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security concerns. This potential tariff follows the lifting of tariffs on electronics, including smartphones and computers, though a 20% tariff on Chinese technology related to fentanyl remains in place.</p>

He notes that China has been diversifying its markets and addressing its technology deficit in response to U.S. pressure.

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the US to completely cancel its "reciprocal tariffs" as the trade war between the two countries continues. This follows Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on global tariffs, while increasing levies on Chinese imports. However, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that exemptions for some electronic products would only be temporary, with plans for a separate "semiconductor tariff" to be announced later. The Chinese commerce ministry called the exemptions a "small step" but is evaluating the impact of the move.</p>
