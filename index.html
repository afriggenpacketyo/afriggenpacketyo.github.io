          <p>The Trump administration announced a 25% tariff on imports from India, but New Delhi has not rushed to secure a trade deal, prioritizing the protection of its agricultural sector. Indian officials stated that national interest comes first and that they will not be pressured by deadlines, expressing confidence in reaching a favorable agreement by late 2025. Analysts note that India's resistance stems from the relatively small role US exports play in its economy and its strategic importance to the U.S. as a counterbalance to China in global manufacturing and geopolitics.

          <p>Ford Motor Company has revised its forecast for the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion in the current year. This increase is attributed to prolonged higher duties on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Despite building most of its vehicles in the U.S., the company has already incurred an extra $800 million in duties in the last quarter. Ford executives are in communication with the White House to negotiate for lower tariffs on vehicle parts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal that sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, avoiding a threatened 25% rate. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for Korean companies entering the U.S. market, particularly in sectors like shipbuilding and semiconductors. While the deal lowers duties on key exports like autos, it excludes concessions on steel, aluminum, and copper, which face 50% tariffs. The agreement highlights the complex interpretations of investment profits and strategic negotiations amid broader U.S. trade policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has stated conditions for her testimony before a House committee. Her attorney informed the House Oversight Committee that she would only agree to a deposition if granted immunity from further prosecution or a presidential pardon, citing pending legal appeals. The committee has rejected the idea of granting immunity, insisting on proceeding with the scheduled deposition to inform legislative efforts against sex trafficking. Relatives of victim Virginia Giuffre have strongly opposed any leniency for Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a steep decline in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell to 4.7 trillion Korean won, missing analyst expectations. The downturn was driven by a massive 93.8% profit slump in its crucial chip division, attributed to inventory adjustments and impacts from China-related export restrictions. Despite the poor results, the company expressed optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, fueled by demand in AI and robotics. Samsung's mobile division, however, saw an increase in sales and profit, buoyed by its Galaxy smartphone series. (not investment advice)</p>

This "wobbler" provision was a compromise after initial concerns from some Democrats that a blanket felony charge could harm victims or be used to profile minorities.

          <p>A BBC analysis explores the multifaceted impact of the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policies on the U.S. and global economies. The average U.S. tariff rate has reached its highest point since 1934, significantly boosting government revenue but also contributing to a widening trade deficit as companies stockpiled imports. While Chinese exports to the U.S. have fallen, China has increased trade with other nations, and some countries are pursuing new trade deals to counteract the disruption. Economists warn that the tariffs are beginning to translate into higher consumer prices for Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. The decision came as new data showed the economy grew 3% in the second quarter, largely due to a drop in imports caused by tariffs, but underlying indicators suggest a loss of momentum. In an unusual move, two Fed board members dissented, favoring a rate cut, signaling a potential broadening of support for future reductions. The Fed remains cautious, balancing a stable job market against the uncertain economic effects of the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been arrested and charged with operating an illegal gambling business out of his Los Angeles-area home. Prosecutors allege that between 2021 and 2022, Arenas hosted high-stakes poker games, collecting a portion of each pot, and is charged alongside five other defendants. The indictment claims co-defendants hired women to serve players and armed security for the events. Arenas, who pleaded not guilty and was released on bond, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on all three federal charges.</p>

          <p>Following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast, this article explains the science of tsunamis. They are typically generated by strong, shallow, underwater earthquakes with vertical tectonic plate movement, which displaces a massive volume of water. In the deep ocean, the waves travel as fast as a jet but are often unnoticeably low; they slow down and grow dangerously high as they approach shallower coastal waters. Predicting their exact size and impact remains challenging, and experts stress the importance of heeding all evacuation warnings immediately, as even small-looking waves can carry immense destructive power.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has observed and documented abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The team discovered fields of tube worms, clam beds, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these "chemosynthetic" communities are more widespread than previously thought and offer new insights into adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing and complex debate about the effects of screen time on children, questioning the narrative that it is uniformly harmful. Some scientists argue that concrete evidence for negative outcomes is lacking and that many studies rely on flawed self-reporting data, failing to distinguish between different types of screen use. Others maintain that increased screen time correlates with rising depression rates and reduced sleep, advocating for parents to delay smartphone access. The piece highlights the lack of clear scientific consensus and official guidance, leaving parents to navigate a judgmental and uncertain landscape.</p>

The images revealed sophisticated and intricate designs of animals and mythical creatures that were not visible to the naked eye. The quality of the tattoos, which include leopards and a griffin, suggests advanced techniques and a significant cultural practice among the ancient nomadic people. By collaborating with a modern tattooist specializing in ancient methods, the team gained new insights into how these complex decorations were likely created.</p>
