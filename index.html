        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, secured the Romanian presidency after a politically turbulent period, defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion had initially won the first round, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race due to alleged Russian interference. Dan's victory with 53.6% of the vote was celebrated by supporters who desire profound change in Romania, while Simion conceded defeat after initially claiming victory. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, contrasting with Simion's anti-EU stance and calls to cut aid to Kyiv. Relevant context: The Romanian government had recently collapsed due to its candidate failing to reach the second round, highlighting the country's political instability.</p>

          <p>Professor Benjamin Horton, an earth scientist at City University of Hong Kong, views China as a leader in climate science due to its significant investments in green technology, reforestation, and environmental research. Horton contrasts China's proactive environmental stance with other countries that are reducing their environmental efforts. He chose to work in China because of its status as a superpower that is committed to environmental issues. Horton's previous role was at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, where he studied earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and climate change in Southeast Asia.

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered widespread sexual assault of children in South Africa's illegal mines, where criminal gangs exploit vulnerable individuals. Children, some trafficked from neighboring countries, are forced into labor and sexual assault, often in exchange for gold or protection. Miners describe witnessing the sexual assault of underage boys by adult miners, leading to trauma and trust issues for the victims. The investigation follows a police operation at the Buffelsfontein gold mine, which exposed the dire conditions and abuse faced by illegal miners, including children. The government has acknowledged the economic cost of illegal mining but has yet to address the sexual assault allegations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that domestic energy prices in the UK will decrease in July, reversing three consecutive increases in the regulator Ofgem's price cap. The annual bill for a typical household using gas and electricity is expected to fall by Â£129, a drop of nearly 7%. This change would result in a typical annual bill of Â£1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. The price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, meaning total bills still depend on usage.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice due to ample supply from supporters, amid soaring rice prices affecting households. Eto's comments, made during a fundraising event, contrasted with his ministry's efforts to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. Despite stabilization signs, average rice prices have doubled from last year due to poor harvests. Public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rice prices is high, impacting Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet's approval ratings. The government has been auctioning reserve rice to ease prices.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that China is outpacing the United States in key technological and economic sectors, potentially leading to a "Chinese century." The author contends that while the U.S. focuses on short-term trade disputes, China is making strategic investments in areas like AI, green technology, and manufacturing. China's approach involves substantial government funding for research and development, enabling it to compete effectively in industries ranging from electric vehicles to semiconductors. The author warns that the U.S. risks becoming a diminished nation if it continues to undermine its own innovation and global economic ties.</p>

          <p>House Republicans advanced their tax cut and border security package out of committee after negotiating with conservatives concerned about the bill's impact on the deficit. The bill permanently extends existing income tax cuts from Trump's first term and adds temporary new ones, while also increasing spending for border security and defense. Critics estimate the bill could add $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade. While some conservatives agreed to allow the bill to move forward, they continue to seek deeper spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid and clean energy programs. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the measure, labeling it a "betrayal."</p>

          <p>Smartex, a sustainable fashion startup, uses cameras, vision software, and AI to detect defects in textiles during production, aiming to reduce waste. The company claims to have prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years. Fashion's significant waste problem, with a truckload of clothes discarded every second, has prompted investors like H&M and Amazon to support Smartex. The startup's technology offers a solution to the industry's lack of digitalization and potential for efficiency, addressing both environmental and economic concerns.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles in an effort to save them from extinction. Water vole populations have declined by 90% in the past 30 years, prompting the need for innovative tracking methods. The glitter is mixed with apple chunks and fed to the voles, with the hope that it will appear in their droppings, allowing conservationists to monitor their movements and habitat use. This method aims to inform environmental adjustments, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing riverbanks, to support the voles' dispersal and survival.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists are investigating a mass grave of thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus dinosaurs in Alberta, Canada, to determine the cause of their sudden death 72 million years ago. The site, known as the "River of Death," contains an exceptionally dense collection of bones, with up to 300 bones per square meter. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were migrating together when a catastrophic flash flood swept through the area, killing the herd. The study of these fossils provides valuable insights into dinosaur biology and the ancient ecosystem.</p>

A bill in Congress to make Trump's tax cuts permanent could add trillions to federal debt. Moody's cited the legislation and broader fiscal deficit concerns in its downgrade. The move could shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, potentially increasing premiums for US debt.

The legislation would also cut Medicaid, food stamps, education and subsidies for clean energy, though they would not cover the entire cost of $3.8 trillion over 10 years.
