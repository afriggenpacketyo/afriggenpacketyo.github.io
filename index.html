          <p>The Bank of Korea has kept its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause initiated in May, as policymakers remain concerned about escalating household debt. This decision aligns with expectations and follows the implementation of stricter property measures across Seoul and surrounding Gyeonggi Province, aimed at curbing borrowing and housing demand. Analysts from Bank of America noted that Seoul's housing inflation has been a primary concern, hindering potential rate easing. The central bank also revised its 2025 inflation and GDP growth forecasts upwards, anticipating a modest domestic recovery despite potential trade uncertainties with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that her department is "not yet fit for purpose," acknowledging a "culture of defeatism" and systemic failures identified in an internal report. The report, commissioned in 2022, highlighted issues such as a lethargic asylum system with massive backlogs, outdated technology, and civil servants reluctant to work on immigration. Mahmood, who took office last month, committed to transforming the Home Office to improve its effectiveness and delivery for the country. This echoes a similar warning made two decades ago by a former Labour Home Secretary.</p>

          <p>The US State Department has eliminated its online Human Rights Reporting Gateway, the sole public channel for individuals and organizations to report alleged human rights violations by foreign military units receiving American arms. This move has drawn strong condemnation from human rights campaigners and a senior congressional aide who authored the law requiring such a channel. Critics argue the deletion signals a weakening of the department's human rights architecture and reduces incentives for foreign governments to address abuses. The State Department insists it continues to fulfill its legal requirements and engage with credible organizations on human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are making strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells" that can later spread the disease. A clinical trial, co-led by Dr. Angela DeMichele, successfully identified and attacked these lurking cells in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who had an aggressive form of breast cancer. After seven years, only two out of 51 women in the trial experienced recurrence, a rate significantly lower than expected. The team aims to expand these trials and explore the applicability of this approach to other cancers, offering new hope for long-term survival.</p>

          <p>Lebanon is facing the world's fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality, with new cases surging by 162% and deaths by 80% between 1990 and 2023. Key contributors include severe air pollution from vehicles and diesel generators, overuse of agricultural chemicals, and a pervasive smoking culture, which has led to a rise in lung, pancreatic, and liver cancers. Health education and early screening remain problematic, exacerbating the issue. Lawmakers have been presented with these findings and are beginning to consider public health campaigns and regulatory changes, though a slow implementation is expected.</p>

          <p>Oil prices surged by approximately 3% after the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the sanctions were a response to Moscow's "lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine" and aimed to reduce the Kremlin's revenue for funding the conflict. This marks a significant policy shift, with the US encouraging allies to join these measures. The move came amid falling oil prices earlier in the year and ongoing trade tensions.

          <p>A transport truck accidentally drove onto the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which is still under construction and not set to open until early 2026, from the US side last month. Canadian border services officers intercepted the truck before it reached the Canadian port of entry, confirming multiple security barriers prevented an erroneous crossing. No injuries occurred, and no weapons were drawn. The Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority stated all signs and GPS systems indicate the bridge's closure, emphasizing the integrity of security measures despite the driver's confusion on the complex construction site.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has chosen AeroVironment's Freedom Eagle-1 (FE-1) as its new counter-drone interceptor, primarily for defense against longer-range one-way attack drones and other uncrewed aerial systems. The FE-1, which recently completed key development milestones, is designed to be low-cost and versatile, with potential applications against subsonic cruise missiles. This selection addresses a critical short-range air defense gap within the Army, especially against threats like the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones. The interceptor's radar-agnostic design and cost-effectiveness aim to bolster air defense capabilities without straining existing resources.</p>

Dr. Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, confirmed the prevalence of such issues and the stigma surrounding them, which often leads to delayed diagnosis and inadequate support.
