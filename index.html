          <h2>Canada's Liberal Party Wins Election Amidst Trump's Annexation Threats and Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, secured a fourth term in Monday's federal election, a turnaround attributed to President Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose tariffs. Carney emphasized the end of Canada's long-standing integrated relationship with the United States, urging Canadians to look out for themselves. Voters expressed concerns about Canadian sovereignty, tariffs, and affordability, with many seeing Trump's decisions as globally impactful. The election saw a record number of Canadians casting their votes in advance, demonstrating the high stakes felt by the electorate in this pivotal moment for Canadian-American relations.

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following the emergence of a video where a band member seemingly called for violence against Conservative politicians. The group rejected any intention to incite violence, stating the footage was taken out of context. The controversy has led to calls for the group to be denied entry to the USA and Canada, with some politicians condemning their language as undermining values and inciting hate. The group has also faced scrutiny over alleged support for Hamas and Hezbollah, which they have denied, and has led to the withdrawal of government funding for the group.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is calling for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms, citing critical staff shortages among female radiographers specializing in breast screening. While some experts believe this could help with recruitment and open up the job to more qualified individuals, others express concerns about women's comfort levels with male staff performing such intimate screenings. Some politicians believe the focus should be on recruiting more radiographers rather than expecting women to compromise on their privacy and dignity. One woman who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer says that having a male radiographer wouldn't bother her at all.</p>

          <p>The government is considering extending the sugar tax, currently applied to fizzy drinks, to include pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, as well as non-dairy substitutes. This proposal aims to tackle obesity by incentivizing manufacturers to reduce sugar content in these beverages. Concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children, initially led to an exemption for milk-based drinks, but the Treasury now suggests the health benefits do not outweigh the harms from excess sugar. The government estimates that most soft drinks are not subject to the tax due to reformulation efforts since 2018, but the levy has created a clustering of products just below the 5g threshold.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a rapid shift towards authoritarianism, coupled with economic disruption and chaotic foreign policy. Critics argue that Trump's actions have undermined democratic institutions, targeted perceived enemies, and betrayed his own supporters. The President has imposed tariffs on trading partners including Mexico, Canada and China, with Chinese goods facing a combined tax of 145%. Despite promises of economic success, his policies have led to plummeting consumer confidence, stock market instability, and investor uncertainty, raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

The US's key foreign policy and national security making institutions are in crisis, with the Pentagon mid-meltdown under erratic leadership, while the state department is undergoing a vast shake-up.

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley anticipate that the US and China will engage in negotiations to gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports, although the disruptions have already caused significant damage to the economic cycle. While tariffs are unlikely to revert to pre-January 2025 levels, more comprehensive talks later in the year could lead to further reductions. Washington has imposed tariffs totaling 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far this year, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent. Given the damage already done to the economic cycle, Morgan Stanley said that the overall direction of growth was expected to remain downward. (not investment advice)</p>

The defining issue of the campaign was Trump's threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty, with Carney using it to his advantage.

The automaker is implementing a cost and cash action plan, including investment reductions and potential redundancies, and has withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026.

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a significant increase in first-quarter profits, driven by strong performance in its investment banking division, though credit provisions were increased amid uncertainties stemming from U.S. tariff policies. Net profit attributable to shareholders reached 1.775 billion euros, surpassing analyst expectations, while revenues rose by 10%. The lender's shares increased following the announcement. However, Citi analysts noted mixed divisional trends and highlighted the inclusion of a caveat for economic uncertainty in the lender's provision guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BP reported a weaker-than-expected first-quarter net profit, following a recent strategic reset and a slump in crude prices. The company posted underlying replacement cost profit of $1.38 billion, missing analyst expectations. BP's CEO, Murray Auchincloss, expressed optimism about the firm's strategic reset, despite activist investor pressure. BP's green strategy U-turn does not appear to have gone far enough for the likes of activist investor Elliott Management, which went public last week with a stake of more than 5% in the London-listed firm. Shares of BP fell 3.3% on Tuesday morning.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to form Canada's next government, marking an historic turnaround for a party that looked to be headed for collapse just months ago. But as results continue to be declared, the party has not secured a clear majority in parliament - meaning it may have to work to unite Canadians in the face of tariffs and threats from US President Donald Trump. The former banker presented himself during the campaign as the most experienced leader in a time of crisis. The vote share between the Liberals and the Conservatives looks close, indicating division in the country and a challenge for Carney as he looks to lead Canada through a trade war with the US.</p>

          <p>Electricity was restored to nearly all of Spain almost 18 hours after a blackout there and in neighboring Portugal. Spain’s national power company said early Tuesday that nearly all power had been restored in the country, mostly ending a major outage that affected airports, trains, traffic lights and other critical infrastructure. The cause of the outage, which stranded tens of millions of people on the Iberian Peninsula, remained unknown early Tuesday. Officials said there were no signs of foul play, such as a cyberattack.</p>

Trains stopped in the middle of a workday. And long lines formed at A.T.M.s and grocery stores, where credit card readers stopped working.

The city’s exports declined by 8.7 per cent in yuan terms over the quarter while China recorded a 6.9 per cent gain, the product of a last-minute trade scramble as firms locked in orders before US President Donald Trump’s rapid-fire tariff increases took effect.
