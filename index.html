          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:10:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information on the Jeffrey Epstein case she deems credible. This follows a Justice Department review which found no evidence of a "client list" and concluded Epstein's death was a suicide, sparking outrage among some of Trump's supporters. Trump deflected questions about his name appearing in the files, instead making baseless claims that political rivals created them. The situation has created a rift within his administration, with some allies calling for more transparency while Trump publicly defends Bondi's handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>The UK government secretly evacuated numerous Afghans after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked a dataset containing their personal details three years ago. This breach put thousands who had worked with British forces at risk of Taliban retribution. The government used a super-injunction to prevent media from reporting on the leak and the subsequent evacuation until now, raising questions about a potential cover-up. The incident highlights the life-threatening consequences of data mismanagement and challenges Britain's moral responsibility to protect its former allies.</p>

          <h2>Senate Republicans May Cut Billions from Foreign Aid and Public Broadcasting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:09:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans are poised to advance legislation that would cancel up to $9 billion in previously approved government funding. The proposed cuts, known as a rescissions package, target foreign aid programs and federal funding for public broadcasters like NPR and PBS. The move is being fast-tracked to meet a legal deadline, after which the administration would be forced to spend the money. While some moderate Republicans have raised concerns about cutting specific programs, such as the PEPFAR global AIDS initiative, the bill is being presented as a common-sense measure to reduce wasteful government spending.

          <p>Determining the best age to purchase an annuity depends heavily on individual financial goals, health, and risk tolerance, as there is no single correct answer. Generally, financial advisors suggest the optimal window is between 60 and 70 years old, as this balances higher payout rates with a reasonable income period. Buying a deferred annuity earlier, such as in one's 50s, allows more time for tax-deferred growth, while waiting until the late 60s or early 70s for an immediate annuity often yields the highest monthly payments. Ultimately, the decision requires a holistic review of one's retirement portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors is expanding its production of popular gasoline-powered vehicles by moving Cadillac Escalade manufacturing to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. The facility will also add production lines for the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to meet strong consumer demand. This move builds on GM's recent $4 billion investment in its U.S. facilities and represents a strategic shift for the Orion plant, which was previously expected to be dedicated exclusively to electric vehicles. The decision underscores the continued profitability and high demand for the automaker's traditional internal combustion engine models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Rev. John MacArthur, a prominent and influential evangelical pastor who led Grace Community Church in Los Angeles for over 50 years, has passed away at the age of 86. Known for his theologically conservative teachings and line-by-line expository preaching, his influence extended globally through his "Grace to You" broadcast ministry and numerous books. MacArthur gained national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for defying public health orders by holding large indoor services. He was a major figure in modern evangelicalism, lauded by followers for his steadfast interpretation of Scripture and unafraid of controversy.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee are demanding that Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel testify publicly regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The call comes after the Justice Department concluded Epstein's death was a suicide and that no client list exists, a finding that has caused a rift between President Trump and some of his supporters. Democrats argue that a public hearing is necessary to restore trust and scrutinize the administration's handling of the matter. They suggest the hearing could determine if there was a cover-up or if Trump magnified conspiracy theories for political gain.</p>

The batting collapse was attributed to a combination of a bowler-friendly pitch, the high quality of Australia's top-ranked team, and a fearsome spell from bowler Mitchell Starc. In response to the humiliation, Cricket West Indies has called an emergency meeting, inviting legendary former players like Sir Viv Richards and Brian Lara to provide recommendations.
