        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for leading a criminal enterprise while already imprisoned for a 1973 murder. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude for the commutation, stating that Hoover has spent nearly 30 years in solitary confinement and that the courts have been unwilling to consider his rehabilitation. It remains unclear when Hoover will be released from federal custody, as he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois for the 1973 murder.</p>

          <p>Canadian authorities ordered the culling of 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm after some birds contracted avian flu. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz have voiced opposition to the cull, suggesting further testing to understand the virus and relocating the birds to Oz's Florida ranch, respectively. However, most veterinarians argue that keeping potentially infected birds alive poses a public health risk, citing a U.S. outbreak that has killed millions of birds and infected dozens of people. The farm owners are contesting the order, proposing the ostriches be used for antibody research, while protesters have descended on the quarantined farm in support of the birds. Optimism score may be lower as the article deals with the culling of animals.</p>

          <p>President Trump's impatience and short attention span are undermining his administration and threatening the constitutional order, according to The Atlantic. His tendency to demand quick changes in policy and his frustration when things don't work rapidly have led to ill-tempered social-media posts, broadsides at policy makers, and premature declarations of victory. This impatience has resulted in collisions with the law and courts, as well as ineffective trade negotiations.

Shares of HP sank 15% after the report. The company stated that its outlook reflects the added cost driven by the current U.S. tariffs, along with associated mitigations. HP CEO Enrique Lores said that the company has increased production in Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mexico, and the U.S. to mitigate the trade-related costs (not investment advice).</p>
