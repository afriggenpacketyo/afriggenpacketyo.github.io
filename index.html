        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas is advancing Senate Bill 17, which seeks to prevent governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from acquiring land in the state, especially near critical infrastructure. Representative Cole Hefner emphasizes that the bill targets actions and affiliations, not race or nationality, and aims to protect Texans from foreign espionage. The bill empowers the state's attorney general to investigate and block land deals posing risks to public health or safety, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful residents, and is set to take effect September 1, with Hefner hoping it will spark a nationwide effort to secure the homeland.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most significant military conflict in decades, marked by aerial strikes and drone warfare, escalating tensions over Kashmir. Pakistan accused India of targeting its air bases with missiles and retaliated by striking Indian air bases and a missile storage site, prompting concerns from international bodies like the G7. The conflict, which began after a militant attack in India-controlled Kashmir, has led to civilian casualties and heightened fears among residents near the border. The article notes that the use of drones marks a new dimension in the conflict, and diplomatic efforts have so far failed to de-escalate the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, drawn by generous tax incentives like the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate, as well as lower labor costs. In 2024, 65% of UK production spending came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to £1.37 billion. President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries has caused concern in the industry, with some suggesting a federal tax incentive in the US to compete with the UK. The article highlights several films, including 'Barbie' and 'Indiana Jones,' that have utilized UK locations for filming.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will not be running for the Georgia Senate race next year, citing her unwillingness to fight for a team that refuses to win. Her decision follows Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's choice not to seek the Republican nomination, leaving the primary field open. Greene's polling numbers against Ossoff lagged behind Kemp's, with one poll showing Ossoff leading her 54%-37%. The Georgia seat is crucial for both parties' Senate ambitions, with Republicans aiming to oust Ossoff and Democrats seeking to maintain control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for undocumented migrants, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller argues that the U.S. faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants "invading" the country, justifying the potential suspension. Legal experts contend that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a president cannot do so unilaterally, with some citing historical precedents like Abraham Lincoln's actions during the Civil War to support this view. The article highlights concerns about the constitutionality and implications of such a move on due process.</p>

          <p>Financial ties between the U.S. and China are facing increasing strain due to declining mutual trust and escalating trade tensions.

The survey also examined the relationship between smartphone usage and loneliness, finding that those using smartphones for more than eight hours a day were more likely to report feeling lonely often. The most cited factor contributing to loneliness was bereavement of a family member, followed by living alone and serious health issues. The government is implementing measures to address loneliness and isolation through regional groups and public-private sector collaboration.</p>

          <p>Napo, the leading union for the probation service, is urging the government to make "bold investment decisions" to address the ongoing prison crisis. General Secretary Ian Lawrence supports proposals to reduce short sentences and strengthen community orders, but stresses that the probation service is already overworked. The union fears that cost-cutting measures could increase pressure on the service and undermine the effectiveness of sentencing reforms. The prisons and probation budget has fallen by 12% in real terms since 2007, and the Chancellor's plans for efficiency savings raise concerns about future funding.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan's recent military conflict, triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir, signals a dangerous shift in their rivalry, eliminating the diplomatic space for de-escalation. India, under Prime Minister Modi, views Pakistan as a threat to its rise, while Pakistan, despite its internal struggles, remains unwilling to back down on issues like Kashmir. This conflict has escalated beyond established guardrails, with India suspending a treaty on river sharing and Pakistan threatening to abandon a border agreement. The U.S.'s reduced role as a crisis manager exacerbates the situation, raising concerns about a potential nuclear escalation.</p>

          <p>A new study by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) warns that China's rapidly expanding nuclear power infrastructure could become prime targets in wartime. China's coastal nuclear plants, some in geopolitically sensitive areas, face evolving risks amid complex international environments. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has prompted Chinese military researchers to re-evaluate security risks and propose enhanced defenses for these facilities. The PLA study emphasizes the need for improved emergency response strategies to mitigate potential catastrophic consequences.</p>

          <p>Pakistan launched a military operation against India, targeting multiple bases including a missile storage site, after India fired missiles at three of its air bases. Pakistan's military said it used medium-range Fateh missiles to target an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in Pathankot and Udhampur. Tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals have escalated since an attack in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead. India conducted airstrikes on Pakistani territory, claiming they targeted militant-related sites, while Pakistan said it shot down five Indian fighter jets.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled that the U.S. may be open to lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff rate on Truth Social. This conciliatory tone comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. The two nations have been in a tense stand-off since Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with a 125% levy on American goods. Analysts suggest that a reduction below 80% could positively impact markets.</p>

The quarantine, effective through October 31, covers the California coastline from Oregon to the Mexican border. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be dangerous or fatal to humans. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to frequent testing, but officials caution against consuming clams and scallops without removing digestive organs.</p>
