          <p>HSBC has proposed a deal to take its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, private, valuing the Hong Kong lender at over $37 billion. The offer represents a significant premium over Hang Seng's recent average share price, causing its shares to surge nearly 30%. HSBC stated the move underscores its commitment to Hong Kong as a key financial hub and aims to unlock new growth opportunities for both banks. The privatization is seen by some analysts as a positive step to resolve governance issues associated with parent-subsidiary dual listings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's competition regulator has permitted five water companies in England to implement additional price hikes, affecting millions of households. The companies, including Anglian and Southern Water, successfully argued that the initial price caps set by Ofwat were insufficient to fund necessary infrastructure investments. While the Competition and Markets Authority granted only a fraction of the requested increase, the decision means bills will rise by an average of 3% more than previously planned. The move comes as water firms face pressure to upgrade aging systems responsible for pollution incidents.</p>

During a visit to Italy, Wang emphasized that cultural and institutional differences should not hinder cooperation, urging mutual respect for core interests. The diplomatic effort aims to bolster trade relationships with the G7 member as tensions persist between Beijing and the European Union. This comes as the EU recently proposed measures to protect its steel industry from what it describes as overcapacity originating from China.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, signaling a major step toward ending the war in Gaza. The agreement entails the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line. Following the announcement, the Israel Defense Forces began operational preparations to implement the ceasefire and adjust their deployment. Israeli President Isaac Herzog praised Trump's leadership, suggesting he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the negotiations.</p>

Achieving these wins would elevate their points total to ten, which could be enough to secure at least second place in their group. The outcome also depends on Greece's performance in their next matches, but a successful run for Scotland would put them in a commanding position.</p>

          <p>The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas marks a significant diplomatic breakthrough, largely attributed to the personal intervention of Donald Trump. While the first phase involves releasing hostages and withdrawing some troops, the article notes that crucial, unresolved issues could derail a permanent peace. Key challenges include the disarmament of Hamas, the future governance of Gaza, and political pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from his ultranationalist coalition partners. The agreement brings hope but does not guarantee an end to the two-year conflict, as both sides still have deep-seated suspicions and conflicting long-term goals.</p>

In response, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for scrapping the EU's planned 2035 ban on new combustion engine vehicles, a move some analysts believe could undermine consumer confidence.

          <h2>Italian Pasta Producers Fear Devastating Impact from Proposed US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Italian pasta makers are facing potential new U.S. tariffs of up to 92%, a move they fear could be a "fatal blow" to their exports. The threatened duties stem from a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation into alleged "dumping" practices, where goods are sold abroad at below-market prices. Major brands like La Molisana, Garofalo, and Barilla are targeted, which could cause prices for their products in the U.S. to double. Italian producers and government officials deny the accusations, viewing the tariffs as hyper-protectionist and are lobbying Washington to reverse the decision.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a disturbing trend of very young children, some only four years old, bringing knives and other sharp objects into primary schools in England and Wales. Police data from 2024 shows over 1,300 offenses involving blades on school premises, with incidents including a six-year-old with a flick knife and a five-year-old with a kitchen knife. In response to rising knife crime, some school trusts are installing permanent metal detectors. The mother of a teenager who was fatally stabbed at school is now calling for government funding to implement such security measures nationwide.</p>

          <p>Construction workers at the Port of Long Beach discovered a World War II-era explosive device, prompting an evacuation and response from multiple law enforcement agencies. The unexploded shell was found at one of the port's container terminals on Wednesday. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Bomb Squad and a U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team were called to the scene. After assessing the device, the ordnance team determined it was safe to transport, moved it off-site for deactivation, and normal port operations resumed later that evening.</p>

          <p>The recent Israel-Hamas agreement represents a significant diplomatic achievement for Donald Trump, who personally pressured both sides to reach a deal. The article argues that by making himself the face of the agreement, Trump has bound Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to it, leveraging their political alliance to compel cooperation. However, this first phase only addresses the hostage crisis and does not resolve underlying issues like Hamas's military presence or the future of Gaza's governance. While the momentum could lead to an end to the war, the path to a "durable and everlasting peace" remains fraught with challenges.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' 8-2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 3 of the NLDS is framed as a dangerous tactical failure that has given a struggling opponent new hope. The article argues that by failing to secure a sweep when they had every advantage, the Dodgers have shifted the series' momentum and now face a high-pressure Game 4. A loss on Thursday would send the series back to Philadelphia for a decisive Game 5, a scenario the Dodgers desperately wanted to avoid. The defeat saw key Phillies hitters regain their form while Dodgers pitchers Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Clayton Kershaw faltered.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies staved off elimination in the National League Division Series with an 8-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3. After the Dodgers took an early lead, a massive 455-foot home run by Kyle Schwarber in the fourth inning ignited the Phillies' offense and shifted the game's momentum. Dodgers' starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggled, allowing three runs, while the bullpen later conceded five more. The loss prevents a series sweep for the Dodgers, with the series now standing at 2-1 as it continues with Game 4 in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. embassy in China has announced that its social media accounts will not be regularly updated due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. A message posted on platforms like Weibo stated that updates would cease until full government operations resume, with exceptions for urgent safety and security information. The shutdown, which began after Congress failed to pass a funding bill, has furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal employees. The announcement on Chinese social media prompted thousands of comments, many of them ironically critiquing the American political system.</p>
