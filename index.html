          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived "lawlessness" in California, while Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and an overreach. Protests have erupted across L.A. County, with demonstrators blocking traffic and confronting federal agents, and the situation remains tense as local officials urge peaceful assembly while condemning violence. The deployment raises questions about federal overreach and the appropriate response to immigration-related unrest.</p>

          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, seeking relief from their trauma after struggling with traditional treatments. The retreat involved ceremonies with psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT, guided by traditional healers, with the goal of revisiting traumatic moments and finding new perspectives. While eight of the veterans reported improved symptoms and life-changing experiences, one veteran experienced a decline in mental health. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using MDMA and psilocybin to treat PTSD, signaling a potential shift in acceptance of psychedelic therapies, and research is underway to study the efficacy of psychedelics for PTSD.</p>

          <p>After over a year of escalating conflict with Israel, Hezbollah experienced significant losses, including the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and the crippling of its operatives through a Mossad operation involving explosive pagers. The events led to a ceasefire brokered by the United States and France, with the Lebanese government now required to regain control of southern Lebanon and prevent Hezbollah from conducting military operations against Israel. Analysts suggest that Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria have weakened Iran's proxy war strategy, forcing it to reconsider its approach to regional influence, and the organization's political power in Lebanon has diminished, though it remains a significant player.</p>

          <p>Former agents from Israel's Mossad detailed an elaborate operation involving the creation and sale of explosive pagers to Hezbollah militants. The operation, which started with weaponized walkie-talkies, culminated in the pager plot, where Mossad created booby-trapped pagers disguised as ordinary devices and sold them to Hezbollah, and the pagers were then remotely detonated, causing injuries and deaths among Hezbollah fighters. The agents explained that the goal was not only to kill militants but also to send a message of Israeli superiority and create fear within the organization, and the operation has had a profound impact, weakening Iran's regional influence and contributing to the fall of the Assad regime in Syria.</p>

          <p>British energy firms are being paid substantial sums to curtail power generation due to limitations in the electricity grid's capacity to transport renewable energy from remote areas, particularly wind farms in Scotland. Companies like Ocean Winds and Seagreen receive compensation payments when their output is restricted, while gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity, and this balancing act has cost the country over £500 million this year alone. The government is considering a radical solution involving regional electricity markets to improve efficiency and lower bills, but the proposal has sparked debate and raised concerns about potential cost increases for some consumers, and the situation calls into question the promise that net zero would deliver cheaper electricity.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is calling for 200,000 new blood donors to address a challenging blood shortage, with supplies remaining low and officials warning of a critical need for more donors with O negative blood. The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase the number of regular donors to over one million to maintain a safe and reliable supply, and the appeal comes after the NHS issued an amber alert last year due to low blood stocks. The NHSBT is also stressing the need for more black donors, as they are more likely to have specific blood types that can help treat people with sickle cell disease, highlighting the importance of diverse donor participation.</p>

The local authority has refused to reveal when concerns were first raised or if an internal investigation will be carried out, leading to calls for accountability and improved support for families raising safeguarding issues, and the case has prompted scrutiny of Solihull Council's efforts to protect children following previous high-profile incidents.</p>

          <p>BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are intensifying competition in Europe's small car market, challenging established automakers like Volkswagen and Renault. BYD launched its Dolphin Surf compact hatchback in Europe, priced competitively with a range of €22,990 to €24,990, and the company is exploring the small car segment in Europe, signaling a significant move. The introduction of affordable Chinese EVs presents an opportunity for European consumers but also poses a challenge to European carmakers struggling to produce competitive small cars, and the shift could reshape the landscape of the European automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing immigration raids in Southern California, federal officials have vowed to continue enforcement efforts in Los Angeles, prompting concerns about how to handle interactions with federal agents. Experts advise individuals to remain silent, refuse to answer questions, and decline to sign documents if approached by ICE agents, and they also recommend having a Red Card that explains these rights. Employers are advised to create a response plan for ICE visits, ensuring employees know their rights and designating authorized speakers, and the raids have sparked protests and raised questions about the balance between immigration enforcement and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. Gandhi's government quietly began reimagining the country as a centralised state governed by command and control, and top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system. The push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy, even if it never fully materialised, and the idea was inspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France.</p>
