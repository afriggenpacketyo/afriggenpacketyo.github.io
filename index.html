          <p>A joint investigation by NPR and PBS Frontline reveals systemic failures in how communities rebuild after disasters, despite the federal government spending billions annually. The investigation focuses on communities impacted by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, as well as Houston, New York, and New Jersey, finding that rebuilding efforts often fail to adequately protect against future disasters. Powerful forces, including private developers, undermine safer building practices, leaving communities vulnerable. The report highlights the tension between immediate economic needs and long-term resilience, with some officials prioritizing jobs and visitors over strengthened building codes, and also the complexity of balancing property rights with community safety. </p>

          <p>A major exhibition in Trier, Germany, explores the enduring relevance of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his Stoic philosophy, particularly his book "Meditations." The exhibition delves into themes of good governance, wisdom, justice, prudence, and moderation, highlighting their importance in times of crisis and polarization. Marcus Aurelius, who ruled during a period of war and plague, emphasized equanimity and acting for the common good, offering insights that continue to resonate today. The exhibition aims to inspire reflection on leadership, society, and the timeless wisdom of the philosopher-king, though the article notes that Marcus Aurelius's views were limited by the social structures of his time.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that corruption has become pervasive in America, eroding the political system and transforming it into one that serves the interests of a strongman rather than the people. The author draws parallels between the current state of American politics and the corrupt systems established by leaders like Vladimir Putin in Russia and Viktor Orban in Hungary. The piece emphasizes the dangers of merging political and personal interests, weakening checks and balances, and eroding ethical frameworks. The article suggests that the United States risks becoming another country where power is personalized and used for personal profit.</p>

          <p>Rwanda has announced its withdrawal from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) due to ongoing tensions with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The decision follows Rwanda being blocked from assuming the rotating presidency of the bloc, which Kigali viewed as a violation of its rights. Rwanda condemned the DRC's "instrumentalization" of the bloc, citing that it sees "no justification for remaining in an organization whose current functioning runs counter to its founding principles." This action underscores the escalating conflict between Rwanda and the DRC, fueled by the presence of the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group in eastern Congo.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after being ingested. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics alter gut metabolism and damage the gut barrier in mice. The study suggests that this could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. The widespread use of PLA in food packaging and disposable tableware has led to increased oral exposure to these microplastics.</p>

The workshop, dating back to the Classical period, contained new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items. Excavators also found unfinished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. The site, reorganized in the late third century B.C., served as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, providing insight into ancient artistic practices.</p>

          <p>Nearly six decades after humans first walked on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are aiming to return, driven by the moon's rich resources and its potential as a gateway to Mars. The Artemis program, led by NASA, aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole and launch a new space station into lunar orbit. China and Russia also plan to build a moon base called the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. These missions aim to extract resources like iron, silicon, hydrogen, and helium-3, and conduct scientific research to benefit both lunar exploration and life on Earth.</p>
