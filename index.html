          <p>Chinese officials have pledged to tackle the persistent issue of oversupply and "disorderly low-price competition" within its massive solar photovoltaic industry. In meetings with industry leaders, the government emphasized the need to govern the sector according to regulations, improve product quality, and phase out outdated production capacity. This renewed commitment follows President Xi Jinping's recent call to remove excess industrial capacity, aiming to foster healthier and more sustainable development for China's globally dominant solar market. The move seeks to stabilize an industry facing internal challenges while continuing its global expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi warns that Iran's government is intensifying its repression of citizens, particularly activists, in the wake of its recent conflict with Israel. In a message from Tehran, she states the regime is leveraging the war to deflect from internal failures and "spread fear and terror," leading to a surge in executions and arrests. Mohammadi describes extremely harsh conditions for political prisoners transferred from Evin Prison after it was struck by Israel. She calls for renewed international attention on the country's worsening human rights situation.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group seized power in 2021. The announcement followed a meeting in Kabul between Afghanistan's Foreign Minister and the Russian ambassador. Russia's foreign ministry stated the move will boost bilateral cooperation, including efforts to combat terrorism and drug trafficking. This decision, which comes after Moscow removed the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations, has drawn criticism over concerns that strategic interests are being prioritized over human rights.</p>

The incident occurred as a crowd was leaving an album release party, when occupants of a dark vehicle opened fire. Police Superintendent Larry Snelling described the attack as calculated, noting the perpetrators "didn't care who was struck." While no arrests have been made, authorities believe three shooters were involved and are preparing for potential retaliation, increasing police presence across the city.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 White House bid. His visit will focus on economically challenged and environmentally vulnerable counties, with the state's Democratic Party chair framing it as an effort to show these voters they are not forgotten. Although a political advisor denies the trip is about a presidential run, Newsom's itinerary includes several red counties. This follows other recent overtures to Southern voters, including a debate with Florida's governor.</p>

In addition to the fee hike, the order calls for U.S. residents to receive "preferential treatment" in park access systems like lotteries or permitting.

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed the Trump administration's signature legislative package in a narrow 218-214 vote, sending the massive bill to the president's desk. Dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," it includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts, extends tax reductions from Trump's first term, and significantly increases funding for defense and immigration enforcement. The passage followed a marathon overnight session where Republican leaders overcame internal opposition to the measure. The nonpartisan CBO estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

The team was returning from a European Cup match in Yugoslavia when their plane crashed during a refueling stop in Munich. The memorial serves as a poignant show of respect, reminding visitors of one of football's darkest days and the lives lost in the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has placed 139 employees on paid administrative leave after they signed a "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's direction under the Trump administration. The employees' letter argued the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment. In response, the EPA accused the signatories of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for such actions. The move represents a rare public clash between career staff and political leadership over the agency's rollback of environmental regulations.</p>

The committee accused the Home Office of showing "little curiosity" about the system's operation and being "slow and ineffective" in tackling the exploitation of workers.

The injury occurred during a game when a runner slid into his knee on an attempted steal. While Muncy initially feared a more severe injury, an MRI revealed no structural damage, which he described as the "best-case scenario." His absence creates a significant gap in the Dodgers' lineup, as he was a key offensive contributor, leading the team in average and RBIs in June.</p>
