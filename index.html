          <p>Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, stated that the Trump administration is exploring the option of suspending habeas corpus in cases related to illegal immigration. Miller argued that the Constitution allows for such suspension during times of invasion, a justification being considered in response to challenges against the planned deportation of undocumented immigrants. This statement has sparked controversy and legal debate regarding the extent of executive power and constitutional rights in immigration enforcement. The administration's active consideration of this measure signals a potentially significant shift in immigration policy and enforcement strategies, raising concerns about due process and individual liberties.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), was fired by President Trump after voting against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. Trumka contends that DOGE's involvement would compromise product safety standards. Consumer Reports condemned the firing, arguing it undermines the independence of the CPSC. Trumka has vowed to challenge his dismissal in court, citing concerns that the administration seeks to weaken the agency to benefit wealthy donors, and the article notes that DOGE has faced scrutiny for reversed firings and questionable cost savings.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a court ruling that favored the game maker in a contempt ruling.

Apple is appealing the ruling and could still reject the submission.

          <p>Affirm shares experienced a significant drop after the fintech company issued a weak revenue forecast, raising investor concerns about CEO Max Levchin's strategy of focusing on 0% loans. The company's revenue projection fell short of analyst expectations, and Levchin's plan to use 0% loans to attract customers and build loyalty has been met with skepticism. While these loans now constitute 13% of Affirm's Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), the company's core business remains point-of-sale installment loans for various consumer goods. The article notes that the company is trying to take market share from credit cards.</p>

          <p>Tech giants like Meta and Alphabet reported strong first-quarter ad sales, but executives are expressing caution about the rest of the year due to President Trump's tariffs and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Meta noted reduced spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, while Snap pulled its second-quarter guidance. The digital advertising market is showing signs of vulnerability as companies anticipate shrinking corporate ad budgets. Despite the initial strong performance, the looming economic storm from trade wars is casting a shadow over the industry's outlook.</p>

These approaches allow investors to acquire gold at lower entry prices, making it more accessible and affordable.
