          <p>With record high rice prices in Japan, supermarket chains are increasing sales of foreign-grown rice to offer consumers more affordable options.

Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high due to a poor harvest in 2023.</p>

The approval of Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel by Trump is viewed as a symbolic development. Japan continues to push for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the U.S.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, have left Paul Weiss after the firm made a controversial agreement with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The departures follow an executive order that sharply limited the firm's interactions with the government due to its employment of Mark Pomerantz, who investigated Trump. The order was rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises, sparking debate within the legal community.

          <p>Satellite imagery has revealed the mangled remains of a North Korean naval destroyer damaged during a failed launch ceremony, reportedly causing distress to Kim Jong Un. The ship is shown twisted and partially submerged in the port of Chongjin, covered by a blue tarp. Kim Jong Un blamed military officials and shipyard operators for the incident, demanding repairs be completed before the communist Working Party's meeting in June. The incident highlights North Korea's focus on military weapons development.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are raising concerns about the impact of cuts to weather balloon sites by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), noting a decline in forecasting accuracy. The reduction of balloon sites has created gaps in critical data, affecting the ability to predict severe weather events, such as ice storms and tornadoes. Meteorologists emphasize the irreplaceable nature of weather balloon data, which cannot be adequately substituted by satellites or radar. An NOAA spokesperson defended NWS forecasting, but some meteorologists say they have no choice but to make do with new limitations.</p>
