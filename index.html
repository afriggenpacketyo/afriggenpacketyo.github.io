          <p>Oil giant BP announced a 49% drop in first-quarter profit, reporting $1.38 billion compared to $2.7 billion the previous year, falling short of analyst expectations. This decline follows a recent strategic reset where BP pledged to increase spending on oil and gas while cutting back on renewable energy investments to rebuild investor confidence. Despite pressure from activist investors like Elliott Management, who have acquired a substantial stake, BP faces ongoing shareholder frustration, as evidenced by a significant vote against the re-election of its outgoing chair at the annual general meeting. The company is navigating a complex landscape of investor demands and fluctuating energy prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Food delivery service Deliveroo is preparing to be taken over by US rival DoorDash, marking a disappointing end to its time on the stock market. The company's share price has never recovered from its initial slump after being mis-priced at its initial public offering. Deliveroo's lightweight board are preparing to take the easy way out of its disastrous stint on the stock market. Accepting a low-ball, opportunistic takeover bid from US rival DoorDash is a pretty clear admission that Deliveroo’s brief time as a quoted company has been a massive failure.</p>
