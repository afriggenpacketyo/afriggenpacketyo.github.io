          <p>Monday's UK newspaper front pages highlighted Sir Keir Starmer's strategic defense review, with varying perspectives on its feasibility. The i Paper emphasized the creation of 12 new attack submarines to support 30,000 jobs, while the Telegraph criticized the defense secretary for allegedly backtracking on a commitment to increase military spending to 3% of GDP by 2034. Several papers also focused on the increasing number of migrants crossing the English Channel, quoting the defense secretary's description of smugglers running a 'taxi' service. The Guardian highlighted a trial suggesting exercise is more effective than drugs in preventing cancer recurrence. This article provides an overview of the main topics covered by various UK newspapers, reflecting a range of political and social issues.</p>

          <p>Unofficial results indicate that right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki is poised to become Poland's next president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. The projected win represents a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. If confirmed, Nawrocki is expected to utilize his veto power to impede Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, potentially revitalizing the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition. His presidency would likely champion traditional Catholic values and Polish sovereignty within the EU, while also supporting continued aid to Ukraine but opposing its NATO and EU membership during the ongoing conflict with Russia. This article analyzes the potential implications of the election outcome on Polish politics and its relationship with the EU.</p>

          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, leading to a surge in both companies' stock prices. The merger will establish a new Sydney-listed company acquiring all outstanding shares of both firms, creating an entity with approximately $9 billion in value and holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The deal aims to simplify the existing structure, increase scale, and enhance the company's investment appeal, while also unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers. The merger is expected to provide Brickworks shareholders with an implied value of A$30.28 per share, representing a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday.</p>

          <p>The convergence of China's Dragon Boat Festival and Children's Day led to a surge in domestic tourism bookings, particularly for campsites and amusement parks. Short-haul domestic travel bookings increased by 23% year-on-year, driven by summer escapes and family-friendly activities. Bookings for theme park tickets grew by over 100% compared to the previous year's Dragon Boat Festival weekend, while campsite bookings rose by 80%. This trend reflects a growing interest in domestic travel, cultural experiences, and family-oriented activities among Chinese consumers, as officials look to tourism as a driver of support for the nation’s service sector.</p>

The Trump administration's export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, along with visa revocations for Chinese students, have drawn criticism from Beijing. China's commerce department stated these actions "seriously undermine" the Geneva agreement and vowed to protect its interests if the U.S. continues actions that "damage China's interests."

          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national attending the University of Michigan, fled the U.S. after being charged with voting illegally in the 2024 general election. Despite a court order to surrender his Chinese passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. The FBI has charged Gao with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The case is among a small number of instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections.</p>

          <h2>Military Veteran Campaigns for Pension Correction</h2>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, continues his decades-long campaign to correct what he believes is a "robbery" of his military pension. Williams, who served for 18 years, discovered that a change in pension rules shortly after his discharge resulted in a significantly lower pension compared to colleagues with similar service records. Despite numerous appeals, the Ministry of Defence maintains that his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time of his discharge. Williams hopes that by sharing his story, he can raise awareness and potentially find other affected veterans.</p>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service is deploying resources to assist in the firefighting efforts.
