          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford recently participated in an extensive passing workout, his first since being sidelined with a back issue. Coach Sean McVay expressed optimism, stating Stafford "looked good" and threw over 60 passes without apparent limitations, marking a significant step in his recovery. The 37-year-old veteran is dealing with an aggravated disc issue and is expected to gradually rejoin team practices. This positive development is a hopeful sign for the Rams as they prepare for the upcoming season, aiming to have their star quarterback back in action soon.</p>

          <p>During the Dallas Cowboys' preseason game, star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, who was not playing, was inadvertently leveled by a sprinting field official. Lamb was standing on the sideline in street clothes when the official, focused on the play, ran into his back, knocking him down. Although Lamb was uninjured and laughed off the incident, the Cowboys received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for a non-player making contact with an official. The unusual event occurred during the second quarter of the game against the Los Angeles Rams.</p>

          <p>The 2022 death of Minnesota nurse Alex Pennig, initially presented as a suicide by her ex-boyfriend Matthew Ecker, was later ruled a murder following a detailed investigation. Ecker claimed Pennig shot herself in a locked bathroom, but detectives found critical inconsistencies in his story. A key piece of evidence, a broken part of the door lock found under her body, suggested the door was forced open before the shot was fired. Ecker was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison for the crime.</p>

          <p>Baseball Hall of Famer Mariano Rivera sustained a torn achilles tendon during the New York Yankees’ Old-Timers’ Day game on Saturday. The 55-year-old legendary closer was injured while moving to field a fly ball and will require surgery. This injury is reminiscent of his 2012 season-ending ACL tear, which also occurred during pre-game activities. Rivera, who holds the all-time record for career saves, had been enjoying the event, even getting a single in his at-bat before the unfortunate injury occurred, casting a pall over the celebratory day.</p>

The situation has been exacerbated by global trade disputes, with retaliatory tariffs from the EU and a halt on imports in Canada threatening a key export market.

          <p>A new adaptation of "War of the Worlds" starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% initial score on Rotten Tomatoes. However, the overwhelmingly negative reception has ironically generated interest, drawing viewers who are intrigued by "junk films" that are so bad they become entertaining. The article explores the appeal of such movies, contrasting them with forgettable, bland blockbusters. Experts and fans argue there is a certain charm in watching earnest but failed filmmaking, which can be more memorable and enjoyable than a polished but soulless production.</p>

          <p>The release of China's DeepSeek-R1 AI model six months ago sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley, challenging the "bigger is better" philosophy of AI development. DeepSeek demonstrated that a highly capable model could be built with a fraction of the resources, prompting a shift toward developing smaller, more efficient AI. Despite security concerns about its Chinese origins, some U.S. startups continue to use the model to cut costs. The event marked a turning point in the U.S.-China AI rivalry, proving the competitiveness of China's tech sector and influencing subsequent strategies from major players.</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying himself, was reportedly motivated by a belief that the COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal.

The attack has drawn renewed attention to the climate of hostility toward public health institutions, with critics blaming anti-vaccine rhetoric for fueling such violence.

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following controversy over a sandal design for Adidas that Mexican officials called cultural appropriation. The government of Oaxaca state complained that the "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe reinterpreted a traditional huarache sandal unique to the region without collaborating with or compensating the local Indigenous community. In response to the backlash and a demand for compensation from the Mexican government, Chavarria expressed deep regret. Adidas has also stated it recognizes the criticism and is seeking to repair the damage.</p>

Supporters intentionally violated the new law, which criminalizes public support for the organization, by displaying signs with the group's name outside the Houses of Parliament. The ban followed an incident where activists vandalized military planes to protest UK support for Israel. Protest organizers aimed to overwhelm the justice system to challenge the law's legitimacy, which they argue illegally restricts freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The recent attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's atomic bomb commemorations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time marks a delicate test for improving China-Japan relations. Lee Yi-yang, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan, was present at the ceremonies, part of a broader effort by Taipei to strengthen unofficial ties and raise its international profile. While Beijing is expected to view the participation negatively, observers believe both China and Japan will act cautiously to avoid derailing their recent diplomatic progress.
