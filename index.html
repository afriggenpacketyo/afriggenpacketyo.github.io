            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite objections from the District Attorney's office. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are seeking a reduced sentence that could make them eligible for parole. The District Attorney argued that the brothers have not fully taken responsibility for their crimes, while the defense argued that they have rehabilitated themselves in prison. The judge emphasized the importance of maintaining consistency, allowing the hearing to continue next week.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump stated he "got every answer right" on a cognitive test taken during his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He also mentioned that the exam showed a "good heart, a good soul, very good soul," and that the full report would be released soon. This is the first physical exam of his second term, and he boarded Air Force One shortly after for Florida. The White House press secretary indicated that the president's physician would provide an update on the report with as many results as possible in the interest of transparency.</p>

            <p>California has defied a Trump administration order to certify that all school districts have eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, arguing that such programs are legal under state and federal law.

California officials argue that the federal request is vague and that school districts already affirm compliance with federal law.

            <p>The Trump administration has decided to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans in the U.S., potentially leading to their deportation starting May 20. The Department of Homeland Security Secretary determined that Afghanistan no longer meets the requirements for TPS designation. This decision reverses the Biden administration's previous extensions of TPS for Afghans due to the ongoing conflict and instability in the country. Advocates argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened and that this decision undermines America's commitment to its allies.</p>

This is the second time the state has used this method in five weeks, making it only the fourth firing squad execution in the U.S. since 1976. Mahdi chose the firing squad over lethal injection or the electric chair. He was convicted of killing James Myers in 2004, as well as Christopher Boggs in North Carolina. Mahdi's execution is the fifth in South Carolina since September, marking a resumption of executions after a 13-year pause.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must try to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. A lower court ordered the administration to "facilitate" Garcia's return, but the Supreme Court also said the judge may have exceeded her authority. Garcia, allegedly a gang member, was deported due to an "administrative error" and is now being held in a notorious Salvadoran prison. The judge has ordered the administration to provide daily updates on their efforts to bring him back.</p>

            <p>Michael Angarano's "Sacramento" is a bittersweet comedy exploring male friendship and the challenges of adulthood. The film follows Rickey (Angarano) and Glenn (Michael Cera), two old friends who embark on a road trip. The movie examines the eccentric clash of priorities and temperaments as they confront the weight of responsibility. Maya Erskine's character brings a dose of sincerity that helps the film reach a believably offbeat conclusion.</p>

            <p>The UK government is preparing to take control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe to prevent its imminent closure. Parliament is reconvening to pass emergency legislation that would keep the Chinese-owned site operational. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is losing £700,000 a day despite significant investment. The government's intervention stops short of nationalization but aims to protect the UK's steel industry.</p>

            <p>Rafael Osío Cabrices's book, "Venezuela. Memorias de un Futuro Perdido," explores the events leading to Venezuela's socioeconomic crisis and the lost hope for the future. The book argues that people are not aware of what democracy means and why it is important to preserve it. While acknowledging differences between Venezuela and the U.S., the author suggests that Venezuela's case serves as a warning about how a society can make wrong decisions and destroy what it has built. He emphasizes that democracy should not be taken for granted.</p>
