          <p>Russia announced that another 307 prisoners of war were exchanged with Ukraine, marking the second day of a significant exchange. This follows a previous exchange where both sides handed over 390 POWs, as confirmed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Defense Ministry. These exchanges, while positive, come amidst ongoing conflict and highlight the continued efforts to secure the release of captured soldiers. The exchanges follow bilateral peace talks in Istanbul last week, where the exchange was prepared.

          <p>President Donald Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point amidst ongoing changes to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. These changes, influenced by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, include disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books on diversity, race, and gender issues from academy libraries. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue that these actions undermine the educational value of engaging with diverse ideas.

          <p>Experts are working to save Florida's coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a resilient species, in an effort to combat the severe decline in coral cover. The Florida Keys have lost 90% of their healthy coral cover due to climate change, prompting this large-scale restoration project. Marine biologists from the Keys Marine Laboratory and the Florida Aquarium are partnering to cultivate genetically diverse corals that are more resistant to environmental stressors. The project aims to reintroduce these corals to designated offshore sites, monitor their progress, and gather insights for future reef recovery efforts.

          <p>A commentary argues that efforts to revitalize downtown areas are undermined by rising homelessness, exacerbated by budget cuts to safety net programs. The author contends that economic revitalization cannot occur without addressing the needs of the unhoused population. Assemblymember Matt Haney is spearheading initiatives in California to address homelessness as a key component of downtown recovery. The author emphasizes that providing shelter and support for the homeless is essential for creating safer and more economically viable urban centers. The lack of proper support to the homeless is a massive detriment to society.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Link Tooth Sensitivity to Ancient Armored Fish</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Yara Haridy, an evolutionary biologist, discovered that structures in these ancient fish, initially thought to be early vertebrate scales, share similarities with vertebrate teeth. This finding indicates that the ability to sense pressure and temperature, now experienced as tooth sensitivity, evolved from these ancient sensing structures. The research highlights the evolutionary connection between ancient organisms and modern human physiology, offering insights into why we experience toothaches.</p>

The Duke of Sussex feels his family's security was lessened after he stepped back from working royal duties, but any likelihood of him reviving the legal battle over his personal security arrangements is narrowing by the day.
