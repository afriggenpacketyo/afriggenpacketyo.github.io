          <p>Frank Bruni's New York Times article delves into the internal conflicts within the MAGA movement, focusing on Laura Loomer's discontent with various figures, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Pam Bondi. Bruni argues that Trump's tendency to align with those who prioritize provocation over substance poses a risk to his political future, suggesting that such alliances can lead to chaos and hinder effective governance. Loomer's influence and attacks on Trump's designees and associates highlight the fractures within the movement, revealing that Trump's supporters are not a monolithic group and that their discord could undermine his political agenda. The article suggests that Trump's reliance on divisive figures may backfire as the infighting intensifies. Optimism is low given the contentiousness described.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, David Brooks explores the pervasive sense of rejection experienced by young adults today, particularly those attending elite universities. He notes the intense competition for college admissions, internships, and even student clubs, leading to a culture of constant evaluation and exclusion. Brooks argues that this environment fosters anxiety, a need for impression management, and a tendency to prioritize security over exploration. He suggests that the overproduction of elites and the ease of online applications have exacerbated the problem, leaving many young people feeling inadequate and disillusioned, even after achieving academic success. The article conveys a sense of concern about the psychological impact of this hypercompetitive landscape on young people.</p>

          <p>Cava, a Mediterranean restaurant chain, reported better-than-expected sales and same-store sales growth of 10.8%, defying the broader restaurant industry's challenges. The company attributed its success to increased traffic and premium purchases, with diners trading up from fast food and down from casual dining. Despite its strong performance, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% for the fiscal year, but it did raise its adjusted EBITDA projections and plans to open more new locations.

          <p>Florida has become the second state to ban the addition of fluoride to drinking water, following a bill signed by Governor Ron DeSantis. The law goes against the advice of public health experts and medical professionals, who warn it will increase tooth decay, especially in children. DeSantis justified the ban as protecting against forced medication, arguing individuals should have the choice to use fluoride through toothpaste and mouthwash. The decision aligns with the views of Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Florida's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, who have raised concerns about fluoride's impact on intellectual abilities, despite the CDC's stance on its benefits for dental health.</p>

The article suggests that the United States is shifting its regulatory approach under President Trump, with the FDIC and Federal Reserve easing restrictions on banks handling crypto, and the SEC rescinding its restrictive accounting bulletin.

Military lawyers are reviewing the request, which would involve asking state governors for volunteers from their Guard forces. The role of the Guard troops is yet to be defined, including whether they would provide transportation, security, detain migrants, or participate in arrests. This move follows President Trump's order to increase the deportation force by 20,000 officers, and it marks the first time Guard troops at the national level have been asked to assist in deportations.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop of 7.6% following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter results, which fell short of earnings expectations on both revenue and net income. The Chinese e-commerce giant is grappling with macroeconomic volatility and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, which has affected consumer sentiment in China. Despite the disappointing results, Alibaba's revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, and net income was up 279% off a low base. The company plans to invest aggressively in its "instant commerce" model to differentiate itself from competitors amidst an intense price war.</p>

          <p>President Trump made his first publicly known visit to a mosque during his presidency while in Abu Dhabi, part of a larger diplomatic tour through the Middle East. He removed his shoes, as customary, and praised the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque's beauty and culture. The visit underscores Trump's close ties with the UAE, built partly on the UAE's decision to normalize relations with Israel during his first term. This event contrasts with his earlier rhetoric during his 2016 campaign, where he suggested mosques should be under surveillance, as the Muslim community helped deliver Michigan to him in the November election.</p>

          <p>A House Republican bill proposes to increase the child tax credit, making the $2,000 credit permanent and raising the cap to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. However, the plan has been criticized for excluding low-income families and imposing restrictions on eligibility. The bill requires both parents to have a Social Security number if filing jointly, which could exclude millions of U.S. citizens and lawfully present children from receiving the credit. While middle-income families currently benefit the most from the existing credit, this new proposal does little for the neediest families.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has reported that cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data, demanding a $20 million ransom. The company estimates the incident may cost up to $400 million to fix. Although passwords and private keys were not compromised, sensitive data such as names, addresses, and government ID images were exposed. Coinbase detected the breach independently, terminated the employees involved, warned affected customers, and enhanced fraud monitoring protections. The company is cooperating with law enforcement and has established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest of those responsible.</p>
