          <p>U.S. steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the commercial viability of rare earths mining at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. The move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce dependency on China for these critical minerals, which are essential for manufacturing electric vehicles, weapons systems, and semiconductors. Following the announcement, the company's shares surged by approximately 17% as investors reacted positively to the potential for domestic mineral independence.</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period continues, beneficiaries are advised to carefully review their options, though the ongoing federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information. Experts suggest waiting to finalize 2026 coverage decisions until the government reopens to ensure all questions can be answered, particularly regarding changes in prescription drug plans and the benefits of Medicare Advantage versus original Medicare. Despite potential staffing shortages at call centers, online resources like the Medicare Plan Finder remain operational for comparing plans.</p>

He expressed skepticism about the choice of Hungary as a venue, citing its Russia-friendly government and the historical precedent of the failed 1994 Budapest Memorandum. This development comes as the EU considers a phase-out of Russian gas imports and a new sanctions package to further pressure Moscow.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent drop in homicides, Chicago continues to grapple with a high rate of violent crime, a problem often oversimplified in political discourse. The article details the tragic killing of off-duty police officer Aréanah Preston, using her story to illustrate the deep-seated issues of disinvestment, neighborhood decay, and systemic challenges facing the city's Black and Latino communities. It critiques politicians for minimizing the problem while also highlighting community-led efforts and violence interruption programs as potential paths forward beyond policing alone.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut's UK operations face significant downsizing after its franchise operator, DC London Pie Limited, went into administration, leading to the closure of 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations. This move will result in the loss of 1,210 jobs, although Pizza Hut's global owner, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to acquire and save 64 other sites, preserving 1,276 positions. The closures reflect the brand's ongoing struggle to compete in an increasingly upmarket and competitive pizza market in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>New York Giants linebacker Brian Burns openly expressed his frustration with the team's defensive play-calling following a 33-32 loss to the Denver Broncos. The Giants surrendered a 19-point lead, with Burns caught on video criticizing the decision to use a soft "drop eight" coverage on the final, game-winning drive. Despite his anger, Burns later took personal responsibility for defensive lapses, acknowledging his own missed opportunities to secure the victory for the 2-5 team.</p>

Other techniques involve preempting criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." method to validate their feedback while still asserting one's own ideas, thereby conserving energy and improving the working relationship.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include higher initial government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale value, and the rapid pace of technological advancement in battery range and features. However, this trend may be shifting as a larger volume of more affordable, mainstream used EVs is expected to enter the market, potentially stabilizing their long-term value.</p>

Other requirements include completing credit counseling and avoiding suspicious financial activities before filing, such as running up luxury purchases, which can lead to denial of the case.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine, suggesting that the conflict should be frozen along the current lines of contact. This proposal would effectively cede control of occupied Ukrainian territory, including most of the Donbas region, to Russia. The statement came after a tense White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected any territorial concessions, and a lengthy phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, setting the stage for a potential summit.</p>

          <p>The Economist has released its third annual "Carrie Bradshaw index," which identifies the most affordable U.S. cities for individuals to live alone based on the ability to spend no more than 30% of the median local income on a studio apartment. Wichita, Kansas, topped the list as the most affordable city, where the median wage is 75% higher than what is needed to rent a typical studio. The report noted a trend of increasing unaffordability, with cities in Texas like Dallas and Austin moving into the unaffordable category this year.</p>

          <p>In his first year in office, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has taken a notably active role on the global stage, making numerous diplomatic visits and engaging in major international issues. He has offered to send peacekeepers to Gaza and supported a U.S.-led peace plan, strengthening ties with Washington while also finalizing a long-negotiated economic partnership with the European Union. While his administration sees this as affirming Indonesia's role as a major democratic Muslim-majority nation, some foreign policy analysts critique his approach as overly personal and lacking long-term strategic coordination.</p>

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a Mexican cartel leader known as "El Gato" and a former FBI top ten fugitive, is facing a new federal charge of continuing a criminal enterprise. This charge is connected to his alleged role in orchestrating the 2013 murder-for-hire of a man in a Southlake, Texas shopping center, an act authorities describe as a revenge plot. The new indictment makes Villareal-Hernandez, who was arrested in Mexico in 2023 after years on the run, potentially eligible for the death penalty if convicted.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party leadership is convening to finalize a new five-year plan that must address critical economic challenges, balancing strategic investment in high-tech industries with the need to stimulate weak domestic consumption. Faced with geopolitical pressure from the U.S. on technology access, Beijing is prioritizing industrial policy to achieve self-sufficiency in areas like semiconductors. However, analysts note this focus on supply-side development leaves fewer resources to boost household spending, which is crucial for rebalancing the sputtering, export-driven economy.</p>

          <p>The article argues that state Medicaid programs should cover new anti-obesity drugs like Ozempic, known as GLP-1s, for the estimated 14 million eligible low-income Americans. While acknowledging the high initial cost to state budgets, it contends that these expenses are overstated and would be partially offset by long-term healthcare savings from reduced obesity-related diseases. The author suggests that prices will fall over time due to market competition and that denying access to these near-miracle drugs exacerbates health inequalities for those living in poverty.</p>
