        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a comprehensive shake-up of driving laws, including mandatory eye tests for motorists over 70 when renewing their licenses every three years. Other key proposals include lowering the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standards and implementing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These reforms, prompted by a coroner's concerns over the UK's "laxest" licensing system, aim to significantly enhance road safety and reduce the annual toll of 1,600 deaths and thousands of injuries. The strategy also considers tests for conditions like dementia and easier drug-driving prosecutions, marking the biggest change in decades.</p>

          <p>Germany achieved a record 223.3 million overnight stays in the first half of the year, with robust domestic travel offsetting a decline in foreign visitors. This strong performance underscores the resilience and significance of the internal tourism sector for the German economy. Meanwhile, a separate report from the Left Party indicates that more than 11% of individuals deported from Germany in 2024 were children or teenagers. This statistic highlights a critical aspect of Germany's immigration policies, prompting discussions on the humanitarian implications for young people affected by these measures.</p>

          <p>Upcoming talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, aimed at ending the Ukraine war, are already seen as a significant win for Moscow, its economy, and global markets. Experts view Putin's invitation to U.S. soil without preconditions as a triumph, especially given Russia's battlefield gains and economic struggles under sanctions. Concerns persist that Ukraine may be forced to cede territory without its direct involvement in negotiations. The financial markets reacted positively to the news, though defense stocks initially fell, prompting advice to "buy on that weakness" due to potential continued defense spending regardless of the peace outcome.

          <p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the country will recognize a Palestinian state, formalizing the decision at the UN General Assembly in September. This move, aligning with similar signals from France, Britain, and Canada, comes amidst growing criticism of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and Israeli military plans. Albanese stated the recognition is contingent on Palestinian Authority commitments, including no Hamas role, Gaza demilitarization, and elections. He emphasized that a two-state solution is humanity's best hope for peace, dismissing Israeli criticism and viewing the action as a practical contribution to building momentum for a lasting resolution.</p>

This "unprecedented" arrangement follows prior U.S. bans on powerful AI chips to China due to national security concerns, despite lobbying efforts by Nvidia's CEO. Experts question if a financial payment truly mitigates national security risks, highlighting the high cost of market access amid escalating tech trade tensions. The deal signals a complex dynamic where Washington seeks to control advanced technology while allowing U.S. companies to compete in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant gorse fire on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh was likely caused by human activity, according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, though the exact cause is still under investigation. The blaze, which spread rapidly across the popular hillside, was brought under control overnight with no reported casualties. This incident follows previous fires in the area and comes amidst a warm, dry summer in Scotland, prompting several wildfire warnings. Experts note that most wildfires in Scotland are human-induced, and climate change is contributing to larger, more frequent, and harder-to-extinguish blazes due to increased vegetation.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court faces a formal request to overturn its landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Former Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, jailed for refusing marriage licenses to a gay couple, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict, arguing for First Amendment protection and claiming the original decision was "egregiously wrong." This appeal is part of a renewed conservative campaign to reverse the precedent, despite strong majority support for equal marriage rights among Americans. Legal experts view Davis's bid as a long shot, but the case highlights ongoing efforts to challenge LGBTQ+ rights in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>US-China Tariff Truce Extension Uncertain Amidst Escalating Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>The extension of the U.S.-China tariff truce remains uncertain as a deadline looms, with no clear indication from President Trump on prolonging the agreement. Despite prior reductions in duties, trade between the two largest economies has been significantly impacted, with China's exports to the U.S. shrinking. A potential deal could involve China increasing purchases of U.S. goods, but new issues like "transshipment" of goods through third countries and semiconductor export controls complicate negotiations. The recent Nvidia deal, where companies pay the U.S. government for export licenses, is cited as a "monetization of U.S. trade policy," raising concerns among experts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Tesla is seeking to expand its energy business by applying for an electricity supply license in the United Kingdom, potentially competing with major British energy firms as early as next year. The application, submitted by Tesla Energy Ventures to the regulator Ofgem, signals the company's move to diversify beyond electric vehicles into solar energy generation and battery storage. This strategic expansion comes as Tesla faces a prolonged sales slump in the European car market, including significant drops in new car sales in the UK and Germany last month, making the energy sector a key growth area.

          <p>Beijing has unexpectedly eased property buying restrictions, allowing residents to purchase new and second-hand homes outside the Fifth Ring Road, a major suburban highway. This move, earlier than market expectations, is seen as a positive step aligning with the central government's efforts to remove buying curbs in non-central areas. Analysts believe this proactive measure will strengthen market confidence, potentially prompting other major Chinese cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen to follow suit. The policy aims to address concerns about the deteriorating sales and home-price data in the property sector, signaling government support for market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has strongly condemned Israel's security cabinet-approved plan for a Gaza City takeover, which would displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Speaking at the UN, Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong asserted that military solutions are not viable and urged an immediate ceasefire to save lives and secure hostage releases. He emphasized that Gaza is inalienable Palestinian territory and any attempt to alter its population or territorial structure must be rejected. Fu also called for urgent action to address the worsening famine in Gaza, reinforcing China's stance on a two-state solution.</p>

          <h2>Turkish Football Clubs' High Spending Raises Concerns Amidst Economic Woes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey's Super Lig is emerging as a significant player in the football transfer market, with top clubs like Galatasaray and Fenerbahce making record-breaking signings despite substantial debt. This spending spree, attracting international stars, raises questions about its sustainability given Turkey's economic struggles. Some analysts suggest the government tacitly supports this as a "bread and circuses" tactic to distract from inflation and unemployment, using football's popularity to control public sentiment. Critics argue that clubs operate with close state ties, benefiting from debt restructuring and lax enforcement of financial regulations, enabling continued high spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Two Japanese Boxers Die from Brain Injuries After Same Event</h2>

          <p>Two Japanese boxers, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, tragically died from brain injuries sustained in separate bouts at the same Tokyo event earlier this month. Both suffered subdural hematomas, with Kotari collapsing after a 12-round draw and Urakawa after a knockout loss. These deaths, following another boxer's death in February, have prompted the Japanese Boxing Commission to reduce all Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation title bouts from 12 to 10 rounds. An emergency meeting is scheduled to discuss further safety measures, as the boxing community mourns the losses and faces pressure to enhance fighter protection.</p>
