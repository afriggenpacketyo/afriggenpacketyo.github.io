          <p>Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark is set to miss her fifth straight game with a groin injury, ruling her out of the upcoming matchup against the Los Angeles Sparks. This will be the ninth regular-season game Clark has missed this season, a stark contrast to her durable college and early pro career where she never missed a game. Head coach Stephanie White indicated that Clark participated in some drills but was not at full speed, with a final evaluation pending. Despite the absences, the Fever have won four of their last five games and hold a 9-8 record on the season.</p>

          <h2>Connecticut Law Permitting Quick Sale of Towed Cars Faces Criticism</h2>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law that allows towing companies to sell towed vehicles after just 15 days is being criticized as predatory. Critics and affected residents argue that private tow operators are targeting working-class and low-income neighborhoods, where people may struggle to quickly produce the hundreds of dollars needed to retrieve their cars. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of towing over 1,000 cars from a single apartment complex in two years. The company's owner defends the practice, stating he is simply enforcing the parking rules set by the apartment complexes.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County has become the largest wildfire in California this year, rapidly growing to over 70,800 acres with only 10% containment. Sparked in a rural area, the blaze has been fueled by hot and windy conditions, threatening 50 structures and prompting evacuation orders for more than 200 people. Over 600 personnel, 46 fire engines, and air tankers are battling the fire, which is now under a unified command involving Cal Fire, Los Padres National Forest, and the Bureau of Land Management. The cause of the fire remains under investigation as it continues to pose an immediate threat to life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's new tax bill eliminates federal taxes on Social Security, the legislation does not directly alter how benefits are taxed. Instead, it introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds, which can be applied to all income. Policy experts note this is far from a full repeal of the tax and will primarily benefit higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients will see no change. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California.

Seven people remain unaccounted for following the incident at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility, which also injured two others and destroyed several structures, including the property owner's home. Investigations have revealed the facility lacked local licenses to store fireworks, and the federal ATF has been called to assist Cal Fire.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The ruling clarifies an earlier order, effectively nullifying a lower court's injunction that had required due process protections before such a third-country removal. Justice Sotomayor, in a dissenting opinion, expressed grave concern, stating the government's plan sends the individuals to a country where they could face torture or death. This decision marks a significant legal victory for the administration's policy of deporting migrants to nations other than their country of origin.</p>

The craft, which dates back to the 12th century, is a struggling cottage industry, and artisans were shocked to learn their $10 sandals could be sold for hundreds of dollars.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against global warming due to their epic annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to burn that fat, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of approximately 55 million cars. The findings highlight a crucial, previously underestimated natural mechanism for mitigating climate change.</p>

The fraudsters appear to target unclaimed estates listed on a public government register, producing fake wills that name a gang member as the sole heir. The investigation highlights significant weaknesses in the digital probate system, which seems to be failing to detect suspicious claims and enabling serious tax fraud by undervaluing estates. Despite strong evidence of forgery, victims' families have been told they must pursue costly civil action to challenge the fraudulent wills.</p>

          <p>Germany began their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the eight-time champions secured the win, the performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears during the first half with a suspected knee injury. Gwinn, who has a history of two serious ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, casting doubt on her participation in the rest of the tournament. The win provides a positive start, but the potential loss of their captain is a significant blow.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order that will increase entry fees for international tourists at U.S. national parks and give American citizens preferential treatment in park lotteries and permitting. The order states that revenue from the higher fees will fund infrastructure improvements across federal recreation sites. In a separate and unrelated directive within the same order, Trump revoked a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the management of public lands. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of dismantling government DEI programs established under previous administrations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks outlines five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain preservatives linked to heart disease. The list also includes sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation and train taste buds to crave unhealthy options. The article advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean proteins to build healthy eating habits from childhood.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a dramatic five-run victory over India in the third T20 at The Oval, keeping the series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but Lauren Bell had captain Harmanpreet Kaur caught to clinch the win. The match featured a stunning collapse from England, who went from 137-0 to 171-9, and a game-changing spell of fast bowling from England's Lauren Filer. Despite a chaotic fielding performance with several dropped catches, England held their nerve to narrow India's series lead to 2-1 ahead of the fourth match.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, establishing the concept of a citizen. He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division, a bloody civil war between patriots and loyalists, which should provide perspective on current political polarization. Burns argued that history is a lifeline, and understanding the founders' flaws makes their achievements more accessible and inspiring. He believes the nation is held together by its founding words, which require constant engagement and learning to sustain the republic.</p>

          <p>Adult education programs across the United States are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration withheld $715 million in federal grant funding.

The sudden halt in funding has left program administrators scrambling to find answers and figure out how to continue operations. This move creates a significant challenge for adult learners who rely on these resources for educational and economic advancement, leaving their futures in limbo.</p>
