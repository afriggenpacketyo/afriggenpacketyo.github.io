          <p>Pakistan's leading independent human rights group, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), reports facing an intense government crackdown that severely impedes its work. The organization states that authorities have obstructed events, frozen its bank accounts, and threatened its staff, creating what activists call an increasingly authoritarian environment. While the government cites security concerns and denies placing restrictions on freedom of expression, the HRCP vows to persist in its mission. The group emphasizes its role as a neutral, evidence-based advocate for civil liberties in the country.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for the creation of an international center to coordinate global cooperation on artificial intelligence, aiming to counter what he describes as a "fragmented trend" in AI governance. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li advocated for a widely accepted global framework for AI. This proposal comes as China seeks to expand its influence in the rapidly evolving technology sector. The move is set against the backdrop of an intensifying technological competition with the United States, which recently announced its own policy framework to bolster American AI dominance.</p>

          <h2>Experts Identify Five Overlooked Areas in Hotel Rooms Prone to High Germ Levels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 04:00:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travel and housekeeping experts are highlighting several often-overlooked spots in hotel rooms that can harbor significant levels of bacteria. According to the article, decorative items like pillows and bed runners are rarely washed, and high-touch surfaces such as remote controls and light switches are major culprits for germs. Other areas of concern include bathtubs, which can be dirtier than toilets, as well as glassware and ice buckets that may not be properly cleaned between guests. Experts advise travelers to be cautious and consider wiping down surfaces or rinsing glasses upon check-in to ensure a cleaner stay.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army Daily, China's official military newspaper, has published a series of commentaries urging the force's political officers to improve their public image and reputation. The guidelines emphasize the need for unwavering loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, honesty in their professional duties, and integrity in the promotion process for soldiers. Observers suggest these directives are a response to recent misconduct by high-ranking generals. The commentaries signal Beijing's expectation that political cadres will play a key role in addressing and repairing the damage caused by corruption and disloyalty within the military's ranks.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a framework trade agreement. The high-stakes meeting aims to avert a threatened 30% U.S. tariff on EU goods, with sources suggesting a potential compromise involving a 15% tariff baseline. This potential deal is seen as crucial for stabilizing the world's largest bilateral trade relationship, which accounts for nearly 30% of global trade. The outcome is being closely watched as a less severe deal is considered preferable to an all-out trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

McIntosh arrives in historic form, having recently broken three world records, and is attempting to win five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has accomplished.

Conversely, U.S. sales have shown surprising strength, though it is unclear if this is due to consumers buying ahead of potential tariffs.

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank, California, executed a dramatic dive shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft, injuring two cabin crew members. The pilot received an alert about a nearby British fighter jet, prompting a rapid descent of 300 feet in just 36 seconds. Passengers described a panicked scene as some were thrown from their seats, with many fearing the plane was crashing. The aircraft was able to continue its flight to Las Vegas and land safely, and the Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been questioned by the U.S. Justice Department. The interview, which lasted for a day and a half, was conducted by Deputy Chief Todd Blanche. Maxwell's lawyer stated that she answered questions honestly about numerous individuals and that no offer of clemency was made for her cooperation. The questioning comes amid renewed attention on the Epstein case and President Trump's past association with him, though Trump has denied any wrongdoing and stated he has nothing to do with Epstein.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunis to denounce what they call President Kais Saied's increasingly authoritarian rule, four years after he dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree. Chanting "The people want the fall of the regime," demonstrators criticized the government for mass arrests of opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, effectively turning the country into an "open-air prison." Critics argue that Saied's actions have dismantled the country's democratic institutions and crushed dissent. The protest highlights the deep political divisions and growing fear within the nation once seen as a beacon of the Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing over 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program. This potential exodus would shrink NASA's civil servant personnel from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The departures come as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and navigates a period of leadership instability. NASA has stated that safety remains a top priority as it aims to become a more streamlined organization capable of pursuing its exploration and innovation goals.</p>
