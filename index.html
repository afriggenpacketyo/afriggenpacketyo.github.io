        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study found that 60% of workers in Singapore are living paycheck to paycheck, a figure significantly higher than the Asia-Pacific average. Experts attribute this trend to the city-state's high cost of living, soaring housing prices, and a cultural shift among younger generations who prioritize experiences and lifestyle spending over long-term savings. This financial pressure is compounded by real median income falling slightly since the pandemic, reducing the purchasing power of the average worker despite a strong economy.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a Rhode Island man who faked his own death and fled to Scotland to evade prosecution, has been found guilty of a 2008 sexual assault in a Utah court. Rossi, who insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight being framed, was extradited to the U.S. in January after being identified in a Glasgow hospital. The conviction marks a significant step towards justice for his victim after a bizarre, years-long international fugitive case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A government scheme in China aimed at boosting the economy by offering subsidized consumer loans may face a significant cultural hurdle. Many Chinese households, both older and younger, remain deeply averse to taking on debt for anything other than a mortgage, preferring to save rather than borrow for spending. This traditional financial prudence could blunt the effectiveness of the stimulus policy, which relies on citizens being willing to finance purchases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of State has officially added the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) to its list of foreign terrorist organizations. This designation is intended to bolster counterterrorism efforts in Pakistan and curtail the group's support networks. Analysts note that the move could also create an unexpected opportunity for counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and China, as the BLA has also been responsible for fatal attacks targeting Chinese nationals and interests in the region.</p>

          <p>More than 115 education scholars have signed an open letter condemning the Harvard Education Publishing Group for canceling a special issue of an academic journal dedicated to Palestine. The scholars label the abrupt scrapping of the nearly-completed issue as an act of "censorship" and "anti-Palestinian discrimination" that obstructs academic freedom. The publisher denied censorship, citing an inadequate review process, but the move has been widely criticized as a capitulation to political pressure.</p>
