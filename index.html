        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California and the federal government are currently in a court battle over President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The state argues the deployment was an illegal use of military force in civilian life under the Posse Comitatus Act, causing public fear. Conversely, the Justice Department contends the action was a legal and necessary measure to protect federal property and personnel during protests. The trial is examining whether the president has the authority to define a protest as a "rebellion" to justify such a deployment, with the judge questioning the administration's interpretation of the law.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated a strategic shift in ceasefire negotiations, now prioritizing a single comprehensive deal for the release of all remaining hostages, both living and deceased. This moves away from the previous phased approach, which he stated Hamas used for deception. Meanwhile, a Hamas delegation is in Cairo for preliminary talks as mediators see a potential window for a deal in the coming weeks. Concurrently, Israeli military operations have intensified in Gaza, particularly in Gaza City, resulting in significant Palestinian casualties as reported by the Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

The incident occurs as the UK Labour government implements new strategies to curb illegal crossings, including a 'one-in, one-out' returns agreement with France. The Conservatives have criticized the government for abandoning their Rwanda plan, arguing that Labour's policies have failed to deter the crossings.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Germany, known as the E3, have formally threatened to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran if it does not resume diplomatic negotiations regarding its nuclear program by the end of August. In a letter to the United Nations, the top diplomats stated their readiness to trigger the "snapback" mechanism, which would restore sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. This move follows a period of diplomatic stalemate and Iran's suspension of ties with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, after military strikes on its nuclear-related facilities. The E3 is urging Tehran to return to diplomacy and fully cooperate with the IAEA.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various NATO leaders before his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The discussion is seen as an effort to include European and Ukrainian perspectives, as allies have expressed concerns about being excluded from peace talks that could favor Moscow. Zelenskyy has emphasized that "talks about us, without us, will not work." The White House has framed the high-stakes Putin summit as a "feel-out meeting" for Trump to assess the Russian leader's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues against framing China's advancements in green technology as a threatening "China Shock 2.0." Instead of disrupting existing industries, China is actively building new ones, particularly in electric vehicles, clean energy, and AI, which benefits the entire world. The author highlights that in 2023, China installed more solar capacity than the rest of the world combined and is a primary driver in reducing global clean energy costs. The piece concludes that China is not merely supporting the green transition but is effectively underwriting it, positioning itself as a leader for the 21st century.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Barbie doll has its origins in a German character named Lilli, who first appeared in a 1952 comic strip in the Bild tabloid. Created to appeal to male readers, Lilli was a sexually suggestive character often interpreted as a high-class call girl. In 1955, she was turned into a plastic doll, which was primarily marketed to men as a gag gift. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll in Switzerland, bought the rights, and redesigned her into Barbie, who debuted in 1959 and became a global phenomenon, while production of the original Lilli doll ceased.</p>

          <p>Applications to refinance home loans jumped 23% last week, reaching their highest level since April, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Overall mortgage application volume rose 10.9%, with the ARM share of applications reaching its highest point since 2022. The trend suggests homeowners are actively seeking savings amid fluctuating interest rates, even if it means taking on riskier loan products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is currently moving west across the Atlantic and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by late this week, potentially becoming the season's first major hurricane with winds over 110 mph. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will likely move near or just north of the Leeward Islands over the weekend, and interests there are urged to monitor its progress. While early computer models suggest a low probability of a direct U.S. landfall, forecasters caution that it is too soon to be certain and expect significant surf and rip currents along the East Coast regardless.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances has announced a massive $3 billion, five-year investment to expand its U.S. operations, which will create over 1,000 jobs. As part of this plan, the company will shift production of some refrigerators and water heaters from China and gas ranges from Mexico to its plants in states like Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. This move continues the company's strategy of reshoring manufacturing, a decision accelerated by U.S. tariffs on foreign goods. The investment will focus on modernizing plants and upskilling the American workforce to handle the increased domestic production.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark U.S. court ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, AI startup Perplexity has made a $34.5 billion offer to buy the Chrome browser. The Department of Justice is proposing that Google be forced to sell Chrome as a remedy for its anticompetitive behavior. Losing Chrome would be a significant blow to Google, as the browser is a critical gateway for its lucrative advertising business, which relies on the vast user data it collects.

Furthermore, a significant increase in stock-based compensation negatively impacted the company's operating margin, pressuring profitability despite a growing customer base. While management raised its guidance for the upcoming quarter, investors are now closely watching the company's ability to manage capacity constraints and improve margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of prehistoric whale that lived 26 million years ago, piecing it together from a well-preserved skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast. Named Janjucetus dullardi after the local who discovered it, the creature was a small, dolphin-sized predator with sharp, slicing teeth. It belonged to the mammalodontids, a group of distant, smaller relatives of today's massive filter-feeding whales. The discovery provides a new window into the evolution of whales and highlights the region as a crucial site for understanding their ancient history.</p>

          <p>The reboot of the animated series "King of the Hill" returns to a suburban Arlen, Texas, that feels both familiar and, in today's climate, somewhat fantastical. This analysis suggests the show's focus on close-knit neighborly relationships and community support presents an idealistic vision that contrasts with the reality of modern social and political fragmentation. While the show touches on contemporary issues like lockdowns and technology-induced isolation, it largely avoids the deep cultural divisions of present-day America. This allows it to maintain its gentle, character-driven humor and champion a message of tolerance and communal responsibility.</p>

          <p>This article summarizes an episode of NPR's podcast, The Indicator, which examines the economic impact of recent cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The episode explores how the reduction in benefits, part of a new tax and spending law, affects not only the families who rely on the program but also the small, independent grocery stores that serve them. For many of these businesses, SNAP transactions represent a significant portion of their revenue. The cuts could therefore threaten the financial viability of these crucial community stores, making their survival even more challenging.</p>

Greenberg believes that scarcity would enhance the value of Test matches rather than diminish it.

Financial data firm Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point," indicating increased competition among lenders. This relief for homebuyers comes as 1.6 million fixed-rate deals are set to expire in 2025.

Uncertainty surrounding tax rules and business investment further complicates the outlook.
