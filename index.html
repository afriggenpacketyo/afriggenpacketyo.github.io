          <p>Emma Raducanu lost to Maya Joint in the second round at Eastbourne, stating she needs to refocus before Wimbledon. Raducanu, a former US Open champion, lost in a tight match after rallying from behind in the deciding set. She mentioned receiving "some really bad news" earlier in the week, affecting her mental state and contributing to her fatigue. Raducanu plans to rest before starting preparations for Wimbledon, which begins in just a few days.

          <p>BP's stock experienced volatility due to reports of a potential acquisition by Shell, which Shell has since denied. The Wall Street Journal reported early-stage talks between the two companies, causing BP's shares to jump significantly before retracting after Shell's denial. It's suggested that if a deal were to occur, BP would likely be divided and sold to multiple companies.

          <p>This article discusses the potential interest earnings from depositing $20,000 into a 2-year or 1-year CD account. With online banks offering rates over 4%, savers could earn significant interest, but they need to keep the money untouched for the entire term to avoid penalties. A 2-year CD at 4.40% could yield $1,798.72, while a 1-year CD at the same rate could yield $880.00. The article suggests that with expected interest rate cuts, savers should act proactively to secure high rates now. (not investment advice)</p>

He acknowledged the existence of the Defense Intelligence Agency's report but claimed its data was insufficient due to the timing of the assessment.

          <p>The Federal Reserve proposed easing a key capital rule for large Wall Street banks, a move that aims to increase Treasury market liquidity. The proposal would reduce the top-tier capital big banks must hold, potentially freeing up capital for lower-risk assets like Treasurys. While some officials support the change, arguing it will build resilience in Treasury markets, others oppose it, suggesting it could lead to banks distributing capital to shareholders rather than increasing Treasury intermediation. The leverage ratio has been criticized for penalizing banks for holding Treasurys, and the new regulations align with Basel standards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague concluded with a commitment from allies to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP within a decade, marking a significant rise from the current 2% guideline. The agreement stipulates that 3.5% of the spending must be allocated to core defense, while the remaining 1.5% can be used for defense-related expenditures like infrastructure and cyber security. Despite concerns about Donald Trump's past comments on collective defense, the summit reaffirmed NATO's commitment to Article Five. The summit also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with leaders pledging continued support, although a specific condemnation of Russia was absent from the final statement.</p>

Home equity loans have fixed rates, while HELOC rates are variable, allowing borrowers to take advantage of future rate drops.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang identified robotics as the company's biggest market opportunity after artificial intelligence. Huang stated that self-driving cars would be the first major commercial application for robotics, which requires Nvidia's data center AI chips for training software. Nvidia's automotive and robotics divisions reported $567 million in quarterly sales, up 72% annually. Huang envisions a future with billions of robots and autonomous vehicles powered by Nvidia technology, as the company evolves into an "AI infrastructure" provider.</p>

          <p>Most NATO allies have committed to increasing defense spending to 5% of their national GDPs to ensure continued US engagement. The declaration states that at least 3.5% of GDP will be spent on hard defense, with up to 1.5% for defense-related investments. However, some members, like Spain, Slovakia, and Belgium, have sought to opt out or seek flexibility in meeting the target. There are also concerns about the US's long-term commitment to the alliance, despite President Trump's reassurance of support.</p>

Discussions have accelerated, and Norgaard is reportedly keen to join Arteta's side.</p>

          <h2>Government Plans Welfare Changes Aimed at Reducing Spending</h2>

          <p>The government is planning welfare changes to reduce the working-age welfare bill by about Â£5 billion a year by the end of the decade. These changes include making it harder to access Personal Independence Payments (Pip) and cutting the rate of incapacity benefit. The government aims to control the rising number of people claiming working-age benefits and their impact on public finances. Official impact assessments estimate that these reforms will leave about 250,000 additional people in relative poverty by 2030.</p>
