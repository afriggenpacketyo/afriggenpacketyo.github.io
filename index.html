          <p>In a bold move, Israel has initiated a military operation targeting Iran's nuclear program, citing an existential threat to its survival. The operation, dubbed "Rising Lion," is characterized as a preemptive strike designed to roll back Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iranian officials have vowed a harsh response, escalating regional tensions.

          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel launched a series of airstrikes targeting locations in Iran related to its nuclear program. The strikes resulted in the death of Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, along with two leading nuclear scientists, Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, vowed to avenge the attacks, while Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, declared a state of emergency and warned of potential missile and drone attacks. The strikes led to a surge in oil prices and a drop in U.S. stock futures, with the U.S. clarifying it was not involved but had been briefed beforehand by Israel, emphasizing the action was deemed necessary for Israel's self-defense. </p>

          <p>A federal court has intervened in the Trump administration's decision to deploy the California National Guard, raising questions about presidential authority and state sovereignty. The court's ruling, temporarily stayed by an appeals court, underscores the ongoing tensions between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement. Governor Newsom has criticized the deployment as an unnecessary militarization of the state, while the Trump administration defends its actions as necessary to maintain law and order. The legal battle highlights the delicate balance of power between the executive branch and state governments. </p>

          <p>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused a court order that would have required President Trump to return control of California National Guard troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom. This emergency stay came after a U.S. District Judge ruled Trump's mobilization of Guard members during immigration raid protests was unlawful. The appeals court scheduled a hearing for the case, meaning the National Guard will remain federalized through the weekend. Newsom had filed the lawsuit, arguing the deployment was a breach of state sovereignty designed to inflame the situation. </p>

Earlier, a federal judge in California issued a temporary restraining order that would have blocked Trump's move to deploy California National Guard troops during protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles and returned control of the California National Guard to Gov.

While preemptive attacks are considered justifiable under international law when thwarting an imminent attack, preventive wars, based on a threat that is real but not imminent, are often viewed as illegal and immoral. Israel's actions, reminiscent of historical ill-advised preventive actions, carry significant moral and practical risks. The Israeli government claims the attacks are necessary due to Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and genocidal intentions toward Israel. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily halted a judge's ruling that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay in response to the government's emergency motion. The appeals court ordered a hearing before the three-judge panel for June 17 on the case. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer had previously found that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize members of the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles. </p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took unilateral action and warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. interests or personnel. Israeli officials reportedly notified the U.S. before beginning the strikes, which Israel claims are necessary due to Iran's nuclear ambitions. The U.S. had already partially evacuated embassy staff from Iraq amid concerns that an attack by Israel could provoke Iran to retaliate by targeting U.S. military installations. </p>
