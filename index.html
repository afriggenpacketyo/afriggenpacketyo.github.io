          <p>Shares of EssilorLuxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban, experienced a significant jump of nearly 6% following reports of a substantial investment from Meta. The social media giant has reportedly acquired a minority stake in the eyewear company as it deepens its push into AI-powered wearable technology. This move builds on their existing partnership, which produced the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and signals Meta's growing commitment to developing its own hardware. The companies also plan to release AI-powered glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>TV presenter Gregg Wallace is facing new allegations of misconduct from an additional 50 people, adding to previous claims which he denies. The accusations, primarily involving inappropriate sexual comments and behavior, have led to his dismissal from the show "MasterChef." Prominent figures, including Baroness Helena Kennedy, have publicly warned Wallace against dismissing the claims, while broadcast union Bectu has also received more revelations. Wallace has defended himself on social media, stating an investigation cleared him of the most serious allegations.</p>

          <p>German police have detained a 27-year-old man in connection with a suspected Islamist terror plot following raids on multiple properties across the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Authorities stated that the investigation, initially focused on commercial fraud, uncovered evidence that money from the scheme was intended to finance an attack. The raids were conducted to prevent the plot from advancing and to gather more information about the circumstances. The state's interior minister praised the police action for successfully preventing potential terrorist activity.</p>

          <p>A recently declassified internal CIA review suggests that top intelligence officials, including former CIA Director John Brennan, manipulated intelligence to frame Donald Trump during the 2016 election. The report alleges that Brennan pushed to include the unverified Steele dossier in the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) despite objections from senior agency experts who warned it could damage the report's credibility. According to the article, this was part of a coordinated effort by officials like James Comey and James Clapper to create a false narrative of collusion with Russia. The review has prompted calls for accountability for those who allegedly weaponized their positions for political purposes.</p>

          <p>A group of Senate Democrats is introducing legislation to create a new, independent inspector general position specifically to oversee the Executive Office of the President. The bill, sponsored by Senator Adam Schiff, aims to establish a permanent watchdog to root out fraud, abuse, and misconduct within the White House, regardless of which party is in power. Proponents argue this check on executive power is long overdue, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest and the need for accountability at the highest levels of government. The proposal faces significant hurdles in the Republican-controlled Congress and is likely to be viewed as a partisan move by the administration.</p>

          <p>As Texas responds to devastating floods, it is heavily relying on federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an agency President Trump has proposed eliminating. Ironically, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and the state's top emergency official are part of a council tasked with recommending changes to FEMA, with Abbott previously stating that states can operate more effectively than the federal agency. This situation highlights a contradiction, as state officials who advocate for reducing federal disaster response are now depending on it to manage a major crisis.

          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to pay £100 million towards affordable housing to conclude an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The probe examined whether the companies had illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as pricing and sales incentives. By agreeing to the payment and committing not to share such data in the future, the firms avoid a formal ruling on whether they broke the law, and they do not admit any wrongdoing. The CMA stated this resolution is a swift and effective way to ensure the market works competitively going forward.</p>

          <p>South Korea has sent six North Korean fishermen back to their home country after they were rescued in two separate incidents earlier this year. The fishermen's boats had drifted across the maritime border into South Korean waters. Seoul's Ministry of Unification confirmed the repatriation, stating that all six men had expressed a desire to return to North Korea and were returned with their full consent. The event occurs as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung adopts a less hawkish approach towards Pyongyang, seeking to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico, has resulted in the deaths of at least three people, including a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. The flooding was exacerbated by heavy monsoonal rains falling on burn scars from previous wildfires, causing the Rio Ruidoso to rise to a record-breaking 20 feet. Emergency crews conducted dozens of swift-water rescues, and a house was filmed being swept away by the torrent. The governor has signed an emergency declaration request to secure federal resources for the response.</p>

          <p>To combat a massive backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in UK criminal courts, a former senior judge has recommended a series of fundamental reforms, including the use of judge-only trials. Sir Brian Leveson's report suggests that some cases, such as fraud and bribery, could be decided by judges alone to speed up the justice process and avoid a "total system collapse." While some legal experts and the Magistrates' Association support the proposals to alleviate delays, criminal barristers have raised concerns, arguing that the right to a trial by one's peers is a central and essential part of the justice system.</p>

Dr. Chris Webster testified that his suspicion was raised when Patterson presented with mild symptoms and gave a far-fetched explanation that the toxic mushrooms came from a major supermarket. He noted her lack of a concerned reaction for her relatives, who were gravely ill nearby, which solidified his belief in her guilt. A jury has since convicted Patterson of murdering three people and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a meal containing death cap mushrooms.</p>

The CBI is calling for urgent action, including lighter regulation, better marketing, and tax incentives to encourage investment in British firms.

          <p>A report indicates that Russia has confiscated assets worth around $50 billion over the past three years, highlighting the country's shift towards a more state-controlled "fortress Russia" economic model. The seizures, which have targeted both foreign and domestic assets, have been justified on grounds ranging from national security and corruption to violations of privatization laws. This trend underscores a significant move away from the open, free-market economy envisioned after the fall of the Soviet Union. A law firm has advised business owners to minimize vulnerabilities, such as ties to "unfriendly" countries, to avoid asset seizure. (not investment advice)</p>

These private companies, which compete with state-contracted services and are credited with lowering fares and improving service on lines like the East Coast Main Line, now face an uncertain future. The new transport secretary has ordered the industry regulator to take a more rigorous approach to approving new open access applications, raising fears that the government aims to protect its new state-run entity from competition.

The chair of LACA, a school food organization, stated that schools are increasingly forced to subsidize the cost of free school meals. A recent government increase of just 3p per meal is considered insufficient to cover the actual cost, which caterers estimate is about 80p higher. This funding gap forces difficult decisions that compromise the quality and size of lunches served to millions of pupils daily.</p>

A recent case in London, where men were convicted of setting fire to a warehouse storing supplies for Ukraine, offered a rare look into how Russia's intelligence services allegedly recruit young, amateur proxies online.
