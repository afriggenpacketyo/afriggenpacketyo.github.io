          <p>Bill Pulte, President Trump's housing finance chief, declined to reveal the source of his "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud during a CNBC interview. Pulte stated that disclosing his sources would be reckless, while CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin suggested that revealing the source could dispel perceptions of political weaponization. Pulte bristled at the suggestion that he needed help explaining his actions, leading to a tense exchange. The incident raises questions about the motivations behind Pulte's targeting of Cook.

          <p>A report by the African Union estimates that Africa loses approximately $88 billion annually due to tax evasion, money laundering, and corruption, depriving governments of crucial revenue for public services. Experts highlight that multinational corporations and corrupt elites contribute to this issue by shifting profits to tax havens. While some progress has been made, such as automatic exchange of information agreements, global geopolitical changes and high debt levels exacerbate Africa's vulnerability. The report underscores the urgent need for greater transparency and cooperation to combat illegal financial flows and promote economic sovereignty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kim Jong Un's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, accompanied her father to Beijing, attending a military parade and meeting with President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin. This marks her first known visit to a foreign country and has led analysts to speculate that she is being positioned as a potential successor to her father. While it was once considered unlikely that a woman would lead North Korea, her recent appearances and elevated titles suggest a shift in the regime's thinking. However, some analysts believe that resistance from the military and adherence to Confucian values may pose challenges to her ascension. Optimism score is not applicable to this article.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a Category 4 storm, is currently located in the Pacific Ocean and is moving westward toward Hawaii. As of Thursday morning, the storm's maximum sustained winds were topping 140 mph, with little change in strength forecast over the next day or so. The National Hurricane Center expects a turn toward the west-northwest on Friday, with a gradual increase in forward speed as Kiko approaches the Hawaiian Islands from the east. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect as of Thursday, but tropical-storm-force winds could start affecting Hawaii on Sunday. The article reports on the hurricane's projected path and potential impact on Hawaii.</p>

          <p>With elevated interest rates on personal loans and credit cards, homeowners can leverage their home equity through HELOCs and home equity loans for more affordable borrowing. As of September 4, 2025, average home equity loan rates range from 8.22% to 8.37%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. HELOCs offer variable interest rates and a revolving line of credit, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed interest rates. These options also offer potential tax benefits for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations, but homeowners should carefully consider their budget and financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The possibility of achieving immortality through organ transplants was discussed between President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin. While organ transplants can save lives and advancements in medicine have extended the lifespan of transplanted organs, the process involves risks. Scientists are exploring the use of genetically-altered pigs and growing new organs using human cells to overcome rejection issues. These advances are focused on treating illness rather than achieving immortality, with experts speculating that living to 125 years old may be the upper limit.
