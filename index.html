          <p>A new bill supported by President Trump proposes to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%, aiming to incentivize the construction of more fabrication plants in the United States. This legislation builds upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, further encouraging companies like Intel and TSMC to onshore their advanced manufacturing operations. The bill reflects Washington's ongoing strategy to strengthen the domestic chip supply chain and reduce dependency on Asia, representing a continued focus on bolstering the nation's technology sector. The measure has passed the Senate and now awaits further action in the House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has faced criticism from Indian fashion critics and officials for showcasing sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week that closely resemble traditional Kolhapuri chappals. Following a social media outcry and a formal request from the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, a Prada executive acknowledged the design's inspiration from the handcrafted Indian footwear. The company stated the sandals are in an early design phase and committed to a dialogue with Indian artisan communities. The incident has prompted calls in India to patent the traditional sandal design to prevent future global copyright infringements.</p>

The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who oppose Chinese rule and is expected to be contested by Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next leader.

Santander intends to fully integrate TSB into its UK group, which likely means the TSB brand name will disappear from the High Street, following the path of previous acquisitions like Abbey and Alliance & Leicester.

Officials attributed the systemic failures to the previous administration's lack of meaningful safeguards, which allowed vulnerable children to be placed in dangerous situations.

The deal's success hinges on Hamas's acceptance and the specific conditions, such as the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal and prisoner releases, which are not yet public. A key challenge is Israeli domestic politics, as Prime Minister Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners oppose a permanent ceasefire and could collapse his government. The 60-day term may be a political maneuver to placate these factions while creating a window for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese luxury jeweller Laopu Gold surged 15% to a record high after a one-year lock-up period expired, allowing pre-listing investors to sell their holdings. Instead of a sell-off, investors eagerly bought the newly available 69 million shares, reflecting strong confidence in the company's growth prospects. Laopu's stock has risen over 1,300% since its 2024 debut, driven by strong branding, pricing power, and impressive same-store sales growth. Analysts point to the company's powerful sales momentum and potential for overseas expansion as key drivers of its continued success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has explicitly targeted "disorderly low-price competition" as a problem that requires government regulation. The statement, made at a high-level economic meeting, marks a more direct characterization of the intense price wars affecting many Chinese industries. Beijing views this phenomenon as a threat to the economy because it harms innovation, reduces efficiency, and hinders industrial upgrading. The focus on this issue signals a potential policy shift to guide companies toward improving product quality rather than simply slashing prices to gain market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over the editing of a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris. The lawsuit alleged election interference due to discretionary editorial choices, a claim legal experts considered weak. The settlement, which includes no apology but covers Trump's legal fees, is seen by critics as a blow to journalistic independence, potentially driven by Paramount's desire to ensure its sale to Skydance Media receives regulatory approval from the Trump-led FCC.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of "30% or 35%" on Japan if a new trade agreement is not reached before a July 9 deadline. This would be a significant increase from the current 10% levy that was put in place temporarily to allow for negotiations. Trump expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo could be finalized in time, while also criticizing Japan's policies on US rice imports. The threat escalates trade tensions between the two allies as the deadline looms, with Japan stating it will not make concessions that harm its agricultural sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Halts Some Missile and Munitions Deliveries to Ukraine Citing Low Stockpiles</h2>

          <p>The Pentagon has paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine, including critical air defense interceptors and other precision munitions, due to concerns that US military stockpiles have fallen to dangerously low levels. A White House spokesperson stated the decision was made to prioritize America's own security interests after a global review of military assistance. This move represents a significant blow to Ukraine's war effort, as it relies heavily on these systems to defend against relentless Russian missile and drone attacks. The halt comes as Russian forces continue to make gradual advances in southeastern Ukraine.</p>
